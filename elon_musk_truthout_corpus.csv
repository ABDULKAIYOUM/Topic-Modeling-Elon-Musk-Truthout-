An internal document bolsters warnings that the hunt for fraud is a pretext for slashing Social Security benefits. An internal Trump administration document reportedly shows that anti-fraud checks recently installed at the Social Security agency have found just two cases of potentially improper benefit claims out of more than 110,000 — a rate of 0.0018%. The documents, first reported Thursday by Nextgov/FCW , further undercut President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s narrative that Social Security is brimming with fraud. Musk falsely claimed in March that “40% of the calls into Social Security were fraudulent.” The anti-fraud checks for Social Security have been applied only to benefit claims made over the phone. According to the internal document, “No significant fraud has been detected from the flagged cases.” Earlier this year, amid widespread outrage, the Social Security Administration (SSA) walked back a proposal to scrap many of its phone-based benefit claim services. Nextgov/FCW noted Thursday that the Trump administration’s deployment of the anti-fraud tools beginning last month “did cause delays, as SSA changed its phone procedures to add the checks on the backend.” “The lags stem from the three-day hold placed on telephone claims in order to run the anti-fraud , a move that ‘delays payments and benefits to customers, despite an extremely low risk of fraud,'” Nextgov/FCW reported, citing the internal document. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a statement that “the Trump-Musk Social Security takeover has only meant more chaos and confusion for Americans.” “Every one of DOGE’s so-called ‘mistakes’ is a backdoor cut to people’s benefits,” said Warren. “There’s nothing efficient about making it harder for people to access the checks they’ve earned and are owed.” On social media, Warren called the revelations in the internal administration document “a HUGE scandal.” This is a HUGE scandal. Elon Musk, JD Vance, and Trump are lying about Social Security fraud. Internal documents show DOGE found "no significant fraud"—but did slow retirement claim processing by 25%. Nothing efficient about making it harder for people to get their benefits. It’s long been clear that Social Security fraud is minuscule, with an inspector general report published last year estimating that just 0.84% of Social Security benefits paid out between 2015 and 2022 were dispensed improperly — and even those improper payments were not necessarily fraudulent . The new reporting out Thursday bolstered warnings that the Trump administration’s hunt for fraud is a mere pretext for slashing Social Security benefits and weakening the program. “Turns out there ISN’T rampant Social Security fraud, but Elon’s witch hunt, driven by his insane conspiracy theories, IS keeping seniors from getting their benefits as quickly as they should be,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) wrote on social media. “THIS is Republican governing: hunting for nonexistent fraud while breaking Social Security.” Frank Bisignano, the newly confirmed SSA administrator, has close ties to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and has defended the president’s false claim that tens of millions of “dead” people are receiving Social Security benefits. CNN reported earlier this week that as SSA combs “through its databases to check whether beneficiaries are alive or dead” at Trump and Musk’s behest, agency staffers are “seeing more people coming in to be resurrected” after being falsely deemed deceased. “I’ve been saying it all along,” former SSA chief Martin O’Malley wrote Thursday. “ Elon Musk is the biggest fraud, not Social Security.”
Trump’s State Department has intervened on behalf of Starlink in The Gambia and at least four other developing nations. This story was originally published by ProPublica . ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. In early February, Sharon Cromer, U.S. ambassador to Gambia, went to visit one of the country’s Cabinet ministers at his agency’s headquarters, above a partially abandoned strip mall off a dirt road. It had been two weeks since President Donald Trump took office, and Cromer had pressing business to discuss. She needed the minister to fall in line to help Elon Musk. Starlink, Musk’s satellite internet company, had spent months trying to secure regulatory approval to sell internet access in the impoverished West African country. As head of Gambia’s communications ministry, Lamin Jabbi oversees the government’s review of Starlink’s license application. Jabbi had been slow to sign off and the company had grown impatient. Now the top U.S. government official in Gambia was in Jabbi’s office to intervene. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency loomed over the conversation. The administration had already begun freezing foreign aid projects, and early in the meeting, Cromer, a Biden appointee, said something that rattled Gambian officials in the room. She listed the ways that the U.S. was supporting the country, according to two people present and contemporaneous notes, noting that key initiatives — like one that funds a $25 million project to improve the electrical system — were currently under review. Jabbi’s top deputy, Hassan Jallow, told ProPublica he saw Cromer’s message as a veiled threat: If Starlink doesn’t get its license, the U.S. could cut off the desperately needed funds. “The implication was that they were connected,” Jallow said. In recent months, senior State Department officials in both Washington and Gambia have coordinated with Starlink executives to coax, lobby and browbeat at least seven Gambian government ministers to help Musk, records and interviews show. One of those Cabinet officials told ProPublica his government is under “maximum pressure” to yield. In mid-March, Cromer escalated the campaign by writing to Gambia’s president with an “important request.” That day, a contentious D.C. meeting between Musk employees and Jabbi had ended in an impasse. She urged the president to circumvent Jabbi and “facilitate the necessary approvals for Starlink to commence operations,” according to a copy of the letter obtained by ProPublica . Jabbi told confidantes he felt the ambassador was trying to get him fired. The saga in Gambia is the starkest known example of the Trump administration wielding the U.S. government’s foreign policy apparatus to advance the business interests of Musk, a top Trump adviser and the world’s richest man. Since Trump’s inauguration, the State Department has intervened on behalf of Starlink in Gambia and at least four other developing nations, previously unreported records and interviews show. As the Trump administration has gutted foreign aid, U.S. diplomats have pressed governments to fast-track licenses for Starlink and arranged conversations between company employees and foreign leaders. In cables, U.S. officials have said that for their foreign counterparts, helping Starlink is a chance to prove their commitment to good relations with the U.S. In one country last month, the U.S. embassy bragged that Starlink’s license was approved despite concerns it wasn’t abiding by rules that its competitors had to follow. “If this was done by another country, we absolutely would call this corruption,” said Kristofer Harrison, who served as a high-level State Department official in the George W. Bush administration. “Because it is corruption.” Helping U.S. businesses has long been part of the State Department’s mission, but former ambassadors said they sought to do this by making the positive case for the benefits of U.S. investment. When seeking deals for U.S. companies, they said they took care to avoid the appearance of conflicts or leaving the impression that punitive measures were on the table. Ten current and former State Department officials said the recent drive was an alarming departure from standard diplomatic practice — because of both the tactics used and the person who would benefit most from them. “I honestly didn’t think we were capable of doing this,” one official told ProPublica . “That is bad on every level.” Kenneth Fairfax, a retired career diplomat who served as U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan, said the global push for Musk “could lead to the impression that the U.S. is engaging in a form of crony capitalism.” The Washington Post previously reported that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has instructed U.S. diplomats to help Starlink so it can beat its Chinese and Russian competitors. Multiple countries, including India, have sped up license approvals for Starlink to try to build goodwill in tariff negotiations with the Trump administration, the Post reported. ProPublica ’s reporting provides a detailed picture of what that push has looked like in practice. After Gambia’s ambassador to the U.S. declined an interview about Starlink — a topic seen as highly sensitive given Musk’s position — ProPublica reporters traveled to the capital, Banjul, to piece together the events. This account is based on internal State Department documents and interviews with dozens of current and former officials from both countries, most of whom requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. In response to detailed questions, the State Department issued a statement celebrating Starlink. “Starlink is an America-made product that has been a game changer in helping remote areas around the world gain internet connectivity,” a spokesperson wrote. “Any patriotic American should want to see an American company’s success on the global stage, especially over compromised Chinese competitors.” Cromer and Starlink did not respond to requests for comment, nor did the office of the president of Gambia. Jabbi made Jallow available to discuss the situation. During the Biden administration, State Department officials worked with Starlink to help the company navigate bureaucracies abroad. But the agency’s approach appears to have become significantly more aggressive and expansive since Trump’s return to power, according to internal records and current and former government officials. Foreign leaders are acutely aware of Musk’s unprecedented position in the government, which he has used to help rewrite U.S. foreign policy. After Musk spent at least $288 million on the 2024 election, Trump gave the billionaire a powerful post in the White House. In mere months, Musk’s team has directed the firing of thousands of federal workers, canceled billions of dollars in programs and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development, which supported humanitarian projects around the world. African nations have been particularly hard-hit by the cuts. At the same time, Musk continues to run Starlink and the rest of his corporate empire. In past administrations, government ethics lawyers carefully vetted potential conflicts of interest. Though Trump once said that “we won’t let him get near” conflicts, the White House has also suggested Musk is responsible for policing himself. The billionaire has waved away criticisms of the arrangement, saying “ I’ll recuse myself ” if conflicts arise. “My companies are suffering because I’m in the government,” Musk said. In a statement, the White House said Musk has nothing to do with deals involving Starlink and that every administration official follows ethical guidelines. “For the umpteenth time, President Trump will not tolerate any conflicts of interest,” spokesperson Harrison Fields said in an email. Executives at Starlink have seized the moment to expand. An April State Department cable to D.C. obtained by ProPublica quoted a Starlink employee describing the company’s approach to securing a license in Djibouti, a key U.S. ally in Africa that hosts an American military base: “We’re pushing from the top and the bottom to ram this through.” Musk entered the White House at a pivotal moment for Starlink. When the service launched in 2020, it had a novel approach to internet access. Rather than relying on underground cables or cell towers like traditional telecom companies, Starlink uses low-orbiting satellites that let it provide fast internet in places its competitors had struggled to reach. Expectations for the startup were sky high. Bullish Morgan Stanley analysts predicted that by 2040, Starlink would have up to 364 million subscribers worldwide — more than the current population of the U.S. Starlink quickly became a central pillar of Musk’s fortune. His stake in Starlink’s parent company, SpaceX, is estimated to be worth about $150 billion of his roughly $400 billion net worth. Although the company says its user base has grown to over 5 million people, it remains a bit player compared to the largest internet providers. And the satellite internet market is set to become more competitive as well-funded companies launch services modeled on Starlink. Jeff Bezos’ Project Kuiper, a unit of Amazon, has said it expects to start serving customers later this year. Satellite upstarts headquartered in Europe and China aren’t far behind either. “They want to get as far and as fast as they can before Amazon Kuiper gets online,” said Chris Quilty, a veteran space industry analyst. In internal cables, State Department officials have said they are eager to help Musk get ahead of foreign satellite companies. Securing licenses in the next 18 months is critical for Starlink due to the growing competition, one cable said last month. Senior diplomats have written that they hope to give Musk’s company a “first-mover advantage.” Africa represents a lucrative prize. Much of the continent lacks reliable internet. Success in Africa could mean dominating a market with the fastest-growing population on earth. As of last November, Starlink had reportedly launched in 15 of Africa’s 54 countries, but it was beginning to spark a backlash. Last year, Cameroon and Namibia cracked down on Musk’s company for allegedly operating in their countries illegally. In South Africa — where Starlink has so far failed to get a license — Musk exacerbated tensions by publicly accusing the government of anti-white racism. Since Trump won the election, at least five African countries have granted licenses to Starlink: the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho and Chad. Now Musk’s campaign of cuts has given him leverage inside the State Department. A Trump administration memo that leaked to the press last month proposed closing six embassies in Africa. The Gambian embassy was on the list of proposed cuts. An 8-year-old democracy, Gambia’s 2.7 million residents live on a sliver of land once used as a hub in the transatlantic slave trade. For two decades until 2017, the nation was ruled by a despot who had his opponents assassinated and plundered public funds to buy himself luxuries like a Rolls-Royce collection and a private zoo. When the dictator was ousted, the economy was in tatters. Today Gambia is one of the poorest countries in the world, with about half the country living on less than $4 a day. In this fragile environment, the telecom industry that Jabbi oversees is vitally important to Gambian authorities. According to the government, the sector provides at least 20% of the country’s tax revenue. Ads for the country’s multiple internet providers are ubiquitous, painted onto dozens of public works — parks, police booths, schools. It’s unclear why Starlink’s efforts in Gambia, a tiny market, have been so intense. Cromer’s efforts on behalf of the company started under the Biden administration, as she documented last December in a cable sent back to Washington. Last spring, Starlink began the process of securing necessary approvals from a local utilities regulator and the Gambian communications agency. The utilities regulator wanted Starlink to pay an $85,000 license fee, which the company felt was too expensive. Cromer spoke to local officials, who then “pressured” the regulator to remove “this unnecessary barrier to entry,” the ambassador wrote. Gambian supporters of Starlink felt that its product would be a boon for consumers and for economic growth in the country, where internet service remains unreliable and slow. “The ripple effects could be extraordinary,” Cromer said in the December cable, contending it could enable telehealth and improve education. Opponents argued that local internet providers were one of Gambia’s few stable sources of jobs and infrastructure investments. If Starlink killed off its competition and then jacked up its prices — in Nigeria, the company announced last year it would suddenly double its fees — authorities could have little leverage to manage the fallout. When Musk refused to turn on Starlink in part of Ukraine during the war there, it heightened concerns about handing control of internet access to the mercurial billionaire, industry analysts said. One Musk tweet about foreign regulators’ ability to police his company caught the attention of Gambian critics: “They can shake their fist at the sky,” Musk said in 2021. The ultimate authority for granting Starlink a license lies with Jabbi, an attorney who spent years in the local telecom sector. Gambian telecom companies that don’t want competition from Musk see Jabbi as an ally. Jallow, Jabbi’s top deputy, told ProPublica that the ministry is not opposed to Starlink operating in Gambia. But he said Jabbi is doing due diligence to ensure laws and regulations are being followed before opening up the country to a consequential change. After Trump’s inauguration, Jabbi’s position pitted him against not only Starlink but also the U.S. government. In the weeks after the February meeting where Cromer reminded Jabbi about the tenuous state of American funding to his country, the ambassador told other diplomats that getting Starlink approved was a high priority, according to a Western official familiar with her comments. The stance surprised some of Cromer’s peers. Cromer had spent her career at USAID before President Joe Biden appointed her as ambassador. Her tenure in Gambia often focused on human rights and democracy building. In March, when Jabbi and Jallow traveled to D.C. to attend a World Bank summit, the State Department helped arrange a series of meetings for them. The first, on March 19, was with Starlink representatives including Ben MacWilliams, a former U.S. diplomat who leads the company’s expansion efforts in Africa. The second was with U.S. government officials at the State Department’s headquarters. The meeting with the company quickly became contentious. Huddled in a conference room at the World Bank, MacWilliams accused Jabbi of standing in the way of his nation’s progress and harming ordinary Gambians, according to Jallow, who was in the meeting, and four others briefed on the event. “We want our license now,” Jallow recalled MacWilliams saying. “Why are you delaying it?” The conversation ended in a stalemate. In the hours that followed, Starlink and the U.S. government’s campaign intensified in a way that underscored the degree of coordination between the two parties. The company told Jabbi it would cancel his scheduled D.C. meeting with State Department officials because “there was no more need,” Jallow said. The State Department meeting never happened. Instead, 4,000 miles away in Gambia’s capital, Cromer would try an even more aggressive approach. That same day, Cromer had already met with Gambia’s equivalent of a commerce secretary to lobby him to help pave the way for Starlink. Then she was informed about the disappointing meeting Starlink had had in D.C., according to State Department records. By day’s end, Cromer had sent a letter to the nation’s president. “I am writing to seek your support to allow Starlink to operate in The Gambia,” the letter opened. Over three pages, the ambassador described her concerns about Jabbi’s agency and listed the ways that Gambians could benefit from Starlink. She also said the company had satisfied conditions set by Jabbi’s predecessor. “I respectfully urge you to facilitate the necessary approvals for Starlink to commence operations in The Gambia,” Cromer concluded. “I look forward to your favorable response.” In the weeks since, Jabbi has refused to budge. The U.S. government’s efforts have continued. In late April, Gambia’s attorney general met in D.C. with senior State Department officials, according to a person familiar with the matter, where they again discussed the Starlink issue. Diplomats were troubled by how the pressure campaign could hurt America’s image overseas. “This is not Iran or a rogue African state run by a dictator — this is a democracy, a natural ally,” said another senior Western diplomat in the region, noting that Gambia is “a prime partner of the West” in United Nations votes. “You beat up the smallest and the best boy in the class.” Gambia is not the only country being leaned on. Since Trump took office, embassies around the world have sent a flurry of cables to D.C. documenting their meetings with Starlink executives and their efforts to cajole developing countries into helping Musk’s business. The cables all describe a problem similar to what happened in Gambia: The company has struggled to win a license from local regulators. In some countries, ambassadors reported, their work appears to be yielding results. (The embassies and their host countries did not respond to requests for comment.) The U.S. embassy in Cameroon wrote that the country could prove its commitment to Trump’s agenda by letting Starlink expand its presence there. In the same missive, embassy officials discussed the impact of U.S. aid cuts and deportations and cited a humanitarian official who was reckoning with America’s shifting foreign policy: “They may not be happy with what they see, but they are trying to adapt as best they can.” In Lesotho, where embassy officials had spent weeks trying to help Starlink get a license, the company finalized a deal after Trump imposed 50% tariffs on the tiny landlocked country. Lesotho officials told embassy staff they hoped the license would help in their urgent push to reduce the levies, according to Mother Jones . A major multinational company complained that Starlink was getting preferential treatment, embassy documents obtained by ProPublica show, since Musk’s firm had been exempted from requirements its competitors still had to follow. In cables sent from the U.S. embassy in Djibouti this spring, State Department officials recounted their meetings with the company and pledged to continue working with “Starlink in identifying government officials and facilitating discussions.” In Bangladesh, U.S. diplomats pressed Starlink’s case “early and often” with local officials, partnered with Starlink to “build an educational strategy” for their counterparts and helped arrange a conversation between Musk and the nation’s head of state, according to a recent cable. The embassy’s work started under Biden but bore fruit only after Trump took office. Their efforts resulted in Bangladesh approving Starlink’s request to do business in the country, the top U.S. diplomat there said last month, a sign-off that Musk’s company had sought for years.

Trump’s escalation of censorship and retaliation is terrifying. The groundwork for it was prepared years in advance. “It’s a chilling feeling,” Tariq explains to me. “Here at Yale, immigration authorities have revoked at least four students’ visas so far.” Tariq Khan is an interdisciplinary historian and lecturer at Yale University. “A lot of students are scared,” he explains. “I have international students in my classes. They’re really worried that their visas might be revoked. The Trump administration’s strategy has been to create uncertainty and fear. They want to traumatize people and put people in a state of anxiety.” Tariq has lost his own job due to budgeting uncertainty provoked by the Trump administration’s funding cuts , but has been hired temporarily in another department for the next academic year. “I teach exactly the things the MAGA far right doesn’t want, relating to race and class and gender.” Trump has sent ultimatums to Columbia and Harvard; Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is revoking visas and hunting down students for protesting genocide; and Elon Musk’s DOGE team has created lists of prohibited words that federal agencies and funding recipients are forced to abide by. As sudden as the onslaught may feel, the right has been developing these tactics and infrastructures over the last two decades, creating the necessary balance to coordinate between neo-Nazis in the streets, far right trolls on the internet, tech billionaires and conservative policymakers. In 2005, Yale University denied tenure to David Graeber , a renowned anthropologist as well as a widely read anarchist author who would go on to help organize Occupy Wall Street. He and others allege the decision was politically motivated . Despite a stellar academic record, he was unable to find further employment with any American university. In 2007, right-wing activist Alan Dershowitz spearheaded a smear campaign to block Norman Finkelstein from receiving tenure at DePaul University. Dershowitz was a Harvard law professor who would go on to defend Trump, Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein. Finkelstein, the target of the smear campaign, is the son of Holocaust survivors and a fierce critic of Israeli apartheid . His department voted overwhelmingly in favor of his tenure, but university leadership blocked it. They did the same to Mehrene Larudee , another Jewish professor critical of the Israeli occupation. In 2014, the respected Palestinian American scholar Steven Salaita had his professorship abruptly cancelled by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) following pressure from “major donors.” He subsequently found himself unemployable by any university in the U.S. Salaita — who is best known for his books on anti-Arab racism and on similarities between Palestinian and Native American experiences — warned at the time that “the University’s decision has farther reaching implications.” His words proved prophetic. The far right became emboldened during the first Trump administration. In 2018, at the University of Illinois, an “alt-right” group stepped up their censorship campaign so much that faculty members compared them to an occupying army . Tariq Khan, then a grad student at UIUC, was forced to leave his studies and his job after a racist and Islamophobic harassment campaign culminated with right-wingers showing up outside his house and threatening his family, including his three young children. The full dimensions of the right-wing onslaught, however, cannot be perceived if we focus solely on the universities or any other institution. The right is pursuing an aggressive reorganization of our society, and that requires not only a change in discourse but also an accelerated capacity for action in pursuit of their agenda. The right-wingers are not satisfied with mainstreaming racism and anti-immigrant bigotry and pushing the Democrats into increasingly extreme pro-deportation stances . They realized that more dramatic repression was necessary to achieve their goal, given the fact that spontaneous popular uprisings can block the ability of the government to deport people, as occurred in 2017 . And since 2016, when the risk-taking and organizing of anarchists and other antifascists stopped the neo-Nazi rampage in Charlottesville , right-wingers have mostly been losing in the streets. In order to exert the kind of power they crave, they would need to move porously between institutions and outside of them, to capture institutions or destroy them. How could they build up a capacity for coordination without any clear game plan, with little centralization or unity across the right, and with a Republican Party characterized only by opportunism and obsequiousness? Eventually, the right’s critical victories came in the virtual space of social media, a toxic terrain that advantages alienation over solidarity, where tech billionaires enjoy an almost absolute power to shape the landscape and federal prosecutors have substantial latitude to punish or censor those they deem enemies of the state . Even on the left, few will acknowledge that the ability to coordinate punitive action between government and extrajudicial forces in pursuit of a conservative agenda emerged in campaigns of repression against autonomous sex workers. To better understand how the criminalization of sex workers was a key part of the right-wing drive to violently reorganize society, I reach out to Red, an organizer with The Support Ho(s)e Collective , a countrywide collective that organizes support “for all sex workers through political education and public agitation.” Our conversation begins with a shared understanding that the internet offered an important space for many sex workers — a space that enabled workers to screen clients and share information about those who had acted harmfully or disrespectfully in the past, and also a space that created many more opportunities for sex workers to work without bosses, allowing them to keep all or most of their money. In describing the online repression that sex workers have faced in the past two decades, Red enumerates the raids, prosecutions and policy changes that occurred in 2008, 2010, 2014 and 2015, each time leading to the loss of access to a site that enabled sex workers to find some measure of safety, community and autonomy. Things got significantly worse in 2018, the year SESTA/FOSTA was updated into a single law to ramp up prosecution and persecution of sex workers . Conflating sex work with sex trafficking, SESTA/FOSTA was supported by Republicans and many Democrats , including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, and the law was justified with much of the same rhetoric being used to target trans women today: politicians and pundits said it was needed to protect women and to protect children. “Sex workers have always been at the forefront of social and liberation movements,” Red tells me. “However, our movements toward decrim, harm reduction, unionization and anti-stigma campaigns often go unsupported by the broader Left.” Specifically, Red calls out “carceral feminists” (including trans-exclusionary radical feminists and sex worker-exclusionary radical feminists) “who were willing to dox us, call cops on us, out us in community organizing meetings, raise money for law enforcement exit programs. … It felt like a soul-killing.” Similarly, there were failures on the left to mobilize in protection of those most targeted when the far right pushed some of the most visible anarchists and other antifascists off social media. A site administrator for the anarchist news site It’s Going Down was part of the anarchist media community that was targeted by a broad spectrum of right-wing forces, from far right trolls like Andy Ngo to tech billionaires like Elon Musk. The site administrator, who asked to be identified by the pseudonym of Tom to protect himself against retaliation from both far right paramilitaries and Justice Department subpoenas, tells me: “We had over 100,000 subscribers” in 2020. He adds that CrimethInc , another anarchist news site, “had similar numbers.” He said taken together, the two sites had “higher degrees of engagement and reach than other accounts of our size.” In 2020, It’s Going Down and CrimethInc were the largest anarchist sites on Facebook and Twitter and were serving as important bulwarks against accelerating fascist discourses on the web. “The difference between mainstream media and us is that we would say things that were more militant, more radical, but we were both doing reporting and commentary,” Tom told me. “We’re writing cited articles, putting out podcasts, interviewing people from all over the world.” Social media companies were facing a public image crisis with the unchecked spread of misinformation by the far right. In response, Facebook decided to equate fascists and antifascists by spinning the situation as a question of “balance.” Facebook leadership brought in Joel Kaplan , then their vice president of Global Public Policy. Tom notes that Kaplan “came from the rightwing think tank world in DC.” At Facebook, he made a name for himself by fighting to allow racist content and the mass dissemination of fake news , since banning such content would disproportionately hurt conservatives. “When Facebook was under a bunch of pressure to ban the militias and Proud Boy groups, Kaplan made the argument that they needed to ban us and CrimethInc under the pretense that we were also armed groups, when we are actually publishing collectives” Tom explains. In 2022, Elon Musk acquired Twitter (now known as X) and immediately reinstated tens of thousands of fascist and white supremacist accounts while banning CrimethInc , It’s Going Down and other antifascist accounts like the John Brown Gun Club. Musk branded himself a “free speech absolutist,” and mainstream media like The New York Times helped spread this inaccurate moniker . According to Tom, mainstream media at the time were still taking Musk at face value, but “in radical tech and hacker circles the narrative was that Musk had bought Twitter to shape political discourse in the same way that the Hearsts used newspapers in the early 20 th century.” He adds: “What Musk does is curating content so that certain types of things surface. Getting rid of us was part of that.” Social justice-oriented media sites like Truthout and The Intercept reported with alarm about the purging of the anarchist sites, as did some corporate media . Indeed, many professional journalists “got furious about it,” noting that “the idea that we would face retaliation for doing media was a violation of basic journalistic principles,” Tom says. However, without a strong movement in the streets, reporting on censorship wasn’t enough to stop the purging of these anarchist news sites. Facebook and X quickly became megaphones and recruitment centers for the most harmful far right ideologies. Moderators stood back as far right accounts grew larger and larger, making death threats, celebrating acts of genocide, spreading misinformation and coordinating campaigns of censorship. More recent assaults by the far right have shown greater agility and mobilizing power than its past efforts — these days, the right is acting quickly to simultaneously censor critics, capture or silence institutions of power, spread oppressive ideologies and enable real world harm. The right’s campaigns against the professors Lara Sheehi and Rupa Marya are illustrative. In both cases, a smattering of right-wing online accounts and well-funded pressure groups generated a spectacle of outrage and controversy, accusing the professors of discrimination and antisemitism. Then corporate media outlets and politicians disseminated the accusations further. People on the right treated the accusations as fact, and people in the liberal center treated them as credible allegations, despite an absence of evidence or thorough reports debunking the accusations . Universities have colluded with these campaigns either by taking disciplinary action against the person being targeted, or by failing to protect their employees from harassment and slander, and giving “ legitimacy to prejudicial, frivolous, and defamatory claims. ” Lara Sheehi is a queer Lebanese Arab scholar as well as a decolonial and trans-affirming clinical psychologist . In the fall of 2022, she was a professor at George Washington University (GWU) when a student made a claim of antisemitism against her. She was “cleared by her program and the dean,” but that was only the beginning. She describes to me how she has been subjected to “a massive right-wing smear campaign, with racist hate mail, death threats, threats of bodily harm, sexual assault and deportation” and celebrations of genocide sent to her address, personal and public emails, and social media accounts. “Things reached a fever pitch when Fox News picked up the story, publishing a hit piece on me pairing my face with Islamic Jihad,” Sheehi says. “Every time a hit piece like this was published, there would be an uptick in hate mail.” After over a year of intense harassment that resulted in stalking, the cancellation of multiple speaking events, and police interrogations when coming back from international travel, she left the university. In January 2025, the Department of Education exonerated Sheehi of any discriminatory acts, but the campaign of censorship and retaliation — a campaign in support of Israel’s ongoing genocide — had already won. Rupa Marya, an anticolonial author and professor of medicine, was targeted after raising a question of medical ethics: should medical schools admit possible war criminals with no vetting? In September 2024, UCSF suspended her after a lengthy campaign of harassment, and she now faces possible job loss. Multiple other nurses and physicians at UCSF have been suspended or prevented from giving lectures after mentioning the ongoing genocide in Gaza, which includes the deliberate targeting of Palestinian health care workers and hospitals . Incidentally, the University of California’s top donor is the right-wing Helen Diller Family Foundation ; the Diller family owns a major real estate company responsible for gentrifying San Francisco and supports illegal Israeli settlements that commit ethnic cleansing against Palestinians. What Rupa describes is systematic censorship and complicity across the medical profession: White people are using Title VI protection to silence people of color speaking out against a genocide. Physicians have abdicated their professional moral duties and ethical responsibilities to give cover for the most egregious expressions of racism. They state I’m ‘unprofessional’ and unable to tolerate a difference of opinion. When it comes to genocide, to physicians being tortured and children being burned alive in hospital beds with the support of our taxes, they are right. Politicians like Scott Wiener , organizations like Canary Mission that spread dossiers targeting activists (oftentimes with distorted facts) to mobilize right-wing trolls, propaganda organizations funded by the Israeli government like StandWithUs , and a dense web of investment and endowments force institutions putatively centered on education and on health care into complicity in genocide . When those institutions and the media treat spurious accusations as potentially credible, they help push the Overton Window to the right. Simultaneously, movements that try to build the kind of collective power capable of creating an effective change are repressed. GWU “falsely accused” Palestinian students and supporters “of committing crimes,” subjected them to disproportionate investigations by campus police and subjected them to “months-long disciplinary processes for infractions” they had not committed, according to a complaint filed by Palestine Legal . Sam — a student from Indiana University, who also asked to be given a pseudonym for this article — describes to me the coordinated repression of the pro-Palestine encampments of 2024: Right-wing Zionist groups doxxed student participants; new laws and policies restricted the right to assemble and protest; counterprotesters shouted insults, blasted loud music and interrupted a Shabbat ceremony; and on two occasions in April 2024 “militarized state troopers in riot gear took down the encampments, maced students and arrested 56 protesters, including students, faculty and community members,” Sam recalls. We can see the same pattern of complicity between police and paramilitaries across the country. In January 2024 at Columbia, counterprotesters (allegedly including former IDF soldiers) attacked a solidarity encampment with noxious chemicals, hospitalizing eight students . The same counterprotesters showed up to cheer on city police as they evicted the encampment and arrested around a hundred students in April, and the university administration participated in the repression by suspending two anti-occupation groups, Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace. At UCLA on April 30, 2024, a Zionist mob attacked a pro-Palestine encampment, beating people with poles and spraying them with bear mace, injuring 150 and sending at least 25 to the emergency room . All the while, police stood by and watched. Two days later, cops attacked the protest with rubber bullets , arresting 110 people and evicting the encampment. Though the use of this machinery of repression is currently particularly glaring in the crackdown against the movement against the genocide in Gaza, the right is also using this same machinery to attack trans people, immigrants, pregnant people, Black people, anti-capitalists and anti-fascists. The far right went through a long process of trial and error to build up the power necessary to aggressively reshape U.S. society. When right-wing forces were unable to effectively mobilize in the streets due to fierce resistance, the internet — and social media in particular — became their staging ground. Their dominance was aided by right-wing tech billionaires like Elon Musk and right-wing policymakers like Joel Kaplan, and ensured by the opportunism and acquiescence of unscrupulous tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos . “Every capitulation and act of appeasement only emboldens them more,” Tariq Khan concludes. “The only thing that will stop them is resistance.”
Christopher Young earns up to $1 million annually as he guts the agency that regulates two of Musk’s biggest companies. This story was originally published by ProPublica. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. One of Elon Musk’s employees is earning between $100,001 and $1 million annually as a political adviser to his billionaire boss while simultaneously helping to dismantle the federal agency that regulates two of Musk’s biggest companies, according to court records and a financial disclosure report obtained by ProPublica . Ethics experts said Christopher Young’s dual role — working for a Musk company as well as the Department of Government Efficiency — likely violates federal conflict-of-interest regulations. Musk has publicly called for the elimination of the agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing that it is “duplicative.’’ Government ethics rules bar employees from doing anything that “ would cause a reasonable person to question their impartiality ” and are designed to prevent even the appearance of using public office for private gain. Court records show Young, who works for a Musk company called Europa 100 LLC, was involved in the Trump administration’s efforts to unwind the consumer agency’s operations and fire most of its staff in early February. Young’s arrangement raises questions of where his loyalty lies, experts said. The dynamic is especially concerning, they said, given that the CFPB — which regulates companies that provide financial services — has jurisdiction over Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, which makes auto loans, and his social media site, X, which announced in January that it was partnering with Visa on mobile payments. The world’s richest man has in turn made no secret of his desire to do away with the bureau, posting just weeks after Donald Trump’s election victory, “ Delete CFPB. There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies .” “Musk clearly has a conflict of interest and should recuse,” said Claire Finkelstein, who directs the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law at the University of Pennsylvania. “And therefore an employee of his, who is answerable to him on the personal side, outside of government, and who stands to keep his job only if he supports Musk’s personal interests, should not be working for DOGE.” Young, a 36-year-old Republican consultant, has been active in political circles for years, most recently serving as the campaign treasurer of Musk’s political action committee, helping the tech titan spend more than a quarter billion dollars to help elect Trump. Before joining Musk’s payroll, he worked as a vice president for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade association representing the pharmaceutical industry’s interests, his disclosure shows. He also worked as a field organizer for the Republican National Committee and for former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the New York Times reported . Young was appointed a special governmental employee in the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on Jan. 30 and dispatched to work in the CFPB in early February, according to court records and his disclosure form. Someone with his position could be making as much as $190,000 a year in government salary, documents obtained by Bloomberg show. At the same time, Young collects a salary as an employee of Musk’s Texas-based Europa 100 LLC, where, according to his disclosure report , his duties are to “advise political and public policy.” Beyond that description, it’s not clear what, exactly, Young does at Europa 100 or what the company’s activities are. It was created in July 2020 by Jared Birchall, a former banker who runs Musk’s family office, Excession LLC, according to state records. The company has been used to pay nannies to at least some of Musk’s children, according to a 2023 tabloid report , and, along with two other Musk entities, to facilitate tens of millions of dollars in campaign transactions, campaign finance reports show . As a special government employee, Young can maintain outside employment while serving for a limited amount of time. But such government workers are still required to abide by laws and rules governing conflicts of interest and personal and business relationships. Cynthia Brown, the senior ethics counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which has sued the administration to produce a range of public records documenting DOGE’s activities, said that Young’s government work appears to benefit his private sector employer. “Which hat are you wearing while you’re serving the American people? Are you doing it for the interests of your outside job?” she asked. In addition to his role at Europa 100, Young reported other ties to Musk’s private businesses. He affirmed in his disclosure form that he will “continue to participate” in a “defined contribution plan” sponsored by Excession, the Musk home office, and that he has served since February as a “vice president” of United States of America Inc., another Musk entity organized by Birchall, where he also advises on “political and public policy,” the records show. While he lists the latter among “sources of compensation exceeding $5,000 in a year,” the exact figure is not disclosed. Young did not return a call and emails seeking comment. The CFPB, DOGE and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. Musk didn’t respond to an email seeking comment, and Birchall didn’t return a call left at a number he lists in public formation records. A lawyer who helped form United States of America Inc. hung up when reached for comment and hasn’t responded to a subsequent message. Asked about how his business interests and government work may intersect, Musk said in a February interview that, “ I’ll recuse myself if it is a conflict. ” The revelation of Young’s apparent violation of federal standards of conduct follows a series of ProPublica stories documenting how another DOGE aide helped carry out the administration’s attempts to implement mass layoffs at the CFPB while holding as much as $715,000 in stock that bureau employees are prohibited from owning — actions one expert called a “ pretty clear-cut violation ” of the federal criminal conflict-of-interest statute. The White House has defended the aide, saying he “did not even manage” the layoffs, “making this entire narrative an outright lie.” A spokesperson also said the aide had until May 8 to divest, though it isn’t clear whether he did and the White House hasn’t answered questions about that. “These allegations are another attempt to diminish DOGE’s critical mission,” the White House said. Following ProPublica ’s reporting, the aide’s work at the CFPB ended . On Monday, a group of 10 good government and consumer advocacy groups, citing ProPublica ’s coverage, sent a letter to the acting inspector general of the CFPB , asking him to “swiftly investigate these clear conflicts of interest violations of Trump Administration officials acting in their own personal financial interest.” ProPublica has identified nearly 90 officials assigned to DOGE , though it’s unclear how many, if any, have potential conflicts. Government agencies have been slow to release financial disclosure forms. But Finkelstein said the cases reported by ProPublica call into question the motivation behind DOGE’s efforts to undo the consumer watchdog agency. “It matters because it means that the officials who work for the government, who are supposed to be dedicated to the interests of the American people, are not necessarily focused on the good of the country but instead may be focused on the good of themselves, self enrichment, or trying to please their boss by focusing on enriching their bosses and growing their portfolios,” she said. Unionized CFPB workers have sued the CFPB’s acting director, Russell Vought, to stop his attempts to drastically scale down the bureau’s staff and its operations. Since taking office, the Trump administration has twice attempted to fire nearly all of the agency’s employees, tried canceling nearly all of its contracts and instituted stop-work mandates that have stifled virtually all agency work , including investigations into companies, ProPublica previously reported. The parties will appear before an appeals court this Friday for oral arguments in a case that will determine just how deeply Vought can cut the agency while still ensuring that it carries out dozens of mandates Congress tasked it with when lawmakers established the bureau in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The court records produced in the litigation offer a window into the role Young played in gutting the CFPB during the administration’s first attempt to unwind the bureau beginning in early February. He was dispatched to the CFPB’s headquarters on Feb. 6, just two days after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, then the agency’s acting director, told the staff and contractors to stop working . The following day, Young and other DOGE aides were given access to nonclassified CFPB systems, court records show. That same day, Musk posted “CFPB RIP” with a gravestone emoji. On Feb. 11 and 12, Young was included on emails with top agency officials. One of those messages discussed the cancellation of more than 100 contracts , an act that a contracting officer described in a sworn affidavit as including “all contracts related to enforcement, supervision, external affairs, and consumer response.” Another message involved how to transfer to the Treasury Department some of the more than $3 billion in civil penalties that the bureau has collected from companies to settle consumer protection cases , a move that could deny harmed consumers compensation. A third discussed the terms of an agreement that would allow for the mass layoff of staffers , court records show. In his financial disclosure form , which he signed on Feb. 15, Young listed his employment by Musk’s Europa 100 as active, beginning in August 2024 through the “present.” Then, in early March, as the legal fight over the administration’s cuts played out before a federal judge, Young sent the CFPB’s chief operating officer a message about forthcoming firings, known as a “reduction in force,” or RIF, in government parlance. In the email, he asked whether officials were “prepared to implement the RIF” if the judge lifted a temporary stay, according to a March district court opinion that has for the moment stopped most of the administration’s proposed cuts. In addition to his employment, Young’s disclosure presents another potential conflict. He also lists owning as much as $15,000 in Amazon stock, a company that is on the bureau’s “Prohibited Holdings” list. Agency employees are forbidden from having such investments, and ethics experts have said that participating in an agency action that could boost the stock’s value — such as stripping the CFPB of its staff — constitutes a violation of the criminal conflict-of-interest statute. Young hasn’t responded to questions about that either.
Trump is using the baseless claim of “white genocide” promoted by the likes of Elon Musk to grant asylum to Afrikaners. Standing at the Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C. on Monday, Trump administration officials welcomed 59 white South Africans to their new home in the United States. “We respect what you had to deal with these last few years,” Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau told a small crowd. “We’re excited to welcome you here to our country where we think you will bloom.” On February 7, just 18 days after indefinitely closing United States borders to the world’s refugees, Donald Trump announced one exception. Afrikaners — white South Africans descended predominately from Dutch settlers — can now seek asylum in the U.S., while refugees fleeing war and persecution in places like Congo and Afghanistan will be turned away. Adding insult to injury, The Lever reported last week that the Trump administration plans to use federal funds typically reserved for elderly and at-risk refugee populations to resettle as many as 1,000 Afrikaners this year. The first group of Afrikaners arrived today, many of them waving small U.S. flags. Trump’s executive order prioritizing South Africans under the refugee program is likely due in part to his close relationship with Elon Musk. The billionaire SpaceX CEO grew up in a wealthy family in apartheid-era South Africa and has publicly claimed that white South Africans are persecuted for their race. Peter Thiel, another one of Trump’s far right billionaire backers, also spent years in apartheid South Africa and has praised that system. But Trump’s fixation on Afrikaners runs deeper than his political allyships: For years, Trump has indirectly platformed the “white genocide” conspiracies of South Africa’s far right. That rhetoric — recently manifested in concrete policies and actions — lays bare the white nationalism at the heart of Trump’s agenda. Railing against the South African government’s supposed racial discrimination against its white minority population, Trump’s February 7 executive order also included a freeze on all aid to South Africa. At the center of the executive order’s ire is a land reform law, the Expropriation Act of 2024, signed by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in January. Despite making up just 8 percent of the population, white South Africans own more than 70 percent of the country’s farmland; conversely, Black South Africans, who comprise 81 percent of the population, own less than 5 percent of agricultural land. The Expropriation Act aims to rectify South Africa’s legacy of apartheid and colonization by offering the government a way to seize private lands when it’s in the public’s interest, and for public purposes. Though Trump has tried to treat South Africa’s law as an anomaly driven by racism, we have this legal option in the United States, too — it’s called eminent domain. Where South Africa’s Expropriation Act differs is that, in some cases, it allows the government to not compensate landowners whose property is seized. Afrikaner groups pushing back against the law neglect to highlight that the massive discrepancy in South African land ownership is born from centuries of colonization — including a 1913 law that restricted Black South Africans from buying land and limited overall Black land ownership to just 7 percent. Trump’s characterization of the law as racial discrimination purposefully ignores this history, and goes so far as to claim that an attempt at restitution for apartheid amounts to a human rights violation. Of course, Trump’s purported moral commitment to safeguarding human rights has failed to be displayed in the cases of its closest allies — including permitting and facilitating Israel’s genocide in Gaza, for one. In a cruel inversion, Trump’s executive order actually attacks the South African government for its 2023 case “accusing Israel, not Hamas, of genocide in the International Court of Justice.” Part of that case’s symbolic power lay in the fact that South Africa — a country that long served as an international model for oppressive apartheid regimes — had chosen to bring it. The United Nations’ International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled last year it was “ plausible ” that Israel was committing a genocide in Gaza under the UN Genocide Convention and ordered the country to “take all measures within its power” to stop it. But that ruling did not deter Israel from its genocidal assault, nor did it stymie the U.S.’s flow of military aid. Instead, Trump has turned his focus to a different genocide — one that does not exist. Fringe panic about a “white genocide” in South Africa gained mainstream prevalence during Trump’s first presidency, when right-wing groups pushed the lie that a string of murders on commercial farms was disproportionately targeting white South Africans. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson helped sensationalize these claims at the time, boosting stories about South African farm attacks alongside inflammatory rhetoric about undocumented immigration in the U.S. and a domestic “ fertility crisis .” As many analysts pointed out, Carlson’s favored talking points echoed the “great replacement theory,” the white supremacist myth that white U.S. citizens are being systemically erased by people of color. For years, AfriForum — an Afrikaner advocacy organization characterized as a white supremacist group by the Southern Policy Law Center — tried to lobby the international community to elicit support for its “white genocide” claims. Its executives found sympathetic ears during Trump’s first administration, meeting with his then-national security adviser John Bolton and Sen. Ted Cruz’s staff in 2018. That August, Trump tweeted that he had instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to “closely study the South African land farm seizures and expropriations and large scale killing of farmers.” But the “massive human rights violation” that the president has been so keen to highlight is a baseless conspiracy theory. This February, a South African court dismissed claims of a white genocide as “clearly imagined” and blocked a $2.1 million donation to white supremacist group Boerelegioen. From 2016 to 2017, the year that attacks on white farmers began gathering more attention internationally, 74 people across all races were killed on South African farms — a tiny fraction of the more than 19,000 homicides that occurred in the country overall. Musk himself claimed in 2023 that South African political leaders “are openly pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa.” And on May 12, Trump told reporters he’d chosen to allow Afrikaners to seek asylum in the U.S. because of the “genocide that’s taking place” in South Africa. The president’s platforming of this lie has dangerous consequences. Take the 2022 shooting in Buffalo, New York, for instance, in which a gunman murdered 10 mostly Black people at a supermarket and cited the great replacement theory in his manifesto. Trump’s violent anti-immigrant policies stem from the same belief: that nonwhite people pose an existential threat to white populations and the U.S. national identity. In order to adequately grapple with the stakes of Trump’s disparate treatment of global refugees, we must look beyond Elon Musk and see this moment for what it is: The president is weaponizing the asylum process to further fuel racial division and entrench a white nationalist vision for the United States — in the name of “human rights,” no less.
A federal judge in California temporarily blocked the Department of Government Efficiency’s bureaucratic overhaul. A federal judge in California on Friday temporarily blocked what at coalition of labor unions, local governments, and nonprofits argued was “the unconstitutional dismantling of the federal government by the president of the United States on a scale unprecedented in this country’s history and in clear excess of his authority.” Since returning to office in January, U.S. President Donald Trump — aided by his so-callled Department of Government Efficiency and its de facto leader, billionaire Elon Musk — has worked to quickly overhaul the bureaucracy, even though “the president does not possess authority to reorganize, downsize, or otherwise transform the agencies of the federal government, unless and until Congress authorizes such action,” as the coalition’s complaint notes. District Judge Susan Illston agreed with the groups and governments, which include the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Alliance for Retired Americans, Main Street Alliance, Natural Resources Defense Council, the city and county of San Francisco, Chicago, Baltimore, and more. “The president has the authority to seek changes to executive branch agencies, but he must do so in lawful ways and, in the case of large-scale reorganizations, with the cooperation of the legislative branch,” wrote Illston in a 42-page decision. “Many presidents have sought this cooperation before; many iterations of Congress have provided it. Nothing prevents the president from requesting this cooperation — as he did in his prior term of office.” “Indeed, the court holds the president likely must request congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks, and thus issues a temporary restraining order to pause large-scale reductions in force in the meantime,” said the judge, appointed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by former President Bill Clinton. Illston added that “a temporary restraining order is, by definition, temporary. The court will not consider defendants’ request for a stay of execution of the temporary restraining order, as doing so would render the exercise pointless. The court must promptly proceed to consideration of a preliminary injunction.” Welcoming the development in a late Friday statement, the plaintiff coalition said that “the Trump administration’s unlawful attempt to reorganize the federal government has thrown agencies into chaos, disrupting critical services provided across our nation.” “Each of us represents communities deeply invested in the efficiency of the federal government — laying off federal employees and reorganizing government functions haphazardly does not achieve that,” the coalition added. “We are gratified by the court’s decision today to pause these harmful actions while our case proceeds.” The “largest and most significant challenge to Trump’s authority to remake the government without congressional approval,” as the coalition called it , was filed April 28 by the organizations’ legal team: Democracy Forward, Altshuler Berzon LLP, Protect Democracy, Public Rights Project, and State Democracy Defenders Fund. Illston’s decision came just hours after an emergency hearing, during which coalition attorney Danielle Leonard “said the Trump administration’s vision was to fundamentally degrade the services that Congress funds agencies to carry out, raising a profound separation of powers conflict,” according to The New York Times . As the newspaper detailed: “There’s a presumption of regularity that used to exist with respect to the government’s actions that I think they need to re-earn,” she said. Ms. Leonard said the Trump administration has never been able to point to any specific authority through which the president could seize that power from Congress. And she said that the government has consistently offered competing and contradictory explanations of why Mr. Trump can authorize the massive restructuring without Congress. “It’s an ouroboros: the snake eating its tail,” she said. Signaling a desire to keep moving through the process swiftly, Illston gave the plaintiff coalition until next Wednesday to file a motion for a preliminary injunction, and the federal defendants — Trump along with various federal agencies and their leaders — until the following Monday to respond, with a limit of 25 pages for both. Even if the coalition’s lawsuit ultimately succeeds, Republicans have a narrow majority in both chambers of Congress, meaning Trump could potentially work with lawmakers to pursue a similar gutting of the federal government before the midterm elections.
Legislation would embolden corporations and powerful individuals to use retaliatory lawsuits to silence their critics. Legislation would embolden corporations and powerful individuals to use retaliatory lawsuits to silence their critics. This article was originally published by The Lever , an investigative newsroom. If you like this story, sign up for The Lever ’s free newsletter . Texas is considering a sweeping set of legislative changes that would erode First Amendment protections, emboldening corporations and powerful individuals to use retaliatory lawsuits to silence their critics. If passed, the bills could unleash a torrent of defamation attacks against journalists and citizens at a time when major businesses, including major Silicon Valley tech giants, are flocking to the state for its business-friendly regulatory and tax environment. A shadowy cohort of high-net-worth individuals and fossil fuel interests is funding the lobbying groups pushing for these reforms, along with billionaire newcomers to the state like Elon Musk. If the lobbying campaign is successful, similar reforms could sweep across the country as states compete in a race to the bottom to attract businesses. Yet rolling back constitutional protections at the behest of corporate interests has faced enormous populist opposition, and even within a deep red state, it is dividing the Republican Party. A grassroots coalition of conservatives, wary of free speech being auctioned off to the highest bidder, have made unlikely allies with liberal nonprofits and media outlets that are equally threatened by the receding legal protections. It’s become a proxy battle for a much larger civil war playing out nationwide in the Trump era between the Republican Party’s tech-aligned faction trying to expand corporate power and the right’s populist wing fighting to rein it in. “The reality is wealthy people don’t need , it’s the little guy who needs them, and it doesn’t matter if you’re left or right,” said Tony McDonald, a lawyer and GOP political insider in Texas who’s represented clients facing SLAPP retaliation. A Musk-backed attempt to erode civil liberties in Texas is particularly alarming to First Amendment lawyers as the Trump administration tries to silence its own critics across civil society with the full force of the federal government. The Texas bills would expand the legal terrain for Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPP), a type of legal intimidation, most commonly involving claims of defamation, used by business interests against those who’ve spoken out against them. SLAPP suits have been deployed by landlords to scare tenants from speaking out against them at city council meetings; by businesses against negative Yelp reviews ; and by corporate tycoons against journalists and media personalities such as John Oliver . These cases are usually not meant to win a verdict in court but rather to bully the defendant and inflict monetary damage. Texas is currently one of 35 states where residents have more robust legal protections to ward off these cases. Passed in 2011 , the Texas Citizen Participation Act (TCPA) allows targets of retaliatory defamation lawsuits to quickly and easily file motions to dismiss the efforts before being dragged through court. The goal of these anti-SLAPP laws is to provide a legal bulwark against the onslaught of SLAPP intimidation lawsuits, which have become common with the rise of the internet and online forums that provide more venues for potential lawsuits. Texas passed its law after a number of high-profile SLAPP cases. One involved author Carla Main, who wrote a nonfiction book in 2007 about the abuse of eminent domain by real estate developers, covering several incidents in Freeport, Texas. In 2008, a developer whose practices were scrutinized in the book sued Main, her publisher, a newspaper that reviewed the book, and a law professor who wrote a blurb on the back jacket. Main ultimately prevailed in the case on appeal, with all the disputed claims found to be factual. But it took over three years of litigation and significant financial costs. The judge who initially ruled in favor of the developer was in the middle of his own SLAPP lawsuit, yet he didn’t recuse himself from the case. The judge was later pushed off the bench for unrelated improper behavior. The controversy around Main’s case became a catalyst for reform, and her testimony at one of the state legislature’s hearings in 2011 helped pave the way for passing the Texas Citizen Participation Act, even though it was too late to help her own case. “If an Anti-SLAPP motion had been available to Carla, she could have filed a dismissal under TCPA and avoided this whole drawn-out ordeal,” said Arif Panju, an Austin-based attorney at public interest group Institute for Justice, which represented Main in her case at the time. Now, the bills making their way through the Texas legislature threaten to gut the law by stripping away key provisions that dissuade SLAPP abuse. One bill would bar judges in SLAPP lawsuits from pausing the suit while a motion to dismiss makes its way through the court process. That would mean that defendants fighting to dismiss these cases could have to fight two lawsuits at once: the potential appeal of their motion and the ongoing initial lawsuit. “People just won’t appeal because they can’t afford to fight two separate cases at once and take the risk,” said Laura Prather, a First Amendment attorney at Haynes Boone in Texas. leading the fight against the new legislation. Prather helped get the state’s anti-SLAPP law passed in 2011. The second bill also dramatically tilts the playing field in favor of SLAPP litigants. The legislation would allow plaintiffs in these cases to be exempted from state law forcing them to pay defendants’ attorney fees if they lose. If enacted, it would be up to the judge’s discretion to award attorney fees. Critics of the bill say the mandatory awarding of attorney fees has a powerful deterrent effect against plaintiffs from bringing meritless intimidation lawsuits guaranteed to lose in court. “Amending those fees would put a bounty on the heads of SLAPP victims,” Prather explained. “You’re just going to see people settle more and start self-censoring… why take the financial risk?” This set of legislative changes is just the latest effort to kneecap Texas’ anti-SLAPP law. In 2019, the legislature approved an overhaul of the act that stripped out several categories of lawsuits covered by anti-SLAPP protections. Those alterations to the Texas anti-SLAPP law are still being interpreted by Texas courts, which is why opponents of the bills argue that further changes would only cause more legal uncertainty. Recent rulings from the Texas courts have also established new legal precedent that significantly limits freedom of speech in favor of powerful litigators. In a 2018 decision, a judge ruled that even if the specific contents of a published work are factual, the author may still be liable for “ defamation by gist ,” an expansive re-interpretation of permissible speech under the First Amendment. Business groups say their backlash to Texas’ anti-SLAPP law is motivated by several grievances. They claim that anti-SLAPP cases are being filed at such high volumes that they’re clogging up the appellate court system, despite evidence to the contrary. More broadly, opponents of the state’s anti-SLAPP law argue the protections are letting too many people speak critically against private businesses with impunity. “Getting SLAPPed around by the TCPA” is how one business group describes it. But the lobbying forces behind the bills suggest other motives at play. When identical bills were originally introduced in 2023, state insiders at the time saw them as the doing of a Texas businessman disgruntled about a SLAPP case he lost , which he blamed on the state’s protections. Brint Ryan, an influential state lobbyist and tax attorney, had been pursuing a lawsuit against media conglomerate Gannett for a USA Today article casting doubt on his business dealings in Arizona. Though the bills passed the Senate that year, they didn’t make it into law. This year, however, the most prominent public-facing backer of both bills is an even more powerful force: Texans for Lawsuit Reform, a well-financed legal group with deep political connections in the Texas legislature described by insiders as the voice of the “business and political establishment.” Close allies with the Bush family, the group’s political action committee is bankrolled by a host of corporate forces, primarily the oil and gas industry . This past election cycle, Texans for Lawsuit Reform received a million-dollar donation from the state’s new billionaire activist, Elon Musk, to help lift Republican candidates up and down the ballot. One of their affiliated PACs, which is focused on electing Republican judges, accepted another $2 million in donations from Musk. Overall, the group amassed a warchest of more than $20 million to spend across the state and federal elections in the 2024 elections. Most state lawmakers have received a financial boost at some point from the group’s PACs. Texans for Lawsuit Reform frequently advocates for issues it believes will encourage companies to incorporate in Texas, siphoning business away from similarly laissez-faire states like Nevada and Delaware . One of the group’s signature legislative achievements came in 2023 when its lobbyists persuaded the legislature to approve specialized business courts to hear certain legal disputes. The arrangement, modeled on the Chancery Court in Delaware, is generally more amenable to corporations. The current anti-SLAPP bills would appear to be no different. If passed, eroding free speech protections could spread to other states competing with Texas. The fate of the legislation, however, is hotly contested even though Republicans control the legislature and the Governor’s house. The bills have inspired cross-ideological opposition from the “Protect Free Speech Coalition,” which includes liberal nonprofits like the ACLU and Public Citizen alongside conservative activist groups such as the National Right to Life Committee, plus media organizations spanning from Fox News to NBC. The bipartisan alliance, which has been calling lawmakers’ offices and mounting protests since the start of this year, is united by the belief that they all benefit from stronger protections against SLAPP lawsuits filed in response to their political speech or criticisms of corporate practices. On one level, the right flank of the coalition shares the same principles. But their hostility to the reforms also derives from the reputation that Texans for Lawsuit Reform has garnered as a vestige of the old-guard Bush era in Texas. In today’s political climate, marked by Trump’s coup against the traditional Republican establishment, the right’s country club wing has lost some political favor with the current populist GOP nationwide. “A few years ago, were still the 800-pound gorilla in the room… they asked for something and they got it,” said Republican lawyer Tony McDonald, who’s been mobilizing conservative groups to oppose the anti-SLAPP bills. McDonald has been on the receiving end of SLAPP threats from Brint Ryan, the Texas tax attorney who once told McDonald on X, “Keep going and you’ll find the TCPA won’t protect false statements like this.” The lobbying group’s grip on the state has slipped somewhat recently because of a major state fight they’re embroiled in. They are the bête noire of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a populist standard bearer for the new Texas GOP who recently announced he’d primary Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) in 2026 for not being sufficiently MAGA. Paxton very publicly blamed Texans for Lawsuit Reform and the “Bush machine” for instigating impeachment proceedings against him in 2023 for allegedly misusing public funds to help a donor, though those proceedings ultimately failed. Texans for Lawsuit Reform denies those allegations but remains a vocal opponent of the Paxton wing of the Texas GOP. The group’s advocacy to undermine free speech has only provided more ammunition to its detractors. Many of Paxton’s allies view the legislation as another indication that the group is out of step with the conservative base. “This is more about establishment versus anti-establishment,” said McDonald. Despite the financial power behind gutting SLAPP protections, proponents of the bills face a major challenge: even the Texas Republican Party includes a plank in its platform supporting the state’s ant-SLAPP law. That language, which was carefully slipped in last year by First Amendment advocates in anticipation of the current legislative fight, could be a harbinger of what’s to come in the final month of the legislative session.
Some countries have reportedly expected a better trade deal if they adopted the services of the billionaire’s company. Trump administration officials have reportedly been pressuring countries facing U.S. tariffs to approve satellite internet services offered by Elon Musk’s Starlink to help grease trade negotiations, further underscoring the conflicts of interest stemming from the mega-billionaire’s proximity to the White House. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that it obtained “a series of internal government messages” that “reveal how U.S. embassies and the State Department have pushed nations to clear hurdles for U.S. satellite companies, often mentioning Starlink by name.” “The documents do not show that the Trump team has explicitly demanded favors for Starlink in exchange for lower tariffs,” the newspaper added. “But they do indicate that Secretary of State Marco Rubio has increasingly instructed officials to push for regulatory approvals for Musk’s satellite firm at a moment when the White House is calling for wide-ranging talks on trade.” The Post points specifically to ongoing bilateral trade negotiations between the U.S. and India, where “government officials have sped through approvals of Starlink with the understanding that doing so could help them cement trade deals with the administration.” The Times of India reported Wednesday that Starlink, a subsidiary of Musk’s SpaceX, “has been issued a Letter of Intent by the Indian government for satcom services.” The corruption is staggering. So brazen. www.washingtonpost.com/business/202… Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the U.S.-based consumer advocacy group Public Citizen , said in response to the Post ’s reporting that “the glaring conflict of interest inherent in this pressure to preference a Musk-owned company is disgusting.” “The bottom line here is that tools of trade and government should be utilized for the benefit of the American public, not abused for personal tech bro profiteering,” Gilbert added. Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas.), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called the revelations “a huge new scandal.” “Trump and Musk are using tariffs as leverage to get other countries to buy from Musk’s companies. Working families pay $4,000+ more a year so Musk gets new deals,” Casar wrote on social media. “They get richer. Everyone else gets screwed.” Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump partially paused the more aggressive tariffs he sought to impose on countries around the world while leaving in place 10% across-the-board import duties, which are already raising costs for American families. The Post reported Wednesday that “at least two countries have explicitly discussed or moved toward adopting Musk’s Starlink as a means of avoiding Trump’s tariffs and negotiating a better trade deal with the United States.” Cambodia, which is facing a potential 49% tariff rate , appears to be one of those countries. The Post obtained a U.S. embassy cable indicating that Cambodian officials have signaled a “desire to help balance our trade relationship by promoting the market entry of leading U.S. companies such as Boeing and Starlink.” “Another cable from April 17 reported that Starlink was pushing for a license to operate in Djibouti,” the newspaper reported. “Embassy staffers wrote they would help Starlink as much as they could: ‘Post will continue to follow up with Starlink in identifying government officials and facilitating discussions.'” U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said the internal cables show “gross corruption.” Congressional Democrats are already probing the White House’s use of Starlink services. “Surprise, surprise: another Trump move that directly benefits Elon Musk — the guy who spent $260 million to elect Donald Trump and has been given the keys to the federal government,” said Van Hollen. “They are rigging the government for themselves.”
Within days, federal funds reserved for at-risk refugees will be used to resettle Dutch-descended Afrikaners. This article was originally published by The Lever , an investigative newsroom. If you like this story, sign up for The Lever ’s free newsletter. As President Donald Trump tries to bar almost all refugees from entering the country, his administration is planning to use federal funds reserved for sick, elderly, and at-risk refugee populations to facilitate an influx of white South Africans within days, according to a government source and an internal memo viewed by The Lever . The first group of Dutch-descended Afrikaners is scheduled to arrive in the United States imminently, and they will be receiving emergency support from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, according to the memo, which was signed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy and Office of Refugee Resettlement assistant secretary Andrew Gradison. The move follows Trump’s February executive order demanding humanitarian relief for Afrikaners. Trump booster Elon Musk — himself a South African immigrant — has said South Africa’s government was unfair and racist to white people. Since the executive order, U.S. officials have been interviewing white South African applicants who claim to have faced racial discrimination in postapartheid South Africa. At the same time, refugees from the rest of the world, some of whom have been waiting for years to enter the country, have been left in limbo after Trump in January suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, affecting an estimated 20,000 refugees set to travel to the U.S. — including 12,000 who already had flights booked. That ban is currently being challenged in court. In the April 30 memo, which has not previously been reported, officials with the Office of Refugee Resettlement wrote to Kennedy, requesting approval for the “mobilization of immediate support for vulnerable incoming Afrikaner refugees,” including “housing, health services, and resettlement support upon their arrival.” The group of Afrikaners, officials wrote, was slated to arrive “within a few days of this memo,” and therefore officials needed approval to make emergency arrangements outside of typical refugee resettlement protocol. Kennedy signed and approved the document that day. According to a government source familiar with the plans, the Office of Refugee Resettlement has preliminary arrangements to use funds from a program called Preferred Communities to resettle the Afrikaners. The program’s website notes that it is for the most vulnerable refugees arriving in the U.S., including “those with serious medical conditions, women at risk, and elderly refugees.” The agency is preparing to resettle as many as 1,000 Afrikaners this year, the source said. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services responded to a request for comment after publication and confirmed that Preferred Communities program funding would be used in resettling Afrikaners. Last month, U.S. Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) introduced legislation to recognize Afrikaners as Priority 2 refugees — a designation that they are “of special humanitarian concern,” according to the U.S. State Department . Though that legislation has not passed, the Trump administration memo asserts powers in “emergency circumstances provide assistance to refugees without regard to select laws and regulations.” The use of any refugee resettlement funds — for vulnerable refugees or not — to support white South Africans has drawn fierce outcry . Afrikaners, the descendants of Dutch settlers in South Africa, codified the nation’s apartheid racial segregation system in 1948 and subsequently subjected the country’s Black population to mass evictions and brutal segregation. White South Africans, as the end of apartheid neared in the early 1990s, owned the vast majority of the nation’s land . Even decades after the end of the apartheid system, white South Africans still own more than 70 percent of the country’s agricultural land, despite making up less than 10 percent of the overall population. The government’s efforts at land redistribution — including a new January land reform law — are designed to address this disparity. In his February order, Trump claimed that Afrikaners were “escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination,” as well as “racially discriminatory property confiscation,” and demanded that U.S. officials draft plans to provide relief, including refugee resettlement, to Afrikaners. Afrikaners have been vocal supporters of Trump, and Musk, who grew up in South Africa under apartheid, has been a vocal opponent of what he calls “racist ownership laws,” in the country. Musk is not himself Afrikaner but descended from more recent British and Canadian white settlers in the country. Musk has also been vocal about alleged violence against white South African farmers, claiming in 2023 that “they are actually killing white farmers every day.” The country’s courts have found that such claims are baseless . In the days after Trump’s order was issued in February, senior White House officials met with AfriForum, a powerful group that advocates for South Africa’s Afrikaner minority. The group reportedly requested that Trump intervene in South Africa’s land expropriation policy on behalf of white South Africans. Though AfriForum formally rejected Trump’s offer of refugee status to Afrikaners, a reported 8,200 Afrikaners have independently expressed interest in the offer. At the same time, Trump has been attempting to freeze all other refugee admissions into the country, including for those fleeing violence and persecution in the Congo, Afghanistan, and Sudan. On Monday, a federal judge ordered the government to allow 12,000 refugees , all those who had already made travel plans to the U.S., into the country. But even if the Trump administration complies with that order, thousands more asylum-seekers in the middle of an arduous, yearslong approval process will be left stranded — all while the administration welcomes Afrikaners with open arms.
“They are terminating people’s financial lives,” the former Social Security Administration commissioner says. Rennie Glasgow, who has served 15 years at the Social Security Administration, is seeing something new on the job: dead people. They’re not really dead, of course. In four instances over the past few weeks, he told KFF Health News , his Schenectady, New York, office has seen people come in for whom “there is no information on the record, just that they are dead.” So employees have to “resurrect” them — affirm that they’re living, so they can receive their benefits. Revivals were “sporadic” before, and there’s been an uptick in such cases across upstate New York, said Glasgow. He is also an official with the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represented 42,000 Social Security employees just before the start of President Donald Trump’s second term. Martin O’Malley, who led the Social Security Administration toward the end of the Joe Biden administration, said in an interview that he had heard similar stories during a recent town hall in Racine, Wisconsin. “In that room of 200 people, two people raised their hands and said they each had a friend who was wrongly marked as deceased when they’re very much alive,” he said. It’s more than just an inconvenience, because other institutions rely on Social Security numbers to do business, Glasgow said. Being declared dead “impacts their bank account. This impacts their insurance. This impacts their ability to work. This impacts their ability to get anything done in society.” “They are terminating people’s financial lives,” O’Malley said. Though it’s just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead. Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times , thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to “self-deport.” Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. “Why don’t you just do due diligence to make sure what you’re doing in the first place is correct?” he said. The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration’s crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program’s future. But KFF Health News ’ interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities. Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece’s difficulties with Social Security’s disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece’s address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer — whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record — believes they could be zero. Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece’s bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment. Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore. The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece’s disability payments, “then she will be homeless,” Seda recalled telling an agency employee. “I don’t know if I’m going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.” Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency’s efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, “it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,” the committee recently told the agency’s inspector general . While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they’re owed, she said. For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn’t be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to National Academy of Social Insurance survey results published in January. Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that’s nearly unprecedented in their experience. Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members’ March payments were several days late. “For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,” she said. “The delayed payment is not something I’ve heard in the last 20 years.” When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Trump’s “resounding mandate” to make government more efficient. “He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,” Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions. Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general’s office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News. A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security — which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 — had nearly doubled in March compared with last year. Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it’s getting worse as experienced employees have been let go. “We’re seeing more mistakes being made,” said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years’ experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. “We’re seeing more things get dropped.” What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn’t show. She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem — only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said. Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm’s policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored — the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there. “To be told they’ve never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,” the lawyer said. Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what’s behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency. Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O’Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. “As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,” he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. “It’s going to mean that if you go to a field office, you’re going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.” The departures have hit the agency’s regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It’s the type of behind-the-scenes work in which “the problems surface first,” Romig said. But if the staff doesn’t have enough time, “those things languish.” Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program. Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks “just sit there.” Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and “those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security’s own rules,” putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said. Employees’ technology is more often on the fritz. “There’s issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,” said Glasgow, of Social Security’s Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said. The new problems leave Glasgow suspecting the worst. “It’s more work for less bodies, which will eventually hype up the inefficiency of our job and make us, make the agency, look as though it’s underperforming, and then a closer step to the privatization of the agency,” he said.

We must believe in the future if we want to combat MAGA’s apocalyptic vision, says journalist Naomi Klein. An alliance between the far right and Silicon Valley oligarchs has given rise to a form of “end times fascism,” says journalist Naomi Klein, who details in a recent essay co-authored with Astra Taylor how many wealthy elites are preparing for the end of the world even as they contribute to growing inequality, political instability and the climate crisis. Klein says that while billionaires dream of escaping to bunkered enclaves or even to space, President Donald Trump and other right-wing leaders are turning their countries into militarized fortress states to keep out immigrants from abroad and ramp up authoritarian control domestically. “There’s always an apocalyptic quality to fascism, but fascism of the 1930s and ’40s had a horizon” for a utopian future, says Klein. Today, by contrast, “we’re up against people who are actively betting against the future — not just actively betting against it, but fueling the fires that are burning this world.” This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman. We spend the rest of the hour with award-winning journalist and author Naomi Klein. She has a major new piece out, co-authored with Astra Taylor, for The Guardian newspaper. It’s headlined “The rise of end times fascism.” It looks at the apocalyptic fervor of the far right. In it, they write, quote, “he most powerful people in the world are preparing for the end of the world, an end they themselves are frenetically accelerating. That is not so far away from the more mass-market vision of fortressed nations that has gripped the right globally, from Italy to Israel, Australia to the United States: in a time of ceaseless peril, openly supremacist movements in these countries are positioning their relatively wealthy states as armed bunkers,” Naomi Klein writes. She is also professor of climate justice at the University of British Columbia, founding co-director of the UBC Centre for Climate Justice. Her latest book, Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World . Naomi, welcome back to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us. If you can start off by talking about your piece and what exactly you mean by talking about the end times, fascism? NAOMI KLEIN: Well, it’s very good to be with you, Amy. This isn’t the most cheerful piece I’ve ever written, with Astra Taylor, a very close collaborator, founder of the Debt Collective. And we were trying to kind of map what is similar and what is different about the type of far-right politics that we’re seeing today. And I should say, the piece is not only grim. It also looks at what this can mean for a response to this particular form of fascism, because we can’t fight it if we don’t understand it. So, I think a lot of very good scholarship attempting to understand authoritarianism today, whether it’s Trump or figures like Duterte or Modi, have looked at similarities between these far-right figures and, say, Mussolini or Hitler, and have taken a kind of a checklist approach of looking at what is similar to the past, right? And I think there’s a lot of value in that. But the risk of it is that it doesn’t look at what is new and what is particular to our time. Fascism always is an attempt by the right to resolve a crisis of its own era. Right? So, in the 1930s, they were attempting to resolve, you know, in Germany, the humiliations of the First World War, the impacts of the Great Depression, and to propose a unity in the face of that for the in-group. But our moment is different, and one of the things that makes it different — I mean, if you think about fascism in the 1930s, this is before the atomic bomb. It’s before they understood climate change. And we are in a moment where our elites, whether they admit it or not, do understand that our economic model — and I’ve written books about this and talked about it with you in the past — is at war with life on Earth, right? And they are barreling down this road of more and more extraction of fossil fuels, of all kinds of — you know, basically, anything they can extract from this Earth and turn into energy and money, particularly now with AI, which is a energy and resource hog — water, LNG, critical minerals, all of it. So, we’re trying to understand how this is informing the kind of fascism that we’re seeing, and also we’re trying to understand what unites this kind of strange Frankenstein coalition that Trump represents, where he’s bringing together these — you know, the richest people in the world who have ever existed with many working-class people, so what binds the vision, right? And what we cope with in this piece, or what we propose in this piece, is that they all have given up on this world. Like, they all have bought into a kind of apocalyptic fever — right? — whether it’s Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and their investments in outer space and sort of writing off this planet, whether AI, which is willing to sacrifice this animate world in order to build an artificial world, or whether it’s the more populist MAGA vision of the fortress nation-state — right? — which is thinking, “OK, we know more and more people are going to be coming. We know that disaster is on the horizon.” I’ve listened to a lot of Steve Bannon for — you know, when I was writing Doppelganger , and it’s all very survivalist, right? You know, all of the commercials, pretty much, are selling, you know, gold, because the economy is going to collapse, you know, ready-to-eat meals for 90 days, because you never know what’s going to happen. So, it sees the nation and the in-group as being inside the bunker, and then it’s exiling the out-group to all of these lawless territories that you’ve been covering on the show. So, it’s not the same vision, but what it shares is this apocalyptic fever. And then, of course, all of it is following a similar structure, like narrative structure, to the biblical Rapture. And, of course, you have people who believe in that within the Trump coalition, who are, you know, Christian Zionists, like Mike Huckabee and Pete Hegseth, who believe that the actual end times is coming, and they think it’s all going to go down in Israel. And all of the horror that you report on so well and so committedly on the show, these are all good signs if you believe in the Rapture, right? Because it means that the end is coming, and the faithful are going to be lifted up to a golden city in the sky. So, you know, what we’re looking at is like the religious version of that story, the the fundamentalist religious version of that story, where you literally believe you’re going to be saved and taken up to heaven, but also the secular vision, where your wealth protects you, or your citizenship protects you, and you get your own version of that golden, bunkered city. AMY GOODMAN: You mentioned Gaza, and you just came from the Jewish Voice for Peace conference in Baltimore, where several thousand people gathered from around the country. Our latest headline, the Israeli military calling up tens of thousands of reservists as Israel’s security cabinet unanimously approved plans this weekend to expand its assault on Gaza, where Israel has already killed over 52,000 Palestinians — and that’s by far an undercount — in the last 18, 19 months. Israel has killed more than 2,400 Palestinians just since it shattered the ceasefire in March. This comes as Israel’s devastating blockade in food aid has entered its third month. Palestinian health officials say 57 Palestinians have already starved to death. According to UNICEF, more than 9,000 children have been admitted for treatment for acute malnutrition so far this year. And aid groups, like Norwegian Refugee Council, blasting a new Israeli proposal to take control in distribution and put U.S. security contractors in charge. If you can talk, as you so often do, about what’s happening in Gaza and the West Bank and what the centrality of Israel in President Trump and the current U.S. government — although it was also the past, President Biden’s worldview and approach to foreign policy? NAOMI KLEIN: So, I don’t think there is a single answer to understanding what the driving forces are. And this is what we’re trying to get at, is that there’s a kind of an overlap of these different apocalyptic worldviews. Some of them are religious, and some of them are secular, right? So, I think that people who subscribe to this, like, literalist version of the Rapture believe that all of this is good news, in the sense that, according to the story that they believe in, that the Israelites have to return to Greater Israel. Those are the preconditions for the return of the Messiah. They have to rebuild the Third Temple. So you have this convergence of interests between the religious extremists and the Netanyahu government, who are absolutely committed to rebuilding the Third Temple. They really want to do it. They want to destroy Al-Aqsa. This is why so much attention is focused on it. But then, you know, does Trump believe that? I don’t think Trump believes that. I mean, what he views for Gaza is he sees resources. He sees money. He sees a private, you know, resort. AMY GOODMAN: Resort. NAOMI KLEIN: Exactly. But this is something I’ve been saying from the beginning. I think the interests have been fairly consistent in terms of what the end goal is, which is a depopulation of Gaza, pushing Palestinians out, whether through death or whether through forced exile, whether through ethnic cleansing. And under the Biden administration, there was a denial that that was what was going on. And under the Trump administration, it’s all out in the open. So, you know, this is what is going on. Now, what the reason for that is, I think, differs. But this is what — part of what we’re getting at in the piece, Astra and I, is that there is a confluence of interests in terms of what Israel represents. Some of the supporters of the Trump administration in the tech industry are talking about wanting freedom cities, for instance, these privatized, corporate cities. And they talk about this as tech Zionism. They have a lot of admiration for the idea that Israel was created, they say, you know, from a book, Theodor Herzl’s books. And they said, “Well, why can’t we start our own country, our own private countries? Why do we have to — you know, why do we have to abide by the rules of the nation-state?” So, I think part of the support for Israel isn’t just our classic understandings either of Jewish Zionism or Christian Zionism, although that’s absolutely going on. It’s also this idea of a very technologically advanced startup country, right? Israel has marketed itself that way. And a lot of these tech companies want to do that in San Francisco. They want to push everybody out who doesn’t agree with them, who’s poor, who have more needs, and create their kind of corporate, privatized utopia. So, you know, I’m not saying this is a coherent agenda. I’m saying that there’s a lot of overlapping stories that follow a similar structure and share similar goals, if that makes sense. AMY GOODMAN: I mean, yes, I mean, the overall issue, obviously, is hard to make sense of. NAOMI KLEIN: Mm-hmm, yeah. AMY GOODMAN: And most Trump’s supporters are neither wealthy nor are they Christian Zionists. So, why are they backing this whole approach? NAOMI KLEIN: Well, it’s not clear the extent to which they actively back it, but I think that they see a kinship in the ethnostate — right? — because a lot of Trump supporters are becoming increasingly Christian nationalist about the United States. And this has been carefully fostered by figures like Steve Bannon. And so, when they look at Israel, they see a country that is openly an ethnostate that is fortressing itself in a sea of its enemies, you know, and they want to do something similar. And they’re sharing technologies. They’re sharing, you know, legal precedents, tools. So, there’s a — you know, there’s a kinship. And, you know, we’re seeing this now with India with its attacks on Kashmir, following us, you know, using similar techniques that, you know, Israel has used in Gaza. So, there is a kind of a solidarity of the ethnostates. And they are sharing — you know, they’re even trading trinkets of golden pagers and swapping chainsaws. You know, this is something that we — I think, you know, when you’re inside the crucible of it here in the United States under Trump, it’s hard to see the extent to which this is an international project on the right, and they are influencing one another. AMY GOODMAN: And what does unite them, you know, this whole fortress mentality, is this hatred of immigrants. You have — NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: — President Trump just saying he doesn’t even know — he’s not a lawyer, so he doesn’t know if he has to uphold the Constitution, he said. NAOMI KLEIN: Right. I mean, this is what I’m trying to get at about the awareness that we are in an age of consequences, that when you don’t act in the face of the climate crisis for decades, when scientists have been warning you, that more and more of the world becomes uninhabitable, and, lo and behold, people move to try to find safety in the face of wars, in the face of economic deprivation and in the face of ecological disasters. And so, that fortressing of the nation-state — and this is what I think, you know, Israel’s come to represent, just as a very small nation that is extremely fortressed — right? — whether it’s with the high-tech walls, the Iron Dome. Trump says now, “I want not an Iron Dome, but a golden dome.” Right? That — AMY GOODMAN: Here. NAOMI KLEIN: Here. That all of this is, whether it’s stated explicitly or not — AMY GOODMAN: And a military parade that’ll cost tens of millions — NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: — of dollars, even as he slices and dices the government, on his birthday, in June. NAOMI KLEIN: Right. So the pattern is protecting the in-group and exiling and cleansing the out-groups. Right? And so, that, I think, is — you know, if there is support among the MAGA base for Israel, it’s less out of a love for Israel than more out of an identification, like they are doing what we want to do here. AMY GOODMAN: You write many things in your piece , and I just want to go to one of them. You say — in talking about Musk’s apocalyptic vision, you talk about, and also detailing the end times fascism, this whole issue of the rise of the city state, the corporate city state. I think this is a new concept for many. They’re not going to know what you’re talking about. NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: In southern Texas, Starbase, just this group of people, who are mainly workers at SpaceX, have just voted to make a city right there? NAOMI KLEIN: Mm-hmm, yeah. And we’ve had sort of — I mean, the idea of a company town is not entirely new, right? And Disney had Celebration, Florida, and there are lineages to this, right? Colonial lineages to this. You know, I live in Canada, which started as the Hudson’s Bay Company, right? So it was a company before it was a country. So there is some precedent for this. But I think what this is — I’ve been following this out of the corner of my eye, Amy, because this is where libertarians have been going for a while. There was an — Peter Thiel has been obsessed with this idea. It’s increasingly being called exit, so exiting the nation and just starting your own country, where you can set your own tax level, you can make your own regulations. AMY GOODMAN: Or not. NAOMI KLEIN: Or not. And countries — and these little corporate countries will compete with one another to try to attract capital, right? So, in a way, it’s an extension of the free trade zone — right? — where this is, in a way, like a denationalized country within a country. But Trump started to float this in 2023, the idea that he would create 10 freedom cities, on the campaign trail. I don’t think his base much knew what he was talking about. But now you have all these lobbyists who fully intend to take him up on it. And we’re starting to see the beginning of this with this SpaceX city. AMY GOODMAN: So, you also write about El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, the notorious prison, CECOT, where so many hundreds of people have been sent from the United States, and at the same time, in the last 24 hours, President Trump saying he wants to reopen the notorious Alcatraz — NAOMI KLEIN: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: — an island in San Francisco. If you can talk about the prison as a model for what Trump wants to put forward, and particularly in relation, as we see motivating so much, to immigrants? NAOMI KLEIN: Well, this is an incredibly bleak vision. So, repression is always a huge part of any kind of fascist project, right? You need to contain the out-group. You need to disappear the out-group. So this part of it is not new. But I think what is so worrying to me is that Trump was elected promising all kinds of things to his base, right? He promised to eliminate inflation. He promised to bring these great jobs home. He’s not delivering on any of that. So the sadistic part of his project is really all he has to offer, right? I think one of the most chilling things I’ve ever seen in the United States was Trump sharing that video at his hundred-day rally of just pure sadism, of just looking at prisoners, as entertainment, being shaved, being shackled, being paraded. And he’s not delivering on the price of eggs. And he’s not delivering on the jobs, by the way, because he’s throwing all in— he’s going all in on AI. So the jobs that are coming back seem to be mainly for robots. It’s not actually for his base. And so, this scales up the need for the sadism and these spectacles, right? And I think that that’s what something like Alcatraz represents. He’s a TV producer, first and foremost, right? He’s producing spectacles. And the less he has to offer economically, tangibly, materially, the more he leans on the sadism. AMY GOODMAN: You write, “The governing ideology of the far right … has become a monstrous, supremacist survivalism. … Our task is to build a movement strong enough to stop them.” What would that movement look like, or what do you see is being formed right now? NAOMI KLEIN: You know, what we’re doing in this piece by laying out the bleakness of the vision — and when I say “bleakness,” you know, I think it’s beyond something we’ve seen before, because there’s always an apocalyptic quality to fascism, but fascism of the 1930s and ’40s had a horizon. Like, after the apocalypse, people were being promised a future, a pastoral, peaceful little piece of land where they could live out their lives, you know? Even though Trump talks about a golden age, there really isn’t a future that the base believes in, you know? And this is what I’ve learned by consuming far too much MAGA media, Amy. They envision a future of endless war, right? And this is why they’re bunkering down. This is why they’re buying ready-to-eat meals to last. This is why they’re buying gold and crypto. They think the whole thing is going down. So — AMY GOODMAN: And why Elon Musk is trying to have so many children, at least 14 at this point. But he’s actually explicitly texted it, saying, “We’ve got to do this much faster,” as he proposed to one of the women he has children with, saying, “We’ve got to start using surrogates.” NAOMI KLEIN: So, they don’t believe in the future, is the bottom line. And that is — you know, I think I’ve been in a lot of progressive spaces in recent months where we’ve talked about building these very broad coalitions, including with people who we don’t entirely disagree with. I’ve never encountered a potential coalition more broad than the idea of: How about if we believe in this world? How about if we believe in the future? Because we’re up against people who are actively betting against the future, right? Not just actively betting against it — AMY GOODMAN: Twenty seconds. NAOMI KLEIN: — but fueling the fires that are burning this world, actively fueling it. So, I think that if we have the courage, really, to look at the bleakness of what they believe in, which is an apocalyptic future, then we have our work cut out for us of being the people who actually believe in this realm, in this world, in the beauty of creation and of each other. AMY GOODMAN: Naomi Klein, I want to thank you for being with us, award-winning journalist, author, columnist. We’ll link to your piece with Astra Taylor, “The rise of end times fascism.” I’m Amy Goodman. This is Democracy Now!
Elon Musk’s DOGE is inflicting crashes, hang-ups and hours-long waits on Social Security recipients, eroding trust. In recent months, people trying to reach the Social Security Administration (SSA) have encountered website crashes, automatic hang-ups and hours-long waits on the phone or in person. But horrible customer service appears to be just the first step in Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s plan to destroy Social Security — the United States’ largest social welfare program, which provides benefits to 73 million people , or one in five U.S. residents. President Donald Trump has granted Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) team significant access and power within SSA. In just three months, the agency has implemented plans to decrease the staff count from 57,000 to 50,000 (with rumors of deeper cuts to come), started closing offices, made it harder for people to register and access benefits, spread lies about fraud, accessed recipients’ personal information, and created an environment of chaos, fear and confusion. All the while, DOGE is on an obsessive hunt for widespread benefits fraud, which one federal judge characterized as “a search for the proverbial needle in the haystack, without any concrete knowledge that the needle is actually in the haystack.” Advocates fear that as DOGE makes Social Security increasingly nonfunctional, trust in the enormously popular program will erode, allowing Musk and his allies the opportunity to further weaken or privatize aspects of the program. Weakening Social Security has serious and even deadly consequences: Among older people who receive benefits, 39 percent of men and 44 percent of women derive more than half their income from it. Around 80 percent of recipients are retired workers (or their spouses and dependents), who paid into the system during their working years, while the rest qualify due to a disability or are children of deceased workers. Despite its crucial role lifting millions of Americans out of poverty, Trump and Musk repeatedly disparage the program as dysfunctional, rife with fraud, or an outright scam. In February, Trump falsely claimed that millions of dead Americans were collecting benefits, alleging: “It’s all a scam, the whole thing is a scam.” Meanwhile, in a recent interview with Joe Rogan, Musk called Social Security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time .” And in a FOX Business interview about DOGE cuts, Musk ominously called entitlements like SSA “ the big one to eliminate .” (The White House insists Musk was referring to eliminating “waste and fraud,” not entitlement programs in their entirety.) “Never before did we have a president claiming that there was all this fraud where there wasn’t any, or all this waste where there wasn’t any,” Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a political advocacy group that calls for expansion of Social Security, told Truthout . “And then using that to make changes precipitously, without any kind of thought — some of which are just going to create more fraud. And no one has ever had access to all this data, people’s most personal data.” Trump replaced his initial acting SSA Commissioner , Michelle King, a 30-year veteran of the agency, in February after she refused to allow DOGE unfettered access to recipients’ private data. Her replacement is Leland Dudek, a mid-level staffer, who at the time was on administrative leave for leaking information to DOGE behind his supervisors’ backs. Unsurprisingly, Dudek has acted as a rubber stamp for DOGE’s staff-cutting agenda. “DOGE has been all over the Social Security Administration,” said Altman. “They’re calling the shots.” Under Dudek, SSA rapidly laid off employees, offered buyouts to the entire staff, ordered the entire workforce back into the office full-time, dissolved teams , announced the closure of 6 out of 10 regional offices and circulated plans to close dozens of field offices. “It’s not an exaggeration to say around 1,000 years of institutional experience and knowledge have walked out the door,” said Altman. “The top cyber security people, the top people who maintain the systems, and so forth. … There has really been an enormous brain drain from the agency, and that’s continuing.” Dudek admitted, behind closed doors, that he is following the orders of DOGE and the White House. “I work for the president. I need to do what the president tells me to do,” Dudek told senior SSA staff and advocates in a mid-March recording leaked to ProPublica . “I’ve had to make some tough choices, choices I didn’t agree with, but the president wanted it and I did it.” Later in the meeting, Dudek said: “Again, I work for the president. DOGE is part of that.” Trump’s nominee to lead the agency, Frank Bisignano, is a financial services CEO with a net worth of around $1 billion . Bisignano, who told CNBC he is “fundamentally a DOGE person,” has a reputation for cutting staff, while taking home 380 times the compensation of the median employee at his company. Bisignano apparently lied at a March 25 confirmation hearing, telling the Senate Finance Committee he hasn’t had contact with SSA or DOGE. But a whistleblower told Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) that Bisignano has had frequent conversations with SSA executives, requested explicit approval of all hires and intervened to ensure a DOGE engineer was hired and given immediate access to private data systems — claims that were confirmed by the Washington Post . Although the Finance Committee voted along party lines to advance Bisignano’s nomination in March, Senate Democrats are calling for Trump to withdraw the nomination . “There’s a trust gap between the nominee and the American people before he’s even gotten in the door,” Wyden said in a statement. Social Security employees and beneficiaries are feeling the effects of the mayhem introduced under Dudek. Staff is stretched thin and demoralized, struggling to keep up with constant changes from above, and dealing with a growing backlog of claims. Spending freezes leave workers unable to purchase office supplies, make copies of documents or hire necessary services like interpreters for hearings. “This chainsaw of the Musk-Trump co-presidency is gutting this agency. It is breaking it from within.” The SSA website is crashing repeatedly, and callers find themselves hung up on or put on hold for hours. Meanwhile, the team in charge of monitoring customer experience was cut by DOGE. AARP reported that its help line is flooded with calls from confused, frustrated and angry older people. “Morale is in the toilet,” an employee told the Washington Post in March. “We all know what DOGE wants to do, which is just break us, so they can privatize us.” “What’s going on is the destruction of the agency from the inside out, and it’s accelerating,” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) told the Washington Post . “I have people approaching me all the time in their 70s and 80s, and they’re beside themselves. They don’t know what’s coming.” Even before Trump came into office, SSA was at a 50-year staffing low , following years of budget cuts forced by Republicans. Even as more than 11,200 Americans turn 65 each day, the agency’s operating overhead costs remain incredibly efficient at below 1 percent, all the while never missing a month of payments. But it might not keep that record for long. “This chainsaw of the Musk-Trump co-presidency is gutting this agency. It is breaking it from within,” Martin O’Malley, former SSA commissioner under President Biden, testified before the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee on April 1. “And it ultimately will lead to cascading failures, interruptions and system shutdowns that will eventually — and I think within the next couple of months — lead to benefit interruptions for the first time in 90 years.” A former deputy SSA commissioner under George W. Bush has expressed similar concern s that benefits could soon be disrupted. “It would appear that what they’re trying to do is crater this agency, and kneecap its ability to serve the public,” O’Malley testified. “They have to do that, because 80 percent of Americans believe that Social Security should be strengthened and made better. So they can’t really rob it, until they wreck it and sour enough of the public against it.” He warned: “I truly believe that the Musk-Trump co-presidency has already taken 90 percent of the actions necessary to crater this agency.” While Trump and Bisignano insist they will not cut benefits, advocates and Democratic politicians argue that cutting services achieves the same end. “here are backdoor ways to accomplish the same thing as a benefits cut,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) pointed out in Bisignano’s hearing. “onger lines, more errors, and everyone who gives up or dies before they get their benefits sorted out due to those delays is also a benefit cut.” Bisignano deflected a question on whether Social Security should be privatized, stating, “I’ve never heard a word of it, and I’ve never thought about it.” In his 2000 book, Trump called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” and called for its privatization . And in a leaked March email to staff , Dudek alarmed advocates by saying the agency would begin to outsource “non-essential functions to industry experts,” a seeming reference to privatizing aspects of the program. Altman warned that as DOGE messes with SSA and makes system crashes more likely, it could open the door for privatization. “There’s about $1.5 trillion that flows through Social Security. None of that goes to Wall Street or any of these for-profit companies,” she said. “But I think these ‘tech bros’ and others would love to get their hands on it.” She fears that if the Trump administration breaks the system and disrupts benefits, “They’ll say, ‘See? Government can’t do it. We’ve got to get the private sector.’” She also warns that if SSA outsources customer services, people needing assistance will find themselves “trapped in an AI nightmare.” “There are so many reasons that artificial intelligence just cannot do what humans do on this program,” explained Altman. “People who call don’t always know exactly what their issue is, or how to describe it, and it takes some conversation to figure it out. And sometimes they have one problem, and then they discover there’s three others. And the other thing is that people call at very vulnerable times. You know, they’ve lost a loved one, or they’re disabled and can no longer work.” Another key strategy to destroy trust in Social Security is lying about widespread benefits fraud . Trump and Musk repeatedly tout the fact that millions of Social Security accounts exist for people born more than 100 years ago — even though the vast majority are not receiving benefits. In fact, of the 18.9 million centenarians in the SSA database without a recorded death date, 18.4 million haven’t received benefits in over 50 years. The claim is so off-base that even Dudek has disputed it . Musk also repeatedly suggests that millions of noncitizens illegally receive Social Security benefits. At an April rally that was part of Musk’s failed attempt to buy a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat, Musk and DOGE associate Antonio Gracias presented a so-called “mind-blowing chart,” showing that millions of immigrants have Social Security numbers . But this is not fraud: Immigrants who are legally authorized to work are issued Social Security numbers. In fact, undocumented immigrants (who do not receive Social Security numbers, but are required to pay federal taxes) contributed $25.7 billion in Social Security taxes in 2022, even though they are ineligible to receive benefits. In an even more wild claim, Musk has repeatedly accused Biden of illegally handing out Social Security numbers to immigrants to encourage voter fraud in a “massive, large-scale program to import as many illegals as possible, ultimately to change the entire voting map of the United States.” Musk , DOGE members and Vice President J.D. Vance have all also peddled the absurd lie that 40 percent of calls to SSA are fraudulent. This may be a gross misrepresentation of an entirely different statistic: That 40 percent of SSA direct deposit fraud incidents occurred via phone calls. In congressional testimony, O’Malley corrected the claim, noting that, in fact, just 0.032 percent of calls to SSA are successful attempts at direct deposit fraud. Musk, who has promised to slash $2 trillion from the federal budget, seems to hope to find much of that in SSA. But the fraud and waste just aren’t there: On average, SSA makes $9 billion in improper payments each year, representing less than 1 percent of total payments (largely through overpayments and error, not fraud), most of which is ultimately recovered, according to a 2024 Inspector General report . “They have just done this over and over again on Social Security, just coming up with these wild claims that bear no resemblance to the truth,” Kathleen Romig, director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told the Washington Post . What’s more, DOGE seems to be using its fraud allegations to justify major policy overhauls. “In the name of preventing fraud, they make these changes, and the changes keep coming,” said Altman. “It’s created waste and inefficiency, and actually the opportunity for fraud.” Citing fraud protection, SSA abruptly announced in mid-March that people would no longer be able to apply for benefits or make changes to their direct deposits by phone. Instead, these activities could only be done online or in-person at a field office. Social Security advocates and recipients were alarmed. Many older Americans lack internet access or the technological savvy to apply for benefits online — a problem set to worsen if the SSA website keeps crashing. But to visit in person, they would have to wait hours on the phone to make an appointment, survive without benefits for weeks or months until the next available appointment and travel to the field office ( at least a 45-mile round trip for 6 million older adults, many of whom don’t drive). The SSA estimated that ending these phone services would add 75,000 to 85,000 new in-person office visits each week. In response to public outcry, SSA scrapped the changes on April 9. But other changes remain in place, and the rapid announcements have created an environment of confusion and fear for recipients. Rather than rooting out actual fraud, the confusion at SSA has made recipients more susceptible to scams. “Scammers have been sending out very official looking notices saying, ‘Okay, you’ve got to authenticate yourself, or your benefits are going to stop,’” said Altman. “It looks very official, and you’re desperate, you can’t live without your benefits.” DOGE meddling also increases the risk of a data breach. In testimony , former SSA acting Chief of Staff Tiffany Flick described how, under Dudek, DOGE associates were given sensitive information without requisite training, which they viewed from within Trump’s Office of Personnel Management offices, surrounded by White House staffers. In this environment, she warned, “Others could take pictures of the data, transfer it to other locations, and even feed it into AI programs. In such a chaotic environment, the risk of data leaking into the wrong hands is significant.” She also warned that SSA’s IT is built on an “incredibly complex web of systems” that are extremely reliable, but could easily be broken by DOGE associates, leading to benefits delays. In a lawsuit brought by unions and retiree advocacy groups, federal Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander issued a preliminary injunction in mid-April, blocking DOGE from accessing personal SSA data, and ordering them to delete any already obtained, including Social Security numbers, medical information, payment and bank records, earnings and tax information. She also required DOGE to remove software installed on SSA systems and stop accessing SSA code. This was an extension of Hollander’s March temporary restraining order , in which she noted that “the DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.” Complaining about the order to Bloomberg , Dudek initially claimed it would force him to essentially shut down the agency , and promising: “I will follow it exactly and terminate access by all SSA employees to our IT systems.” Hollander called Dudek’s representation “inaccurate,” noting that her order “expressly applies only to SSA employees working on the DOGE agenda.” In response, Dudek walked back his threats to close down SSA. Dudek has also helped Trump weaponize Social Security. In late February, SSA abruptly cancelled two contracts for the collection and maintenance of data on births and deaths in Maine, a move that would have forced parents to register their newborns at a Social Security office instead of the hospital. When a senior SSA official warned that the cancellations would increase fraud, Dudek emailed back : “Please cancel the contracts. While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child.” That “petulant child” was Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, whom Dudek believed had been “disrespectful” and “unprofessional” to Trump. Mills had drawn Trump’s ire for insisting that Maine would follow state and federal law, and would not ban transgender athletes from girls’ and women’s sports. While the data contract cancellations were rolled back, Trump has continued other retaliatory attacks on the state. The Trump administration is also using SSA to attack immigrants. In April, SSA added thousands of migrants to the agency’s “death master file,” with the intention of cutting them off from banks, credit cards and government benefits. And in March, it was reported that SSA has frozen a process called Enumeration-Beyond-Entry , in which immigrants who are granted work authorization are automatically issued and mailed Social Security cards. This change will create more work and costs for SSA, while adding hurdles for immigrant workers. Despite being enormously popular, SSA has long weathered attacks from the right — often through claims the program is unsustainable. From the mid-1980s through 2020, Social Security collected more each year than it paid out, allowing it to build trust funds worth $2.8 trillion . But as the American population ages, the latest Social Security Trustees’ Report indicates that by 2033, the agency may no longer be able to pay out full benefits. But there are solutions to shore up the program. Currently, wages above $176,100 are not taxed for Social Security. Altman’s organization, Social Security Works, supports bills from Democratic congressmembers that would lift or eliminate this so-called “wage cap .” In addition, the payroll tax could be increased, and promoting and expanding legal immigration would increase the size of the workforce. Despite Republican attacks, Social Security has remained extremely popular over the years. And so far, public anger over the current problems seems to be directed at Trump, Musk and DOGE. Voters have berated Republican Congressmembers at town halls, demanding they protect Social Security and sharing their horror stories and fears . Trump’s approval rating dropped in mid-March, including a drop among older people from 49 to 45 percent. While Democrats have never attempted to destroy the Social Security system, many Democratic presidents have signed legislation reducing or cutting benefits for certain groups. In 1994, Bill Clinton supported cutting people off disability SSA benefits after 36 months if their disability was based on drug or alcohol use. And in a 2011 effort to compromise with Tea Party congressmembers obsessed with lowering the national debt, Barack Obama supported an ultimately failed “grand bargain” agreement that would have raised taxes on the rich while cutting social safety net programs, including Social Security. (In the final month of his presidency, Joe Biden signed legislation that boosted some recipients’ benefits, by ending provisions that limit benefits for some public service retirees.) Although SSA has long faced attacks, Altman said this time is “qualitatively different.” “It strikes me what they’re trying to do is convince everybody there’s an enormous amount of fraud. Then they can say, ‘Hey, we’re not cutting legitimate benefits. We’re cutting fraud.’ And also, perhaps make the whole thing collapse, and privatize the administration. And then beyond that — who knows.”
Gov. Evers says Trump’s team and GOP allies twisted a routine instruction into a “fake controversy.” Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers hit back Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump’s border czar suggested the Democratic leader could be arrested for distributing guidance to state employees on what to do if confronted by federal immigration agents. The guidance is straightforward and unremarkable, instructing state employees to “stay calm,” ask federal agents for their name and badge, contact an attorney, and decline to answer questions or provide agents access to any documents without a lawyer present. “State employees may not grant or another agent access to any such data or information absent authorization from their legal counsel pursuant to a valid judicial warrant,” the guidance reads. In a speech addressed to Wisconsinites and the nation, Evers said that the “goal of this guidance was simple — to provide clear, consistent instructions to state employees and ensure they have a lawyer to help them comply with all federal and state laws.” “But Republicans and their right-wing allies, including Elon Musk , lied about this guidance, spread misinformation, accused me of doing things I didn’t do or say, and fueled a fake controversy of their own creation,” Evers said. One Republican member of the Wisconsin State Assembly on Friday morning posted an AI-generated image of Evers in handcuffs at the state capitol, with Trump standing behind him in police uniform. “I’m used to Republicans and the right wing lying about me. It comes with the job,” Evers said Friday. “But, this time, these lies came at a cost. I haven’t broken the law. I haven’t committed a crime. And I’ve never encouraged or directed anyone to break any laws or commit any crimes.” “But when President Trump’s hand-picked appointee, Tom Homan, was asked about me and this guidance after he apparently threatened to arrest elected officials across the country, he said, ‘Wait ’til you see what’s coming,'” the governor continued. “Overnight, Republican lawmakers piled on, encouraging the Trump administration to arrest me.” Watch Homan’s comments to reporters: NEW: When asked about Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers telling state officials not to cooperate with ICE, Border Czar Tom Homan seems to signal arrests could be imminent: “Wait until you see what’s coming. I meant what I said.” pic.twitter.com/xJxw5sBVY6 Homan’s thinly veiled threat against Evers and other officials came days after FBI agents arrested Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan on obstruction charges alleging that she helped an undocumented immigrant evade arrest by misdirecting federal authorities. Dugan’s legal team says she is innocent and will be vindicated in court. Evers said Friday that Homan’s threats are “chilling” and “should be of concern to every Wisconsinite and every American who cares about this country and the values we hold dear.” “These threats represent a concerning trajectory in this country,” said Evers. “We now have a federal government that will threaten or arrest an elected official — or even everyday American citizens — who have broken no laws, committed no crimes, and done nothing wrong.” “And as disgusted as I am about the continued actions of the Trump administration, I am not afraid,” he added. “I have never once been discouraged from doing the right thing, and I will not start today.” Watch Evers’ remarks in full: The Wisconsin governor’s full address is transcribed below: The Wisconsin governor’s full address is transcribed below: Good morning, Wisconsin. Governor Tony Evers here. I’m speaking to you today as your governor but also as a concerned American. Yesterday, a Trump administration official, in not so many words, apparently threatened to arrest me for distributing guidance that asked state agency employees to consult with an attorney if federal agents show up at state buildings with legal documents. The goal of this guidance was simple—to provide clear, consistent instructions to state employees and ensure they have a lawyer to help them comply with all federal and state laws. Nothing more, nothing less. But Republicans and their right-wing allies, including Elon Musk, lied about this guidance, spread misinformation, accused me of doing things I didn’t do or say, and fueled a fake controversy of their own creation. Now, I’m used to Republicans and the right wing lying about me. It comes with the job. But, this time, these lies came at a cost. I haven’t broken the law. I haven’t committed a crime. And I’ve never encouraged or directed anyone to break any laws or commit any crimes. But when President Trump’s hand-picked appointee, Tom Homan, was asked about me and this guidance after he apparently threatened to arrest elected officials across the country, he said, “Wait ’til you see what’s coming.” Overnight, Republican lawmakers piled on, encouraging the Trump administration to arrest me. Chilling threats like this should be of concern to every Wisconsinite and every American who cares about this country and the values we hold dear. We live in the United States of America, folks. We are a country of laws. The rule of law matters. Following the law matters. In this country, the federal government doesn’t get to abuse its power to threaten everyday Americans. In this country, the federal government doesn’t get to arrest American citizens who have not committed a crime. In this country, we don’t threaten to persecute people just because they belong to a different political party. These threats represent a concerning trajectory in this country. We now have a federal government that will threaten or arrest an elected official—or even everyday American citizens—who have broken no laws, committed no crimes, and done nothing wrong. And as disgusted as I am about the continued actions of the Trump administration, I am not afraid. I have never once been discouraged from doing the right thing, and I will not start today. I swore an oath when I took this office to support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state of Wisconsin and to faithfully discharge the duties of this office to the best of my ability. I will never waver from that promise. I hope and pray every elected and appointed official in this country, including the president of the United States of America, will do the same. Forward, and for Wisconsin, always. Thank you.
As protests spring up at Tesla dealerships across the country, the company’s profits are plunging. As protests spring up at Tesla dealerships across the country, the company’s profits are plunging. On April 26, protesters outside a Tesla Dealership in Washington, D.C. were elated. That week, Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and head of the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), indicated to shareholders that he would step back from government, allocating a mere “ day or two per week ” toward DOGE projects. In mandatory Securities and Exchange Commission filings and comments to Wall Street analysts, Tesla acknowledged that protests had created a risk factor for the valuation of Tesla stock. “Changing political sentiment,” Tesla wrote in a shareholder report , “could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near term.” In quarterly reports, Tesla reported a 71 percent drop in profits. For protesters, this was a victory a long time in the making. In the opening months of the Trump administration, Musk’s ascendency knew few limits. On his first day in office, Trump conjured DOGE via executive order and placed Musk at the helm, granting him sweeping powers to remake the federal government. Described by Musk as a “ woodchipper for bureaucracy ,” DOGE bulldozed government programs, cancelled contracts and fired career civil servants, often eclipsing the limits of the law and raising questions regarding constitutional separation of powers. During Musk’s tenure, DOGE effectively shuttered USAID , granted young employees access to sensitive Treasury Department payment data, and commandeered the Office of Personnel Management to send emails to every executive branch employee in the government demanding information about their work accomplishments. In mid-April, DOGE attempted to extend its power beyond the government itself into civil society, making a ploy to install government staff within a prominent nonprofit that formerly received federal funding. Faced with limited levers to enact change against an agency commissioned by executive fiat, protesters developed an alternative tactic: attempting to make the Tesla brand sufficiently noxious to strike at Musk’s personal fortune. Musk is currently the richest person in the world, with a plurality of his net worth originating from his shares in Tesla. By protesting at Tesla dealerships across the country, protesters hoped to draw attention to the havoc DOGE has wrought while putting financial pressure on Musk to drop out of government. “Stopping Musk will help save lives and democracy,” the Tesla Takedown website reads . “Sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.” Beginning in February , protesters began to appear at Tesla dealerships across the nation. The protests went viral — and exhibited staying power, recurring week after week. The Tesla Takedown map currently lists upcoming events in 63 localities spread across 23 states. The movement has also spread internationally; Tesla Takedown protests have been held in Canada, the U.K . and across Europe , particularly Germany. In northern Virginia, just outside of Washington, D.C. protesters picket the Tesla dealership three times per week, reliably drawing crowds of 15 to 35 protesters. The Tesla Takedown movement eschews property damage and holds a firm commitment to nonviolence. But in topline rhetoric, Trump officials have drawn connections between the protesters dancing on the sidewalk and the spate of vandalism and arson attacks targeting Tesla vehicles, dealerships and charging locations. In March, FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi signaled that the most serious of these incidents — a shooting through the windows of a Tesla dealership and two arson incidents — qualified, in the government’s eyes, as domestic terrorism. The FBI announced the creation of a dedicated task force, and the Department of justice (DOJ) indicated that the agency would seek 20-year prison sentences for the three accused. The FBI and DOJ have both indicated a willingness to extend investigatory powers beyond arson attacks into minor acts of vandalism and First Amendment-protected protests outside dealerships. In a March public statement, Bondi warned , “If you’re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we’re coming after you.” Michael German, fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program and a former FBI special agent, expressed concern about Bondi’s statements. “Protesting at a Tesla dealership is a lot different than throwing a Molotov cocktail,” he noted in an interview with Truthout . “My concern based on the history would be that they engage in suppressive activities and investigations of people who were merely engaged in organizing protests, rather than engaging in violations of criminal laws.” The FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have all assessed that the most serious criminal actions undertaken against Tesla were likely the work of lone actors. But despite a dearth of evidence linking Tesla arsonists with the Tesla Takedown protest movement, intelligence gathering bodies have disseminated information to local law enforcement encouraging vigilance around nonviolent protests. The Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, a fusion center established after 9/11 to, as it states , “identify, prevent, protect against, mitigate, and assist in the response to and the recovery from the greatest human-made threats and major hazards,” issued a bulletin reading: “Violent opportunists may exploit these gatherings to mask criminal intentions, including vandalism, arson, or other disruptive acts.” The bulletin further notes that “calls to boycott Tesla and protest Elon Musk have also increased.” While fusion centers conduct no investigations of their own, the information they provide can drive investigatory and policing decisions on the ground. “This type of intelligence document is what state, local and federal police use to justify their investigations. So if calls to boycott Tesla are linked to this escalating threats document, then you can imagine that local police might see a local group picketing Tesla as a threat,” German commented. Local police aren’t the only threat protesters must contend with. Since the first Tesla Takedown day of action, InfoWars alum and right-wing activist Laura Loomer has frequented protests in Washington, D.C. posting videos to her large online following. On her X/Twitter account, followed by 1.6 million people, she frequently maligns Tesla pickets as linked to violence. After a minor incident of vandalism at a New York City protest, Loomer threatened to forward the information of protesters associated with one of the protest sponsors, Planet Over Profit, to the Trump administration for use in their domestic terrorism investigation. Coming from a figure with enough cachet in the Trump administration to get six National Security Council advisors fired , some protesters found cause for concern. Less than a week after Loomer published an article about the funders of the Sunrise Movement — another organization involved in Tesla Takedown protests in New York City — Trump echoed her allegations, speculating in public comments that “people that are very highly political on the left” were paying Tesla attackers. But in D.C., protesters show no signs of backing down, either in response to Loomer or to the threat of state surveillance. Instead, they have adopted a strategic exuberance, Mike Kepka, known at the D.C. protests as Captain Beats, told Truthout about the first week of Tesla Takedown protests. “It was a dance party, but no one brought the music,” he recounted. That day, he settled for blasting music out of the open windows of his minivan, but the next week, he came back with real firepower: the AV system he uses for his daughters’ Girl Scout events, complete with boat batteries for power and a Facebook Marketplace-sourced bike trailer. From that week onward, the D.C. contingent of the Tesla Takedown movement rebranded as Dance Against DOGE. As Loomer and her video team continued to make appearances, protesters began adding informational fliers about Dance Against DOGE to the lineup of protest signs. On the flier, the group reiterates its commitment to First Amendment protest and states: “Our fight is with Elon, Trump, and the billionaires, not individual Tesla owners.” As top-level discourse around Tesla protests became increasingly threatening, activists doubled down on creating an atmosphere of joy. They began to don captain’s hats and sparkly attire. “As the weeks have gone on, it’s gotten wilder and wilder,” Dance Against DOGE protest organizer Melissa Knutson recounted. “We have the hats, we have the tinsel boas, we have bubbles. They are on Twitter going, ‘we’re at another Tesla Takedown, and they’re dancing with bubbles.’ It really defuses the whole thing.” Tesla’s profits have plunged and Musk will be reducing his time at DOGE, but protesters aren’t letting up. Knutson pointed out that, even if Musk withdraws from government altogether, Musk’s “minions” at DOGE will continue to slash government jobs and choke funding. And, said Knutson, the protests are about combating the bigger billionaire agenda, and building a resilient resistance movement against the Trump administration writ large. Some local chapters of the Tesla Takedown movement are expanding their activism beyond dealerships into city halls, advocating for local governments to pull Tesla stock from pension portfolios. While this phase of the movement is in its infancy, there are promising signs that divestment resolutions could move forward in some cities and states. In March, 23 members of the New York State Assembly wrote to the state comptroller to advocate divestment of pension funds from Tesla stock. In response to waves of anti-Trump sentiment roiling Canada after the enactment of tariffs, the province of Ontario canceled its contract with Starlink, another of Musk’s companies. Several D.C.-area protesters expressed enthusiasm for initiating divestment resolution campaigns in the suburb of Takoma Park and in Montgomery County. And for the protesters on the streets continuing their crusade outside dealerships, Tesla Takedowns take on a broader resonance: fighting for democracy itself. “We’ve always said this is about getting people comfortable showing up and exercising their rights,” said Knutson. “You can see people walking by who maybe have never protested before, but they’ll join a dance party.” “It’s nonviolent, fun, lets people do something they wouldn’t have done yesterday. If we can do that, maybe we can save democracy,” said Kepka before cueing up the next song. Upon hearing the opening bars of “We’re Not Gonna Take It,” the crowd roared along, tinsel boas glinting in the sun.
Tech writer and critic Paris Marx discusses how Elon Musk is inspiring right-wing efforts abroad. Tech writer and critic Paris Marx discusses the first 100 days of the second Trump administration and the influence of billionaire Elon Musk at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which has slashed government programs and the civil service. Marx says even after Musk gave hundreds of millions to Trump’s reelection campaign, “it was hard to imagine that he would really play this outsized role in the actual governance of the country.” Marx also warns that the DOGE playbook is likely to be exported to “the political right in other countries to try to do something similar with a DOGE organization, kind of wrapping it in this cloak of efficiency and … allowing this further gutting of the state.” Marx also talks about how several Canadian tech executives recently launched the initiative called Build Canada, with the goal of firing 100,000 federal government employees, increasing immigration restrictions and building new oil pipelines, and concern about Musk’s DOGE approach going global. This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: Paris Marx, I also want to ask you about Elon Musk, who you have reported on extensively. As President Trump marked his 100th day in office, The New York Times full-page — full front-page headline , “There Have Never Been 100 Days Like This.” I want to ask you about the role of Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, in Washington over these hundred days. A new Senate report finds Musk and his businesses could avoid over $2 billion in potential legal liability, thanks to cuts Musk enacted as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE. When Trump was inaugurated, Musk was facing up to 65 actions from 11 federal agencies targeting SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink and xAI. Senate Democrats now say Musk has largely averted those actions, thanks to DOGE helping him, quote, “evade oversight, derail investigations, and make litigation disappear whenever he so chooses — on his terms and at his command.” Paris Marx, tell us more. PARIS MARX: Yeah, it has been a really stunning hundred days, and even the period before that, right? Before Trump came to power, was reelected, you could see that Elon Musk was already making the shift to the right globally, you know, by supporting other extreme right-wing parties, and then, of course, to get publicly behind Donald Trump, to give hundreds of millions of dollars to support his campaign. But I think even then, it was hard to imagine that he would really play this outsized role in the actual governance of the country — right? — heading up this agency that seemed to have such broad power, to start going into these various different departments and agencies of the U.S. government, remaking it, laying people off, forcing decisions on it. And what we have seen as part of that is, you know, this ability for Elon Musk to use this kind of profile that he has as this tech leader, this tech genius, regardless of whether that’s true or not, to come in and kind of help legitimize this right-wing program that we had seen in the making for quite some time — right? — through Project 2025 and the larger kind of Heritage Foundation and these other right-wing groups in their ambitions. But then, beyond that, you know, as you were saying there, one of the key pieces of this was not just to lay a lot of people off, to kill certain departments or significantly reduce the capacities of others, but also to ensure that what comes out on the other side of this is much more beneficial to Elon Musk, specifically, and some parts of the tech industry, more broadly, with the rollout of Starlink in many different agencies, the gutting of regulators who were looking into Elon Musk’s businesses. And we see that, you know, a section of the tech industry wants to really see a remaking of not just the aerospace industry, but military procurement, as well. And I think that we’re starting to see changes in that space, too. So, it has been a really significant hundred days. Obviously, there’s talk now about whether Elon Musk is going to continue. He’s talked about reducing the amount of time he spends there to two days a week. But even then, two days a week is quite a lot of time to cause a lot of havoc. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And this issue of Musk’s DOGE is not just centered in the United States, per se . You’ve reported, for instance, that several Canadian tech executives recently launched the initiative Build Canada. The website lists as its goals building more pipelines, firing over 100,000 federal workers in Canada and increasing immigration restrictions. What do you see as the possibility of this approach of dismantling the liberal democratic state going global? PARIS MARX: Yeah, so, I think it is a serious worry, right? We often see things that happen, say, in the United States eventually get exported to other parts of the world. And I would not be surprised if something — if there’s not a push from the political right in other countries to try to do something similar with a DOGE organization, kind of wrapping it in this kind of cloak of efficiency and the use of technology and things like that, but actually allowing this further gutting of the state, based on what we’ve seen over the past number of decades already, right? And so, in Canada, we have seen tech executives explicitly say that they want to see a DOGE. It’s interesting, actually. The head of Build Canada in the past few weeks came out and said, “No, our goal is not to build a DOGE,” recognizing how that term and that notion had been so toxified based on what was happening in the United States. But that didn’t also stop a number of prominent Conservatives at a recent Conservative conference in Canada to actually talk about how it would be easier to roll out a DOGE in Canada. And there was even an executive from Amazon there, a senior public policy person, who was explaining how Amazon and other cloud services could be used to collect a lot of data on government that would aid in this process of deciding which parts of the government, which programs should be eliminated, which I think is a very worrying relationship to see, not just with these Canadian tech executives. But people from a major company like Amazon being part of these conversations in Canada probably shows, you know, still how close this relationship between parts of the tech industry and the right wing are, especially when it comes to these efforts. AMY GOODMAN: Paris Marx, we want to thank you for being with us, host of the podcast Tech Won’t Save Us . We’ll link to your latest article in your newsletter Disconnect , “Canada’s tech executives aren’t scared of Mark Carney.” And we’ll link to your four-part podcast , Elon Musk Unmasked . Next up, today is the 50th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. We’ll speak to the Pulitzer Prize-winning Vietnamese American writer Viet Thanh Nguyen about Vietnam, Trump’s first 100 days and more. Stay with us. AMY GOODMAN: “Black Waters,” folk musicians Nora Brown and Stephanie Coleman performing in our Democracy Now! studio. They joined us in March to talk about their recent appearance at the Kennedy Center where they unfurled banners to protest President Trump’s takeover of the famed cultural institution. They played at the Kennedy Center the night that the vice president, Vice President Vance, was booed there.
The info the staffers reportedly have access to could “damage or harm national security” if leaked, one source said. Two members of the Trump administration’s so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) have been granted unusual access to classified networks that house U.S. government information regarding nuclear weapons. Sources speaking to NPR say that former SpaceX intern Luke Farritor and venture capitalist Adam Ramada, both members of Elon Musk’s DOGE program, have accounts on two networks relating to the government’s nuclear secrets. The sources note that Farritor and Ramada’s names are included on a list of people who have had accounts created for them in order to access that information. This in itself is not proof that they’ve directly seen nuclear secrets, a point that spokespersons for the government have stated in order to discredit the report. But it is the first step toward accessing such information, which can only be viewed in a secure room. “They’re getting a little further in, it’s something to make note of. It could lead to something bigger,” one source familiar with the matter told NPR . Farritor and Ramada are listed as account holders allowed access to the National Nuclear Security Administration’s (NNSA) Enterprise Secure Network (ESN), which is “responsible for transmitting restricted data about America’s nuclear weapons designs and the special nuclear materials used.” Through ESN, information is sent from nuclear labs to production facilities “that store, maintain, and upgrade the country’s nuclear arsenal,” The Daily Beast reported . The DOGE duo has also been granted access to the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, which the Department of Defense (DOD) uses to discuss nuclear weapons with the Department of Energy (DOE). Access to those networks requires a “Q” level government clearance status , the highest level of security clearance that exists at the DOE. Typically, obtaining that status is a lengthy process, but it can be expedited in certain circumstances. Neither Farritor nor Ramada has any experience, prior to working for DOGE, with handling classified information, let alone information relating to nuclear weapons. A DOE spokesperson initially denied that Farritor and Ramada have access to the secured networks. That person later amended their statement to NPR , saying that accounts had been created for the two DOGE employees but had not been used. A former career DOD civil servant told the publication that if the information were somehow leaked (either purposely or by mistake), it could have devastating consequences, “potentially damag or harm national security.” The new reports detailing the DOGE workers’ access to the country’s nuclear secrets comes as recent polling shows that most voters are skeptical that the “department” is carrying out its purported function of cutting waste and rooting out fraud. According to a new Washington Post / ABC News /Ipsos poll , while 43 percent of Americans believe that waste has decreased due to DOGE and the Trump administration, a majority of voters, 56 percent, hold the opposite viewpoint, with 31 percent saying that waste has stayed the same and 25 percent saying it has actually increased since Donald Trump returned to the White House. The same holds true for voters’ views on fraud — only 32 percent think that the administration has decreased fraud in the government, while 34 percent say the levels of fraud have remained the same. Another 34 percent say fraud has increased, for a combined total of 68 percent of respondents saying that fraud has not decreased as promised.
“What’s happening in Memphis is a human rights violation,” says KeShaun Pearson of Memphis Community Against Pollution. Image Credit: USA TODAY Network via Reuters Connect We speak with two brothers who are fighting Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI over its massive data center in Memphis, Tennessee, used to run its chatbot Grok. The facility is next to historically Black neighborhoods and is powered by 35 pollution-spewing methane gas turbines the company is using without legal permits. Musk says he wants to continue expanding the project. “What’s happening in Memphis is a human rights violation,” says KeShaun Pearson, executive director of the environmental justice organization Memphis Community Against Pollution. “Elon Musk and xAI are violating our human right to clean air and a clean, healthy environment.” His brother Justin J. Pearson, a Tennessee state representative for Memphis, says Musk is “perpetuating environmental racism” by ignoring the wishes of local residents: “They are abusing our community, and they’re exploiting us.” This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman. We end today’s show in Memphis, Tennessee, where Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company X, now called xAI, opened a massive data center, known as Colossus, last year that supports the chatbot Grok. The facility is next to historically Black neighborhoods and runs on 35 methane gas-powered turbine generators, which emit significant amounts of nitrogen oxide and other toxic chemicals. The Southern Environmental Law Center says the turbines are operating without a permit. Those permits are the focus of a Shelby County Health Department hearing taking place today, Friday, as Musk says he wants to continue to expand his project. In February, Elon Musk explained why he decided to build Colossus in Memphis. ELON MUSK: Well, we needed a building. We can’t build a building, so we must use an existing building. So we looked for — basically, for factories that had been — that had been abandoned, but the factory was in good shape, like a company had gone bankrupt or something. So, we found an Electrolux factory in Memphis. That’s why it’s in Memphis, home of Elvis and also one of the oldest — I think it was the capital of ancient Egypt. AMY GOODMAN: This is Tennessee state Representative Justin J. Pearson, a Democrat who represents Memphis. REP. JUSTIN J. PEARSON: xAI, Elon Musk’s company, is operating 35 gas turbines in southwest Memphis, in the neighborhood where myself and my entire family lives. This is horrific news. They are increasing the amount of nitrogen dioxide, which causes smog and continues to harm people with asthma, by potentially 30 to 60%. AMY GOODMAN: For more, we are joined in Memphis, Tennessee, by state Representative Justin J. Pearson and his brother KeShaun Pearson, executive director of Memphis Community Against Pollution. We welcome you both to Democracy Now! KeShaun, let’s begin with you, as you’re quoted all over about what’s happening in your community, Memphis, Tennessee, where Dr. King was assassinated April 4th, 1968; Memphis, Tennessee, where Elon Musk wants to build — is trying to expand Colossus. Explain what’s happening and the community response and what you’re planning to say today at the health department hearing. KESHAUN PEARSON: What’s happening in Memphis is a human rights violation. Elon Musk and xAI are violating our human right to clean air and a clean, healthy environment. Today I plan to address the Shelby County Health Department in stating that this has not been a transparent process, this has been done in a clandestine way, and this is not the way that we can move forward healthily for our community. We need justice in processing. We need justice in the process. We need redress and repair. We don’t need continual pollution. We’ve seen this story before, where polluters come to our city, whether it has been TVA in their Valero plant, sterilization services in their ethylene oxide plant. We have continued to be looked at as the path of least resistance. Today I will make and explain to our Shelby County Health Department that we are not the path of least resistance. We are a resilient community that deserves the human rights of clean air, clean water, clean soil and a healthy environment. We should not continue to bear the burden of the negative health impacts of this facility and its rapid pace and movement. A phrase and a term coined by Leah Thomas, “environmental intersectionalism” — AMY GOODMAN: Let me ask you — KESHAUN PEARSON: — explains how Black — yeah, sure. AMY GOODMAN: I want to ask you, Elon Musk claims he chose the former Electrolux building in Memphis because he wanted to get his AI applications up as fast as possible, within 122 days. He decided to use the abandoned building instead of a brand-new one. Can you talk about what Electrolux was before the process it took for Musk’s company xAI to purchase the building? KESHAUN PEARSON: Electrolux was a company that scammed the city of Memphis. Electrolux came to our city and promised jobs, promised prosperity, similar to what xAI is doing, and then they left. They left without fulfilling the promise of jobs. They left without fulfilling the tax — the tax recommendations and the taxes that they said that they would provide that would elevate our community. They made promises, and then they left and abandoned us. This is the same process that we’ve seen Elon Musk do in Texas, as well as California. He will create a plan, and then he will leave. And so, what we’re seeing right now is that this continual process is continuing to happen with a new tenant. Electrolux provided him the facility, and he is scamming the city of Memphis while putting out pollution. AMY GOODMAN: KeShaun, I want to introduce your brother. This is an interesting inside-outside strategy. Tennessee Democratic state Representative Justin J. Pearson of Memphis, well known to people around the country. The two Justins, the representatives who were forced out of the Legislature, then reelected back in by their communities, Justin J. Pearson representing Memphis. Justin, thank you so much for being with us, state representative. If you can talk about your opposition to Elon Musk and xAI? Very interesting that your fellow Republicans, who have a supermajority in the Tennessee state House, recently passed a resolution recognizing Musk as, quote, “a brilliant businessman who’s saving lives and helping to restore America as a valuable ally of Donald J. Trump.” Talk about your concerns about what this AI data center will mean. REP. JUSTIN J. PEARSON: Yeah, look, my concern is that Elon Musk is buying and paying for access to pollute, harm and hurt our community. Unfortunately, our mayors and elected officials and appointed officials — Mayor Lee Harris, Mayor Paul Young, Shelby County Health Director Michelle Taylor — and the Greater Memphis Chamber all decided that the community of 38109, where I live, could be on the auction block for Elon Musk to buy. And it is a horrible, horrendous project that is having serious ramifications for our community. The reason that in legislation that my colleagues passed praising Elon Musk I put several amendments was to tell the truth, that Elon Musk is polluting the air of Tennesseans. He is continuing and perpetuating environmental racism and environmental degradation in our community. This project is an application for 15 gas turbines, but we know today that they have 35 turbines, and yesterday a report showed 33 of those in operation, despite the fact that the mayor of Memphis said only 15 of them were being used, because that’s what xAI had told him. They are liars. They are abusing our community, and they are exploiting us, and it’s having horrible ramifications — 17.2 tons of formaldehyde being sprayed into our air because of these gas turbines, over 130 tons of nitrogen oxide, making them a larger polluter than the Memphis International Airport. It’s happening right now in our community. And elected officials and appointed officials have a responsibility to the people who they were elected and appointed to serve, not to the billionaires and the oligarchs who are misusing and abusing their authority to hurt our community. AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about Memphis Mayor Paul Young, after public pressure mounted, offering to earmark a portion of the roughly $15 million in tax proceeds from xAI’s operation? REP. JUSTIN J. PEARSON: Yeah, I mean, Mayor Young’s idea that he’s going to give us tax money in place of our health and our lives is completely asinine, and it’s an insult to the people in this community. But it isn’t just Mary Young who is problematic. It’s Mayor Lee Harris of Shelby County, who has said nothing about this project since it started, and he was all praise and all happy-go-lucky about it, and now we can’t find him. He’s entirely invisible, despite the fact that the health department is under his purview. And so, he hasn’t come out with a statement saying that we need to protect our air, we need to protect our citizens, we need to protect our community. And that is giving license to Elon Musk and to xAI that they can pollute our community, they can hurt us, without any ramification. But the people power that is rising up, the democracy that is being shown here by people of all constituencies, people all across our district, in District 86, but all across this city and this county, is showing that we are not going to yield to the anti-democratic, anti-constitutional actions of people. We are not going to yield our lives and our lungs to Elon Musk, to Paul Young, to Lee Harris, to Michelle Taylor. We are not yielding our lives for the profits of the richest man in the world. This is ridiculous that the Greater Memphis Chamber and so many other people have literally decided that we can be sacrificed for the benefits of a data center and a supercomputer, and we not be included in the process, our voices not be heard. That isn’t the way that economic development is supposed to go. And if that is the way that economic development needs to go in our city, we don’t want it. It’s an insult to the people in Boxtown, in Westwood, in West Junction, in Walker Homes, in Coro Lake that we are being treated this way, and that the people who have a responsibility and an obligation to do something about it are refusing to do so. AMY GOODMAN: Democratic state Representative Justin J. Pearson, I wanted to extend my condolences on your baby brother’s death, not such a baby anymore, took his own life in December. And I understand, going back in time, when Tim was born, he needed a machine to breathe. KeShaun, when he was born, was born premature. Can you, first, talk about what you feel this all has to do with, communities that have cancer clusters and are in environmentally really fragile shape as a result of pollution? REP. JUSTIN J. PEARSON: Absolutely. So, KeShaun and I lost my middle brother, his baby brother, younger brother, Tim Pearson, in December, and we miss him every single day, one of the reasons that it’s so important that we do something about this gun violence epidemic. And he was a proponent and a super advocate in our community and would have been at this public hearing today fighting alongside of us, as well, but he’s with us in spirit, for sure. But he was born with asthma, my oldest brother born prematurely. My uncle sleeps with a CPAP machine. My auntie is currently fighting cancer, breast cancer, right now, and the same type of breast cancer that my grandmother died from. We know that environmental injustice is having a serious impact on the very lives and the health of the people in our communities. And these issues are interconnected. It is no coincidence that 75% — if you are Black, African American in this country, you’re 75% more likely to live near a toxic hazardous waste facility. It’s no accident that in this district, in this community, we’re four times likelier to have cancer in our bodies. It’s no accident that in this community there are over 17 Toxics Release Inventory facilities surrounding us — now 18 with Elon Musk’s xAI plant. It is a consistent practice that is a part of the history of our country, to first redline communities, force people to live in certain areas, and if you look at those same maps and where industrial facilities are being placed, they overlap. Our communities are being targeted. None of this is accidental or coincidental. We are being targeted, and our lives are continuously and consistently being hurt and harmed by the actions of corporations and by leaders like the Greater Memphis Chamber, Mayor Young, Mayor Harris, Director Taylor, who are not stepping up to the plate to say, “You know what? We do need to find out more information about the environmental consequences before we greenlight projects like this.” And if I can say this, look, when you look at — AMY GOODMAN: And we just have 20 seconds. REP. JUSTIN J. PEARSON: Oh, go ahead. Look, we have to fight. That is our responsibility. Fight, because clean air is a human right. AMY GOODMAN: That’s Tennessee Democratic state Representative Justin J. Pearson, who’s holding a news conference today at 4:30 in Memphis. And I want to thank KeShaun Pearson, executive director of Memphis Community Pollution. We will continue to follow this story. Democracy Now! currently accepting applications for an individual giving manager to support our fundraising team. Check it out at democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman. Thanks so much for joining us.
Sarah Kendzior discusses the Trump administration’s politics of disposability and the movement towards authoritarianism. Television personality Mehmet Oz was sworn in Friday as the new administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In his remarks, Oz stressed the need to reduce chronic illness, declaring, “It is the patriotic duty of all Americans to take care of themselves. It’s important for serving in the military, but it’s also important because healthy people don’t consume healthcare resources.” This dehumanizing, ableist framing — which blames individuals for the conditions that make them dependent on medical care — is in keeping with the broader eugenic overtones of this administration. We’ve heard similar rhetoric before, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s false claim that “If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease in modern times.” These narratives are designed to justify the abandonment of anyone deemed at fault for their health challenges or too “flawed” to deserve care. This administration’s politics of disposability often bring to mind the words of my friend Sarah Kendzior, who wrote : “When wealth is passed off as merit, bad luck is seen as bad character. This is how ideologues justify punishing the sick and the poor. But poverty is neither a crime nor a character flaw. Stigmatize those who let people die, not those who struggle to live.” Sarah is the author of the bestselling books The View From Flyover Country , Hiding in Plain Sight , and They Knew . I am currently reading Sarah’s latest book, The Last American Road Trip , which feels like a long and thoughtful conversation with an old friend. I recently caught up with Sarah to talk about her new book, the mess we’re in, and how we can hold onto our humanity in these times. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Kelly Hayes: This is a pretty bleak moment in U.S. politics. As someone who has studied authoritarian governments around the world and chronicled the progression of the mafia state here in the United States, how would you describe our present situation? Sarah Kendzior: This is as bleak as I have seen it, and I realize that every time you ask me this question, that is my response. That’s because we’ve been headed for this culmination for a very long time. I’ve been warning about Trump specifically for a decade, and before that I was warning about the conditions that allowed him to even be a “legitimate” candidate for office in the first place, despite his history. This institutional rot, deep-seated corruption, the flow of dark money through everything — and now we’ve reached a point where there’s no pretense of attempting to make this a democracy. There’s no pretense of officials being responsive to the people that they serve. Institutions are folding very quickly, obeying authoritarian whims and all of that. It’s very hard to see because the end result is mass suffering and it’s the suffering of people who are already vulnerable. Those are the targets. Within that, though, I am glad to see there are people fighting back. I think often the people who are fighting the most, we hear from the least, because they’re fighting a strategic battle. There are a lot of places, especially where I live in Missouri, where we’ve been accustomed to these kind of laws and this kind of harassment and oppression from the government for a very long time, and people have learned how to operate in a stealthy way, and I don’t even mean things like protests or things like that, but mutual aid and communities reaching out to each other, providing information to each other, stuff like that. So it’s still there, but I think the fact that it has to remain somewhat hidden gives people the impression that there’s less of a resistance than there is. And I think in general, people, while feeling beaten down, still are willing to fight for what we have left, because it does mean so much to them, and they now see the magnitude of this potential loss. What are you most worried about right now? Oh my god, such a long list. I have a lot of nightmare situations in my head about the long-term direction where they’re going. One of them is the surveillance state and the role of technology. Within that state, the ability of the government and corporations and tech companies to merge in a such a way that you are being spied upon, and if you express certain beliefs or sentiments, your ability to travel, get a job, get a loan or use basic facilities could be compromised — something akin to China’s social credit system. That’s one thing I’m worried about, because they are headed in that direction. The open insertion of people like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, et cetera, is I think a dire attribute of this administration that wasn’t quite as explicit in the previous one. I’m very worried about pushes for partition. I’ve been talking about that for a long time. The model that this administration has always embraced has been the collapse of the Soviet Union and the aftermath of that collapse in the 1990s, where a lot of oligarchs basically saw what was left of the Soviet Union, particularly the authoritarian states that were once republics and became independent states, as just land masses to strip down and sell off for parts. You see this obviously in Russia, but it happened in Azerbaijan and elsewhere. It’s a lot easier for somebody to carry out a plan like that if a country is divided into pieces, which is why we’ve heard a lot of like, oh, “the South should just secede,” that kind of rhetoric. If the United States falls apart, if it falls into separate regions, or Texas or California or another large state leaves, that will make this enormously easier for the oligarchs’ agenda and goals. And I hope that folks see through that. What you’re saying about surveillance makes me think about the push to end so-called “information silos” within the federal government, like the push to merge IRS data with DHS data, for the purpose of hunting down immigrants. Under the banner of reducing supposed fraud and waste, and increasing efficiency, DOGE is trying to centralize information in ways that will create a kind of digital panopticon. And there are just so many things happening, and so many immediate concerns, like the way this decentralization will harm undocumented people, that I think a lot of people are missing the long game. As you’ve said, this information being centralized within the government, as the government partners up with tech oligarchs, is setting up a system where we are all under a microscope, and can be targeted in any number of ways, at any given time. If you think about the way Elon Musk talks about people who aren’t part of his chosen elite, calling people “NPC” — it’s a kind of dehumanization. Every fascism has its subhumans, and for Elon Musk, generally speaking, humans are subhumans, because life is a video game, and if you’re not one of the people driving the game forward, you are a nothing and a nobody, and the game should be hacked in ways that make you easier to control. And as far as partition goes, I think what they’re really setting the stage for, with this agenda of withholding funds for things like disaster relief, is to create zones of vulnerability and desperation where corporate forces can come in and billionaires can “rescue” a place in particular ways, in exchange for really taking over the area. That’s something I have been expecting for a long time. I think that’s how Curtis Yarvin’s “patchwork” of corporate fiefdoms managed by monarch-CEOs happens, if it does happen. It happens through organized abandonment and privatization at the scale of a kind of mini nation-building. And to me, that kind of corporate usurpation feels really plausible under this administration, if it accomplishes as much of its agenda as it would like to. Absolutely. And this is a very long-term goal. A long-term plan influenced, I think, by what happened in the aftermath of the Soviet Union. But we’ve been on this road since Reagan and even before. And one of the biggest warning signs for me when Biden took office was the Postal Service — the fact that Biden did not fire DeJoy. There seemed to be this ongoing move to privatize or destroy the U.S. Postal Service. And so I watched, during the last four years, this abandonment of key U.S. institutions that do things for the public good. I don’t think Trump’s second term would’ve kicked off the way it did if so many hadn’t been placated during the four-year interval, where they accepted a lot of things during that four-year time that they never would’ve accepted under Trump. I mean, we just explicitly saw that. There were mass protests during Trump’s term. Under Biden, a lot of these same actions, abuse of immigrants and migrants, for example, were taking place. The facilitation of genocide was taking place. And if you criticized it, people who would applaud you for criticizing it under Trump would get very angry at you, like, “How dare you? It’s the Democrats that will save us.” I wish that there is a more thorough examination of what has happened in the last four years, both within the Biden administration, but also among the right wing behind the scenes, because often they were just openly planning this. You had people like Christopher Rufo confessing plans. You don’t get a gulag for Americans in El Salvador out of the blue. People worked behind the scenes to make that happen. We had Trump’s first term as a template, and we knew their ambitions and they wrote them down. Why was there no effort made to plan against it? What will we do if Trump is reinstalled and they take power to ward all this off? And the thing that frightens me is that I think a lot of Democratic officials or others in our institutions just are fine with it or had no inclination to try to ward it off. That, or the denial was so deep that people thought, oh, it’ll come for others, but it won’t come for me. I’m at Harvard, or one of those other elite spaces. And I’m not trying to rag on people who might have just gotten fired or lost their grants. We’re seeing a lot of really horrific things happen to innocent people within these institutions. And of course among them are the international students, who are being unlawfully detained, deported, having their civil rights violated. But I think that a lot of these big power brokers, they thought they were somehow above all of this, but no one really is. It is a tiny little group of people, just the ones you’ve said that want to invent these city states, where everything is technologically connected and monitored and everyone is surveilled and made into some kind of ideal subject. And I think this correlates with the rise of AI and its replacement of human creativity, which they’re desperate to stamp out. They want to stamp out human creativity and they want to stamp out accurate history. They want us to forget our own humanity, to surrender our humanity and to not know what it means to be a human being. Because if we feel less human, if we see ourselves that way, if we see other people that way, then we’re more willing to accept the idea that certain people are disposable. And that’s the main idea that they’re trying to bring home now. But they’ve been, I mean, my god, they’ve been trying to normalize that since the dawn of this country. But there’s been quite an uptick in this dehumanization, in recent history, including eugenicist rhetoric, since about 2022 — the backlash to a lot of the big movements of 2020, and also a backlash to a lot of the COVID precautions. A lot of people are traumatized and misinformed. Some people see a powerful movement forming, and they feel like they would rather be on the side of power. They would rather feel like they are among the powerful than among the targeted. It’s a classic trajectory towards authoritarianism, and unfortunately it’s one that we’ve seen in our country in the past, collectively practiced. And now, the net has been widened and it includes almost everyone in terms of who they are seeking to capture. Every day I get messages from people who are frightened and strategizing around their safety or the safety of their community, or trying to figure out how their organization can survive what’s coming. A lot of people are shaken and hurting. I told a friend yesterday that more and more often I feel sick after a long stretch of reading. And that feels significant to me, because I have been reading about a lot of disturbing stuff for a very long time. What advice do you have for people who are trying to hold themselves together emotionally right now? It’s very hard. I’ve been studying these things my whole life. This is what I studied getting a PhD before I moved back into journalism — totalitarian and authoritarian states. And so I’m used to reading about these very dire things. Then I’ve read about them in a U.S. context, and I’ve warned of their impending rise for the last decade. But that doesn’t make any difference in terms of how it feels emotionally. It digs away at your soul. It digs away at your stamina, your ability to be resolute, because what you’re watching is just mass human suffering. You’re watching people suffering at scale, and you’re watching people suffering individually, and then you yourself are also suffering as a target of it. If you have elderly parents, you’re worried about Social Security. If you have kids in public school, you’re worried that they’re going to close. If you have a disability, you’re terrified of what the government is going to do under RFK Jr. And the fact that we’ve had this attack on empathy over the last three to four years, where they’ve really tried to normalize a lot of cruel and dehumanizing behavior, I think it makes people feel abandoned and alone, I think to some extent, because people have been encouraged to abandon others. So I guess, what I’d say here is: I think everyone is feeling this. There is a sense of separation and isolation. Even social media has splintered. But more than that, I think there’s a level of self-censorship, of internal censorship, that wasn’t there before. And particularly, people might not want to express the pain of the moment, because that pain is a vulnerability, and you don’t want to give your opponent a sense of what your vulnerabilities are when you know you may be a target of political persecution. That, and you also just don’t want to be subject to the cruelty of other people, who feel like they need to weigh in on what is a sincerely devastating emotional time. And so I don’t take breaks from the news per se, but I’ve always made a point of just getting offline for hours at a time each day. I do a lot of crafts. I do a lot of stuff outside. I’ve been making a lot of things. I do all sorts of textile work like embroidery and weaving and basket making and stuff. As this administration came in, I kept doing it more and more and wondering, why am I spending so much time making a basket out of pine needles? But then I keep thinking, I’ve made something. I’ve made something that’s beautiful, it didn’t exist before, and now I’ve made it and now it’s there. And now I can give it to someone, and that person will be happy. They’ll have a little surprise in their day. It’s a small thing, but I’ve been sort of clinging to that. It’s just a mode of behavior — just trying to bring things that are beautiful into the world, give them to others, check in on others, and just value the time we have with friends, family, and our community. I’ve also been looking out for what is happening to my community in particular, because I am very worried about the defunding of public services and of schools, and what will happen to vulnerable people. I live in a state and a city that is already impoverished in a lot of ways, and that has long been a target of extreme right wing governance. In fact, Missouri is the state where they experimented and tested a lot of these policies. So we’re experienced, but like I said, that doesn’t take away the pain of it. So I guess, I don’t know whether it’s reassuring or not to know you’re not alone in your pain, because obviously it’s not reassuring to feel this level of pain. But I find it reassuring. I’d rather we were all happy together, but I’m glad that a lot of people still feel compassion. When you see that people are upset because they feel compassion for those who are targeted and those who are detained or deported or whose rights are being stripped away, that shows a refusal to give up. It shows a refusal to give in. So even if it just feels like a scream of desperation, when you’re still feeling that, you’re expressing that it means you still care. And if you still care, then I think there’s still potential for this situation to be turned around. If people refuse to surrender their humanity, I think that we are still able to fight back. We might not win, but we can continue to fight. And sometimes that’s the more important thing. I really appreciate what you’re saying about compassion, and how the pain we feel when people are suffering is tied to our humanity, which is something we have to cling to and fight for in these times. I don’t think enough people recognize how the normalization of human suffering and disposability happen. When you stop caring about any group of people and their suffering, you lose part of your humanity, and you also become more vulnerable to the violence they’re experiencing. In this country, we’ve done that with imprisoned people for generations — and a willingness to ignore that system and those conditions has left people susceptible to violence they’ve learned to ignore. Now, Republicans and a lot of Democratic officials want us to stop caring what happens to immigrants, and to trans people, and to just throw more and more people under the bus, and eventually, the more you accept this, you’re just not a person who values or defends life anymore. Life is not precious to you. You have dehumanized others and yourself, and now everyone is disposable, and you are part of that culture. This is how that happens. And we have to rage against that. All of this talk about political expediency is just expediting the loss of our humanity. The fascists want us to be consumed by self-preservation and self-concern alone, because that leaves us weak and isolated. That’s what empowers them. Our political potential is grounded in solidarity, now and always. Now, let’s talk about your new book, The Last American Road Trip: A Memoir . I have been reading this book and I absolutely love it. It’s beautifully written, which is no surprise. When you talk about the Mississippi River and Mark Twain, weaving in so much history and political analysis, I really feel like I am on these road trips with you, having these conversations in a car or in a canoe. Can you talk about why you wanted to write this book and what you hope people get out of it? Well, what I hope people get out of it is a desire to protect the places and people of America during this terrible time. It’s a book that I wrote about taking my children all around the U.S. on the road to see national parks, historic sites, interesting places — starting at around 2016, going up to 2024 — because I was very worried that these places were going to be destroyed, either through political force or by climate change. And I wanted my kids to experience this country through their own eyes, not through some sort of lecture by me or some sort of memory by association, but directly. And the beautiful thing about driving, especially when you live in Missouri, when you live in the center of it all, is that you see the landscape change, you interact with all sorts of different people. You see that this is a tremendously diverse country, and that’s why it’s, I think, the most interesting place to live in the world. Really seeing a place has the power to destroy stereotypes and generalizations before they even begin. And it was important for me as a mom, for my kids to have that kind of experience, to stay curious, to stay open-minded, and they are. In that regard, my efforts succeeded. But of course, the book gets released now . I wrote it in 2023. It’s getting released as there is an open attack on things like national parks. And so I think it reads differently now than it did six months ago. There were some advanced reviews where people thought I was being too pessimistic or maybe too hypervigilant, and I obviously was not. But that breaks my heart. I want very badly to be wrong. I’ve wanted to be wrong the whole time. My theory in taking these trips was like, well, if I’m wrong, we just get a lot of awesome vacations out of this, and that’s a good thing. But I am glad that I wrote it down because the other crazy thing with this book is that there are a lot of stories of American history in it that would undoubtedly be censored under this government’s so-called anti-DEI strategy, where they basically try to erase anybody who’s not white from American history. So if I’m writing something that should be a fairly factual and benign historical tale like about the man who first mapped a Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, who was an enslaved Black man, that individual is going to be erased from the websites and official narratives of American history. I mean, that doesn’t mean it’s going to get erased in general, but I’m glad I wrote this when I did. I also really needed to get away from writing these very, very dark books about political corruption. I wanted to write about what I love and what I’m fighting for and what I value — a lot of which is my family and nature. It’s a lot of simple things that are part of everyday life that are in danger of being taken away. And for those wondering about this, yes, this is still my kind of book. I did take my kids to the airport where there was drug smuggling for Iran-Contra. So there are some things in there that are similar to my other books as well — lots of field trips for the kids. But I needed to write something more personal because I felt like we’d reached a point where I’d said everything I could kind of say about the broad scope of political corruption and impending doom. I wanted to write about what mattered. And one thing that was subconscious, I guess, but it kind of chills me, is often in countries where authoritarianism has tightened its grip, you see journalists who had been covering things in a less personal way revert to the personal. Anna Politkovskaya in Russia began to do that. And she began to say that feelings are the most important thing, because her entire chronology of time in her head had become jumbled from living under the early years of Vladimir Putin. But she knew that what she felt, her love, her protectiveness of the victims of that government, those things were real and they couldn’t be taken away. They could only be surrendered. You could only surrender your compassion or your imagination or your tenacity. They can’t take those things from you. And so I think some of that seeps into the book. I wanted to find things that no one could take from me, whether they were personal attributes or just physical places that my children could see. Things like being able to see the Milky Way — these sorts of collective experiences that mankind had until very recently, when industrialization stole them. And I didn’t intend for this to happen, but the last National Park we visited in the book was Death Valley. And we were out on the dunes looking up in the Milky Way, and then suddenly our vision of it was marred by Starlink, just slithering along. And so this shared moment of communing with nature was interrupted by the creations of Elon Musk. I didn’t know when I experienced that, or wrote it down, how that moment would resonate now. I hope that this book shows people things that are worth fighting for, and that we can find beauty in the wreckage, and should take nothing for granted. Is there anything else you would like to share with or ask of our readers today? Just know that it is normal to feel the pain and despair that you may be feeling now. Don’t let people lecture you about it, but also don’t give up on yourself, and don’t give up on other people. Because I don’t think that we are in a hopeless situation, I think it’s just going to take an incredible reservoir of strength, and that locating that strength within yourself can be difficult. But I think that whatever way you find it, which I think is unique to every person, try to get there, because we need you. If anyone is making you feel like you’re disposable or that your humanity can be debated, disregard that entirely. We need you here. Organizing My Thoughts is a reader-supported newsletter.

“This message will serve as your only warning,” stated a memo from Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s chief of staff. This story was originally published by ProPublica. A top official in the Department of Labor this week informed all staff members that they could face criminal charges if they speak to journalists, former employees or others about agency business. A memo sent Monday by Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s chief of staff, Jihun Han, and obtained by ProPublica , states that “individuals who disclose confidential information or engage in unauthorized communications with the media may face serious legal consequences.” Among the ramifications, the memo states, are “potential criminal penalties, depending on the nature of the information and the applicable laws,” and “immediate disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.” The guidance document went on to say that “any unauthorized communication with the media,” regardless of what information is shared or how it is shared, “will be treated as a serious offense.” The memo listed laws, regulations and a departmental guide to explain its legal position. Among them was a regulation concerning civil servants’ ethical obligations and a law, the Freedom of Information Act, guaranteeing the public the right to inspect certain public records. “This message will serve as your only warning,” the memo stated. The warning comes as current and former Labor Department employees have spoken to the news media about harms they see resulting from the dismantling of portions of their agency , which enforces laws guaranteeing rights to a safe workplace, fair pay and protections against discrimination. “It’s very chilling,” a Labor Department employee who requested anonymity for fear of retribution told ProPublica . “It’s never a good look when you’re telling people to never talk about what you’re doing.” Labor Department spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “These types of missives can chill the free flow of information to the press and the public,” said Gabe Rottman, vice president of policy at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. “That’s a concern.” Civil servants do not sacrifice their First Amendment rights by accepting a job with the federal government, but there do exist higher restrictions on what information they can disclose publicly. Government agencies that handle classified information have on rare occasions launched criminal investigations against leakers, but those are typically invoked only when leaks involve classified national security intelligence or protected financial information, Rottman said. “But normally, disclosures to the press or others would be a matter of employee discipline as opposed to carrying criminal sanctions,” he said. While the memo raising the possibility of criminal penalties was sent to Labor Department employees, it reflects a common approach by the administration of President Donald Trump to guard against federal government employees speaking to reporters. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, for example, has publicly announced an aggressive pursuit of leakers. Elon Musk, who launched the Department of Government Efficiency, which is at the heart of the shake-up of the federal government, has bragged about his tactics in rooting out leaks at his companies. And Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has blamed alleged leaks by former Pentagon staffers for reigniting controversy over his use of the Signal messaging app to discuss military operations. Federal employees at various agencies told ProPublica that an air of suspicion has descended on their workplace during Trump’s second term, with rumors flying of surveillance of rank-and-file government workers. In the Department of Agriculture, for example, a banner temporarily appeared on government computers when employees logged in, telling them that “unauthorized or improper use of this system may result in disciplinary action, as well as civil and criminal penalties.” Agriculture Department spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Labor Department employee told ProPublica that Monday’s memo felt like the latest attack on a workforce already weathering layoffs, spending freezes and reorganizations. “It’s been horrible. It’s been a deeply exhausting roller coaster,” the employee said. “It’s very difficult to work when you’re in a constant state of being terrorized by your employer.”
“We will not cooperate with the destruction of our world,” said the executive director of the Sunrise Movement. As green groups honor the 55th annual Earth Day on Tuesday, environmental leaders are highlighting the need to fight back against the detrimental climate policies of U.S. President Donald Trump and his “billionaire allies,” even as they brace for the possibility of further federal action that could hamper the climate movement. Since entering office, Trump has signed executive orders aimed at bolstering oil, gas , and coal and installed Cabinet members with ties to the fossil fuel industry . Trump’s U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator (EPA) in March announced a sweep of deregulatory actions and his administration has enacted cuts at federal agencies that work on environmental and climate issues , such the EPA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. For Aru Shiney-Ajay, executive director of the youth-led Sunrise Movement , Earth Day is a call to action to resist these moves. “We are ready to fight for our future with everything we’ve got. Our generation will not sit back while Trump and fossil fuel billionaires destroy our home,” said Shiney-Ajay in a statement on Tuesday. “We will not cooperate with the destruction of our world.” “ Donald Trump , backed by fossil fuel billionaires, is waging a full-scale assault on the very lifesaving protections that Earth Day was created to demand,” she added. In addition to actions already taken, Trump is reportedly considering targeting the nonprofit tax-exempt status of green groups, which allows them to forego paying federal income tax. Such a move would likely impact their ability to fundraise because these groups collect tax-exempt donations. It is rumored that such an order could come down on Tuesday, to coincide with Earth Day. Ashley Nunes, public lands policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity , wrote in an op-ed Tuesday that Trump has worked quickly to “pursue an agenda that puts the profits of his billionaire allies above the well-being of the American people and our environment.” Trump’s strategy appears to be to do so much damage that it’s impossible to focus on one issue, wrote Nunes, “yet Earth Day reminds us that our public lands, wildlife and, climate are priorities among the flurry of broad and harmful executive actions.” The executive director at the Center for Biological Diversity confirmed last week that the organization was preparing for a potential presidential order aimed at green groups’ tax-exempt status. Anti-billionaire sentiment is influencing the in-person Earth Day actions planned for Tuesday. On Tuesday, the climate group Planet Over Profit and the protestors who organize under the slogan #TeslaTakedown will picket what they say is the New York home of James Murdoch the son of billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch and a Tesla board member. Tesla is the electric vehicle company of Trump’s billionaire adviser Elon Musk , who has played a core role in Trump’s efforts to slash the size of government. The electric vehicle company is a target because “Tesla ranks fifth among companies producing toxic air pollution in the country” and “there’s no greater threat to our ability to live rich, dignified lives on a safe, stable planet than the Trump/Musk regime,” among other reasons, according to the organizers. According to The Guardian , thousands of people gathered on Saturday in New York City for a march that was endorsed by climate and migrant justice groups. “The two movements converged amid Trump’s crackdown on migrants and embrace of fossil fuels — which will drive further climate collapse and forced migration,” according to the outlet. Climate groups are also coordinating Earth Day mobilization under the slogan “All Out on Earth Day” Meanwhile, EarthDay.org, the global organizer of Earth Day, is featuring Earth Day events around the globe on its website and encouraging people to take part. “We need to demonstrate to our leaders in government and business that we are still here, we are a witness to their actions, and we will hold them accountable to do right by our planet and its people,” wrote Susan Bass, the senior vice president of programs and operations at EarthDay.org, in an opinion piece published Monday.
Around 50,000 career civil servants would be reclassified as “at-will” employees and lose civil service protections. The largest federal labor union in the U.S. said Friday that tens of thousands of federal workers could soon “have their jobs politicized” and be swiftly fired under a new rule proposed by the Office of Personnel Management. Under the rule, an estimated 50,000 career civil servants would be reclassified as “at-will” employees, removing civil service protections and making it easier for the federal government to dismiss them. President Donald Trump and his billionaire ally, tech mogul Elon Musk , have long claimed the federal workforce is rife with “rogue bureaucrats” and is part of the “deep state,” pledging to dismantle the civil service. Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social, that reclassifying workers “will allow the federal government to finally be ‘run like a business.'” “If these government workers refuse to advance the policy interests of the president, or are engaging in corrupt behavior, they should no longer have a job,” he said. Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), said Friday’s announcement was the latest “in a series of deliberate moves by this administration to corrupt the federal government and replace qualified public servants with political cronies.” “President Trump’s action to politicize the work of tens of thousands of career federal employees will erode the government’s merit-based hiring system and undermine the professional civil service that Americans rely on,” said Kelley. “Politicizing the career civil service is a threat to our democracy and to the integrity of all the programs and services Americans rely on.” The new category for civil servants was originally called Schedule F, but the White House said it was changing the classification to “Schedule Policy/Career.” U.S. Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner and Rep. Gerry Connolly, all Democrats from Virginia whose constituents include many federal employees, said Saturday that Trump’s proposal to “hire and fire these workers based on their politics, not their qualifications… makes us all less safe.” The lawmakers have all backed legislation to protect the federal civil service from being reclassified outside of merit system principles without the approval of Congress, and issued a warning to congressional Republicans who have heard from angry constituents in recent weeks about the administration’s spending cuts through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency . “Anyone who cares about our national security, or receives Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or any other critical service administered by the federal government, has a vested interest in protecting our merit-based federal workforce,” said the lawmakers. “We have long fought for legislation to protect the federal workforce from this kind of attack. To our colleagues who will hear from their constituents if government services continue to decline because of this decision: You were warned.”
The impressive turnout reflects the public’s readiness to resist the Trump administration’s far right policy agenda. Across the United States — from Nampa, Idaho to Salt Lake City, Utah to Los Angeles, California — nearly 255,000 people have turned out in recent weeks for “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies headlined by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , a progressive duo that has railed against President Donald Trump and the corporate-dominated systems that spawned him while outlining a vision of a more just future. Over the past six weeks, according to Sanders’ (I-Vt.) office, 254,931 have attended 17 rallies across 11 states and millions have viewed livestreams of the events online. The most recent swing — which included seven stops across four states in less than a week — drew 146,950 people, including in competitive districts with Republican representatives . “This week, the American people turned out in enormous numbers,” Sanders said in a statement late Wednesday. “And their message was clear. They do not want oligarchy. They do not want authoritarianism. They are tired of massive income and wealth inequality and the greed of the billionaire class. They are tired of a corrupt political system that allows billionaires to buy elections. And, most importantly, they are prepared to fight back.” The massive, enthusiastic rallies signal mounting nationwide anger over the Trump administration’s large-scale firings of federal workers, assault on fundamental rights, climate destruction, lawless detention and deportation of immigrants, and push to gut Medicaid and other key programs. “This is not Trump’s country. This is our country,” Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday. “The working class is coming together to defend democracy, fight for one another, and build a better future for all of us.” AOC: On the way here, we got a very interesting piece of news: some of the Republicans whose districts we visited just warned their leadership that they’re not sure they can vote for Medicaid cuts now. That’s you, Montana. That’s you, Colorado. That’s you, Arizona. That’s you,… pic.twitter.com/qnkza5zGJU The events also indicate a desire among Democratic voters for their leaders to respond more forcefully to the president and his billionaire cronies, including world’s richest man Elon Musk . One recent survey found that 70% of Democratic voters give their party a C grade or below for their response to Trump thus far. “We need to fight the oligarchy, like the message says. And that’s real, even in a state like Montana, where we’re very red,” one rallygoer told the Montana Free Press at a Missoula event on Wednesday. In the 2024 election, Trump won Montana by just under 20 points and a Republican ousted three-term Democratic incumbent Jon Tester in the Senate. Another sign of the U.S. public’s readiness to organize and fight back against the Trump administration’s abuses and far-right policy agenda was mass participation in a Wednesday call hosted by the Hands Off! coalition, which helped bring millions into the streets nationwide earlier this month. According to organizers, tens of thousands of people joined the call, which comes ahead of another national day of action planned for May . “What we have begun to build is powerful,” Rahna Epting, executive director of MoveOn, said Wednesday. “As Trump continues to chaotically and carelessly implement his wildly unpopular agenda, he creates more distrust, more outrage, and more backlash against it.” During a stop in Salt Lake City on Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez told a crowd of 20,000 that “we can make a new world, a better country where we can fight for the dignity of all people.” “It looks like living wages, Utah,” said the New York Democrat. “It looks like stable housing, Utah. It looks like guaranteed healthcare, Salt Lake City. And it looks like respect for all of our differences, no matter who we are or where we come from.”
The worker said he received a note with photos of him that seemed to be taken by drone after he spoke out against DOGE. A labor board worker received a threatening note after he became a whistleblower on the all-out raid of the agency by Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” during which Musk’s minions apparently stole a huge amount of sensitive information about workers and union organizers, a new bombshell NPR report finds . The whistleblower, Daniel Berulis, works in the IT department for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). He has raised alarm internally and externally, including to Congress, about DOGE’s infiltration into and extraction of huge amounts of sensitive information from the NLRB’s systems. As soon as DOGE agents descended upon the agency in early March, Berulis and fellow NLRB employees noted concerning practices, with DOGE employees immediately demanding the highest level of access to the agency’s computer systems — which are normally highly safeguarded. In a whistleblower disclosure filed with Congress and corroborated by internal documents, NPR reports, Berulis said that the DOGE employees first set up a process to hide their activities on the servers, rather than allowing account activity to be tracked. This alone is a “red flag,” cybersecurity experts said, and a technique mimicking what a malicious hacker may use when trying to infiltrate government systems. Berulis noticed soon after the raid began that a DOGE engineer was working on a “backdoor” to the NLRB’s case management system, which would allow the rogue group to extract information surreptitiously. Then, he saw within the system’s metrics that there was a massive spike in data being extracted from the network and sent to an unknown location that could contain a huge amount of case information. The IT worker first spoke out internally against the DOGE raid — but when he did, his attorney has said, someone taped a threatening note to his door that contained sensitive personal information about him, as well as pictures of him walking his dog that looked like they were taken by a drone. Whistleblowers have long faced threats to their personal safety, while recent high-profile cases of corporate whistleblowers have created a culture of fear around the practice. Meanwhile, the information exfiltrated by DOGE includes a huge amount of sensitive information about American workers, including “ongoing contested labor cases, lists of union activists, internal case notes, personal information from Social Security numbers to home addresses, proprietary corporate data and more information that never gets published openly,” NPR wrote. In other words, as labor experts said, DOGE may have gotten its hands on the names, addresses and Social Security numbers of labor organizers across the country — at a time when President Donald Trump and Republicans are preparing to majorly dismantle labor protections and attack workers’ rights , including unionization. It also comes from rogue actors assembled by Musk — whose companies are involved in numerous labor disputes. This includes an alarming lawsuit , filed by SpaceX, challenging the constitutionality of the NLRB itself, which is the primary entity in the U.S. protecting workers from labor abuses. Even if that data isn’t being actively used by Musk and his cronies, labor experts said that the fact that they can access it may have a chilling effect on the labor movement, just after it has seen a major resurgence in recent years. “Just saying that they have access to the data is intimidating,” Kate Bronfenbrenner, the director of labor education research for Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations and co-director of the Worker Empowerment Research Network, told NPR . “People are going to go, ‘I’m not going to testify before the board because, you know, my employer might get access.’” The extreme, malicious techniques used by DOGE to infiltrate the system, meanwhile, could also leave this data vulnerable to being seized by other bad faith actors. At one point just minutes after DOGE accessed the systems, for instance, employees noticed log-in attempts from an IP address located in Russia — attempts that used a newly-created DOGE account with the correct username and password.
The administration has fired key employees and threatened to cancel major contracts, making plane crashes more likely. The administration has fired key employees and threatened to cancel major contracts, making plane crashes more likely. On April 10, two American Airlines jets clipped wings on the taxiway at Reagan Washington National Airport outside Washington, D.C. No one was injured in the minor collision, in which six members of Congress were among the 143 passengers. Just two weeks before, on March 28, a formation of four military jets on their way to a flyover of Arlington National Cemetery came within five seconds of colliding with a commercial Delta flight also taking off from Reagan. The harrowing incident came one day after a fistfight broke out among employees in the Reagan air traffic control tower. The incidents occurred at the same busy airport where 67 people died two months earlier on January 29, when an Army helicopter crashed into a passenger plane in midair. But crashes and near-misses seem to be happening all over: Two days after the deadly helicopter crash, a medical jet crashed in Northeast Philadelphia , killing everyone on board and an additional person on the ground. Then on February 17, a Delta flight from Minneapolis carrying 80 passengers crashed, skidded, caught on fire and turned upside down in Toronto. In two separate incidents on the morning of February 25, an American Airlines flight aborted its descent in Washington to avoid a collision, while a Southwest plane emergency aborted its landing in Chicago to avoid hitting a private jet that had entered the runway without authorization. Just days before the D.C. crash involving the military helicopter — the deadliest air crash since 2001 — President Donald Trump eliminated the membership of the congressionally mandated Aviation Security Committee. And weeks later, Elon Musk’s DOGE fired around 400 employees at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These “probationary” employees, who had been in their current roles for less than a year, were fired in late-night emails from a non-governmental email address. Meanwhile, in response to the deadly January 27 crash, Trump went on a raving rant, incorrectly blaming the disaster on DEI. His claims were echoed by his Transportation Secretary , former Real World and Road Rules reality television contestant Sean Duffy. It is well known that FAA systems are aging and need updating: A U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report last September revealed that 51 of the FAA’s 138 systems are “unsustainable,” citing issues like outdated functionality and a lack of spare parts. In 2023, the FAA awarded a 15-year, $2.4 billion contract to Verizon to upgrade and modernize the agency’s telecommunications and IT network. But Musk appears eager to capitalize on problems at the FAA. In late February, The Washington Post reported that the FAA was close to canceling the Verizon contract and instead awarding the work to Starlink, Musk’s satellite internet company. In mid-March, Duffy criticized Verizon’s speed on the project, stating in a press conference: “I want companies that want to move fast. I can’t wait 10 years.” Musk has also stoked concerns about Verizon, claiming on social media that “the Verizon communication system to air traffic control is breaking down very rapidly. The FAA assessment is single digit months to catastrophic failure, putting air traveler safety at serious risk.” Not only was there no source for the “single digit months to catastrophic failure” claim, but Verizon does not yet operate the system . Meanwhile, DOGE brought in employees from Starlink’s parent company, SpaceX, to work on FAA technology. Some of these employees have been given FAA email addresses, according to the Post . In late February, the FAA announced it was testing Starlink terminals in New Jersey and Alaska, and Musk reportedly approved a shipment of 4,000 Starlink terminals to the FAA. Ted Malaska, a SpaceX engineer and “temporary special government employee” with DOGE, told FAA staff that if they “impeded” efforts to deploy Starlink terminals, they risked “losing their jobs.” Meanwhile, sources at the FAA told Rolling Stone that FAA officials ordered staff to find tens of millions of dollars for Starlink deals, mostly via verbal directives that suggest “someone does not want to leave a paper trail.” In late March, the FAA approved the use of Starlink WiFi on United planes. The Starlink-United agreement was signed last September, and the timeline was accelerated in early January. Also in late March, the FAA began allowing private jet owners to request the omission of their names and other personal information from public display online, making it harder for climate advocates and hobbyist jet trackers to track and publicize the private flights of the ultra-rich. This change came following 2024 legislation allowing for increased privacy. Musk has always hated being tracked: In December 2022, two months after he purchased Twitter, the site suspended the account for ElonJet , a Musk plane tracker run by a college student. “This is a glaring conflict of interest,” Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D–Connecticut) and James E. Clyburn (D—South Carolina) said in a joint statement on March 1, referring to the increased use of Starlink technology at the FAA. “These changes are not about Americans’ safety; instead, these are dangerous actions that put Elon Musk’s personal wealth over the American people’s lives.” Congressman Hank Johnson (D—Georgia) concurred : “This kind of corruption and cronyism is breathtaking, and it’s a threat to the safety of the public.” Musk seems to have a personal vendetta against the FAA, which is responsible for overseeing SpaceX. Last year, the FAA fined SpaceX $633,009 in civil penalties for violations during two spacecraft launches. The agency also launched a “mishap investigation” when a SpaceX rocket exploded in midair in January, shedding debris into the Gulf of Mexico and forcing the FAA to delay nearby air traffic. Musk downplayed the explosion, insisting SpaceX would carry out its next scheduled launch. Sure enough, the next SpaceX launch went forward in March, exploding yet again mid-flight , and once again raining debris and delaying flights in Florida and Pennsylvania. Musk and SpaceX argue that the company needs to move quickly and make mistakes in order to learn — calling explosions “barely a bump in the road.” But the resulting flight delays, damage and pollution have real effects. An April 2023 SpaceX liftoff and subsequent explosion shook homes, broke at least one window, and covered Port Isabel, Texas, with brown grime , which one woman described to The New York Times as “truly terrifying.” Local officials in Texas say Musk misled them about his plans when he initially purchased the land for his SpaceX facility, which has since shed debris and shrapnel into a nearby bird habitat, as well as a state park and beach. According to one scientific study, a SpaceX explosion in November 2023 temporarily ripped a hole in the upper atmosphere . Musk has historically been aggressive toward the FAA. Following his September fines, he threatened to sue for alleged “regulatory overreach” and called for the resignation of then-FAA chief Mike Whitaker. Months later, Whitaker stepped down on the day of Trump’s inauguration, four years before the end of his term. “That now gets to provide government oversight over the things that he is trying to get permission to do is one of the most significant conflicts of interest I’ve seen in my career, and it’s inexplicable to me,” Moriba Jah, an aerospace engineering professor and former member of an FAA advisory committee, told ProPublica following the January explosion. Many have been quick to point out that air travel remains generally safe in the United States, and that the string of crashes and near-misses cannot be directly attributed to Trump and Musk. But aviation experts fear that DOGE’s actions at the FAA will lead to more incidents. Trump wants to roll back more governmental regulations, and issued a January 31 executive order instructing agencies to repeal 10 rules for every new regulation put in place. Airline deregulation has a poor safety record: after the FAA began allowing Boeing to self-certify the safety of its own planes in 2009, two 737 Max airliners crashed in 2018 and 2019. And aviation safety experts fear that federal regulation of airline safety is becoming even more challenging. Over the past two decades, airlines have generally stopped conducting their own fleet maintenance in-house, instead sending the planes overseas to be serviced by third parties. Now, in recent years, private equity firms have moved heavily into this airplane maintenance industry — potentially bringing dangerous cost-cutting tactics and a powerful lobbying arm to fight federal regulation. Meanwhile, the DOGE firings are only stretching an understaffed FAA even thinner. In an explosive meeting between Trump, Musk and cabinet members on March 6, Duffy complained that DOGE members had tried to fire air traffic controllers , The New York Times reported. Musk called the claims, which Duffy insisted were true, a “lie.” Even if no air traffic controllers were let go, hundreds of other crucial employees were fired. DOGE’s FAA firings included employees who work in air traffic control support, as well as people tasked with identifying hazardous obstacles in flight paths, and lawyers responsible for keeping drunk or reckless pilots from flying, according to Rolling Stone . Other terminated employees were working on a classified early warning radar system to detect incoming cruise missiles. In Congressional testimony in early March, aviation leaders warned that the firings have put additional stress on the aviation system . “Haphazardly eliminating positions and encouraging resignations are having a demoralizing effect on the workforce,” testified David Spero, president of the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, a union representing 132 of the terminated FAA workers. (In mid-March, a federal judge in Maryland issued a Temporary Restraining Order, ordering the reinstatement of those 132 FAA workers, along with tens of thousands of other terminated probationary federal employees, while litigation continues. That order still currently stands, although on April 8, the Supreme Court halted another order from a federal judge in California that had similarly reinstated fired federal employees.) Duffy has put out a call to hire more air traffic controllers, a field that has been short staffed for decades . Currently, 10,800 controllers fill what should be 14,600 positions, with many working 6-day, 10-hour workweeks. Union reps say the field is struggling to attract more applicants because of the poor work environment, on top of its rigorous standards and long training process. The FAA’s ATC training academy closed operations during the 35-day shutdown under Trump’s first presidency, contributing to the FAA missing its hiring goals by over 500 trainees. “I think recruitment right now is sort of a difficult thing,” Spero said in his testimony. “I don’t really know anybody out there that’s dying to become a federal employee right now, given all the attacks that are happening on them, and that’s what we’re hearing from our folks.” Following the February near-collision in Chicago, Sen. Chris Murphy (D–Connecticut) posted on social media : “Maybe not the best time to fire hundreds of FAA workers, tell the remaining workers you want to ‘put them in trauma’, and let Musk in to cannibalize the FAA for profit.” “Firing people that do this sort of work is not conducive to preventing accidents,” one source told Rolling Stone . “None of these accidents were anything having to do with the new administration — but that’s coming. When you lay off people that investigate these things and prevent these things, it’s only a matter of time.” U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D—New Jersey) was among the six members of Congress whose New York-bound plane was clipped on April 10. Posting about the incident on social media that afternoon, he wrote: “Just a reminder: Recent cuts to the FAA weaken our skies and public safety.”
One source said DOGE is monitoring EPA communications that may be perceived as hostile to Trump or Musk. Staff with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency fear that billionaire and presidential adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency is spying on them using artificial intelligence, according to reporting from Reuters , The Guardian, and Crooked Media’s newsletter What a Day. According to Reuters reporting published Tuesday, Trump administration officials told some managers at the EPA that DOGE is rolling out AI to monitor for communications that may be perceived as hostile to U.S. President Donald Trump or Musk, citing two unnamed sources with knowledge of the situation. According to those two sources, who relayed comments made by Trump-appointed officials in posts at the EPA, DOGE was using AI to monitor communication apps such as Microsoft Teams. “Be careful what you say, what you type, and what you do,” an EPA manager said, according to one of the sources. “We have been told they are looking for anti-Trump or anti-Musk language,” a third source told Reuters. The outlet, however, could not independently confirm whether AI was being implemented. After the story was published, the EPA told Reuters in a statement that it was “looking at AI to better optimize agency functions and administrative efficiencies.” However, the agency said it was not using AI “as it makes personnel decisions in concert with DOGE.” The EPA also did not directly address whether it was using AI to snoop on employees. In response to Reuters’ reporting, the government accountability group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington wrote on X, “Let’s be clear: the career civil servants who work in the government serve the American people, not Donald Trump.” The federal government is reportedly using AI to surveil federal workers for hostility to Trump and his agenda. Let's be clear: the career civil servants who work in the government serve the American people, not Donald Trump. According to Thursday reporting from The Guardian and Reuters , EPA managers told employees during a Wednesday morning meeting that DOGE is “using AI to scan through agency communications to find any anti-Musk, anti-Doge, or anti-Trump statements,” according to an employee who was quoted anonymously. Since returning to power, Trump has launched an all-out assault on environmental protection , including through cuts to programs and personnel at the EPA. According to The New York Times , the EPA has already undergone a 3% staff reduction so far, but the agency also plans to eliminate its scientific research arm, which would mean dismissing as many as 1,155 scientists, according to reporting from last month. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has also said he would like to cut 65% of the agency’s budget. The Guardian and What a Day also reviewed an email from a manager at the Association of Clean Water Administrators, a group of state and interstate bodies that works with the EPA on water quality and management, which warned workers that meetings with EPA employees might be monitored by AI. “We recently learned that all EPA phones (landline/mobile), all Teams/Zoom virtual meetings, and calendar entries are being transcribed/monitored,” the email states. The recorded information is then fed into an “AI tool” which analyzes and scrutinizes what has been recorded. “I do not know if DOGE is doing the analysis or … the agency itself,” according to the author of the email, per The Guardian and What a Day. The EPA denied that it’s recording meetings, but it did not address the question of an AI tool, according to the outlets. According to The Guardian and What a Day, employees at other agencies also fear they are being surveilled. For example, a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs official warned employees that virtual meetings are being recorded in secret, according to an email reviewed by the two outlets. In February, managers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned some workers to be careful about what they say on calls, per an employee there. “It’s like being in a horror film where you know something out there to kill you but you never know when or how or who it is,” one anonymously quoted employee from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development told The Guardian and What a Day, evoking the climate of fear that is rife among government workers.
Termination notices said that the contracts were being canceled “for the convenience of the US Government.” The Trump administration’s latest sweeping cuts to international food aid will kill millions of people across the world if implemented, the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) has cautioned, in the latest warning of the deadly consequences of the Elon Musk-led USAID cuts. Citing numerous officials and organizations, The Associated Press reported on Monday that the Trump administration has ended funding for WFP emergency food aid programs for 14 countries, including places like Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and Gaza, which are war-torn and impoverished in large part due to wars waged by the U.S. military or U.S. sanctions . The cuts come despite administration officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio pledging that emergency food aid programs would be preserved. The administration has cut dozens of contracts, totalling over $1.3 billion , which funded programs like serving food daily to 1.5 million people in Syria and providing treatment to severely malnourished babies and safe drinking water in Afghanistan. “If implemented, this could amount to a death sentence for millions of people facing extreme hunger and starvation,” WFP said in a statement on social media on Monday. The group says it is in contact with the administration to “seek clarification” on the cuts and urge the contracts to be reinstated. The government’s termination notices said that the contracts were being canceled “for the convenience of the U.S. Government,” AP reports. They are apparently being led by a top agent for Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” Jeremy Lewin , who is leading the rogue group’s sweeping cuts to USAID. WFP Chief Cindy McCain further said that the administration’s actions will fuel unrest and conflict across the world. “Continued cuts to WFP’s emergency operations will deepen hunger, fuel instability, and make the world far less safe,” McCain said . “With conflicts and extreme hunger surging, pulling support doesn’t just cost lives — it undermines global stability. ”Previous reports have already found that the administration’s dismantling of USAID will threaten lives due to factors like disease. An estimate by the Center for Global Development found last month that cuts to HIV and AIDS prevention, vaccines and disease prevention, and other food aid will cause 3 million people to die just within the first year of the cuts.
The protests represented the largest public rebuke yet of President Donald Trump and henchman Elon Musk. In communities across the United States and also overseas, coordinated “Hands Off” protests are taking place far and wide Saturday in the largest public rebuke yet to President Donald Trump and top henchman Elon Musk’s assault on the workings of the federal government and their program of economic sabotage that is sacrificing the needs of working families to authoritarianism and the greed of right-wing oligarchs. Indivisible, one of the key organizing groups behind the day’s protests, said millions participated in more than 1,300 individual rallies as they demanded “an end to Trump’s authoritarian power grab” and condemning all those aiding and abetting it. “We expected hundreds of thousands. But at virtually every single event, the crowds eclipsed our estimates,” the group said in a statement Saturday evening. “This is the largest day of protest since Trump retook office,” the group added. “And in many small towns and cities, activists are reporting the biggest protests their communities have ever seen as everyday people send a clear, unmistakable message to Trump and Musk: Hands off our healthcare, hands off our civil rights, hands off our schools, our freedoms, and our democracy.” According to the organizers’ call to action: They’re dismantling our country. They’re looting our government. And they think we’ll just watch. On Saturday, April 5th, we rise up with one demand: Hands Off! This is a nationwide mobilization to stop the most brazen power grab in modern history. Trump, Musk, and their billionaire cronies are orchestrating an all-out assault on our government, our economy, and our basic rights — enabled by Congress every step of the way. They want to strip America for parts — shuttering Social Security offices, firing essential workers, eliminating consumer protections, and gutting Medicaid — all to bankroll their billionaire tax scam. They’re handing over our tax dollars, our public services, and our democracy to the ultra-rich. If we don’t fight now, there won’t be anything left to save. The more than 1,300 “Hands Off!” demonstrations — organized by a large coalition of unions, progressive advocacy groups, and pro-democracy watchdogs — first kicked off Saturday in Europe, followed by East Coast communities in the U.S., and continued throughout the day at various times, depending on location. See here for a list of scheduled “Hands Off” events . “The United States has a president, not a king,” said the progressive advocacy group People’s Action, one of the group’s involved in the actions, in an email to supporters Saturday morning just as protest events kicked off in hundreds of cities and communities. “Donald Trump has, by every measure, been working to make himself a king. He has become unanswerable to the courts, Congress, and the American people.” In its Saturday evening statement, Indivisible said the actions far exceeded their expectations and should be seen as a turning point in the battle to stop Trump and his minions: The Trump administration has spent its first 75 days in office trying to overwhelm us, to make us feel powerless, so that we will fall in line, accept the ransacking of our government, the raiding of our social safety net, and the dismantling of our democracy. And too often, the response from our leaders and those in positions to resist has been abject cowardice. Compliance. Obeying in advance. But not today. Today we’ve demonstrated a different path forward. We’ve modeled the courage and action that we want to see from our leaders, and showed all those who’ve been standing on the sidelines who share our values that they are not alone. Citing the Republican president’s thirst for “power and greed,” People’s Action earlier explained why organized pressure must be built and sustained against the administration, especially at the conclusion of a week in which the global economy was spun into disarray by Trump’s tariff announcement, his attack on the rule of law continued, and the twice-elected president admitted he was “not joking” about the possibility of seeking a third term, which is barred by the constitution. MASSIVE Anti-Trump uprising in NYC!! #HandsOff pic.twitter.com/Gb91kaPTKr “He is destroying the economy with tariffs in order to pay for the tax cuts he wants to push through to enrich himself and his billionaire buddies,” warned People’s Action. “He has ordered the government to round up innocent people off of the streets and put them in detention centers without due process because they dared to speak out using their First Amendment rights. And he is not close to being done — by his own admission, he is planning to run for a third term, which the Constitution does not allow.” Livestream of Hands Off rally in Washington, D.C.: Below are photo or video dispatches from demonstrations around the world on Saturday.

No more looting, no more stealing, no more billionaires raiding our government while working people struggle to survive.”
Trump is pushing a new artificial intelligence-driven bureaucracy to gut public services and use our data to exploit us. Trump is pushing a new artificial intelligence-driven bureaucracy to gut public services and use our data to exploit us. In recent weeks, hundreds of foreign students in the U.S. have received emails from the Department of State informing them that they must leave the country. This “catch and revoke” program is being used to cancel the visas of students who have participated in forms of pro-Palestinian activism the government doesn’t approve of, which may include merely reading or posting certain kinds of content on social media. Thus, in little over a decade, we have gone from social media being touted as a weapon to topple dictators (recall the “Twitter revolutions” of the Arab Spring in the early 2010s) to a tool of mass surveillance that authoritarian governments can use to silence dissent. This time, however, the attack on free speech and the rule of law is aided by a new type of zealous bureaucrat: artificial intelligence. While artificial general intelligence (AGI) remains a fantasy peddled by the right-wing tech oligarchy, we are now witnessing the creation of what I would call artificial bureaucratic intelligence (ABI). ABI is emerging as an autonomous agent dedicated to the rigid and mindless implementation of administrative procedure. As thousands of government workers are dismissed from their jobs, it appears that the plan is to replace them with some form of ABI, which will act as the interface between government (or what’s left of it) and the public. ABI is a “killer app,” because bureaucracy is the one area where failure, inefficiency and arbitrariness are features, not bugs. In 1979, Sen. Eugene McCarthy said that “an efficient bureaucracy is the greatest threat to liberty,” and ABI is poised to become the most effective bureaucrat ever. That’s because an AI bureaucrat won’t be distracted by a desire to flex its power or line its pockets — its sole purpose will be to follow instructions, no matter how disastrous the results. We are already seeing hints of how this could work. In addition to catch and revoke, ABI implementations have been announced to identify government workers who can be fired and immigrants who can be deported (thanks to Donald Trump’s activation of the Alien Enemies Act ). LGBTQ+ people and women seeking information about abortions have also been identified as targets of high tech surveillance. ABI might be initially used to go after populations unjustly considered to be a threat to national security. But as history has shown us, the definition of who or what constitutes a threat can be easily expanded to include anyone, from unionized public and private sector workers, to teachers, Muslims, BLM activists or people on welfare. ABI will act as judge, jury and executioner, carrying out a fascist agenda against anyone who dares question authority. With the help of Big Tech, ABI could be instituted rather rapidly, since it is clear that the Trump administration is not necessarily interested in accomplishing things through democratic means. The most important thing at the moment seems to be setting a precedent, making ABI seem like a normal impending reality. It is thus not surprising to see how few checks and balances seem to be in place to prevent the emergence of this reality. ABI is the result of decades of public sector defunding and neoliberal deregulation by both Republicans and Democrats. Tech companies have benefitted from this deregulation, but since their stocks have fallen sharply since Trump assumed power, they are now desperate for opportunities to monetize their overvalued AI technologies, and ABI represents just that. Still, for all of this to work, one thing is needed, the one thing ABI cannot function without: our data. And since ABI needs lots of it to work, we must follow the data (not just the money) to understand why we can expect colonialist data policies to continue to be an essential part of this system. In one corner we have the U.S. government, which ostensibly faces legal limitations on what data it can collect and how to use it. In addition to spying on us, the government has figured out it can simply buy our data from data brokers . This includes a wealth of information about practically every aspect of our lives, including health, financial, legal, education, employment and consumer data. It also includes all the information about our social activities and networks that is collected by social media companies. In the other corner we have corporations, which are legally obstructed from accessing sensitive data that we entrust only the government to keep. Sure, corporations can access that data if they are doing contract work for the government, but there are usually lots of safeguards involved. However, a new solution has recently been attempted: Why not let the richest oligarch in the world simply take control of government data, in the name of efficiency? As we have seen in the last few weeks, Elon Musk’s so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” has been engaged in a digital coup that involves the capture of entire government data systems. This unholy alliance between government and corporations points to what ABI is on the verge of becoming: a social credit system created by Big Tech (Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft etc.) and sinister tech (Palantir, Clearview AI etc.), fed with our data, and used by the government to carry out its far right agenda. CEOs, pundits and academics used to signal their virtue by wagging their fingers at China and proclaim that at least we in the West were not trying to build a social credit system, a unified national mechanism for treating people according to the data that is collected from them. It now seems the U.S. is on its way to developing such a system overnight. Is this truly a new development? Data has been an instrument of power and management for a long time. And yet, how computers make decisions about our lives is about to change fundamentally. Before ABI, algorithms were given specific criteria, and humans would then have to evaluate the results. For instance, an algorithm could be designed to determine whether insurance claims should be processed or denied, or to help pick targets in a military weapons system. Bias and abuse could be present in the system, certainly, but at least the logic of the algorithm could be examined. ABI takes things a step further. There is no algorithm, no criteria. ABI can simply be given prompts (“identify pro-Hamas students”) and told how to apply a policy (“generate deportation cases for those students”). Accuracy — which is not AI’s forte — is not the goal. Its absence is in fact part of a strategy of state terrorism, because even the blameless live in fear of being singled out. A technology prone to hallucinations is considered deficient in applications that require small error margins and social context, but it is welcomed in situations meant to create chaos, persecution and unaccountability. Lest this all sound rather dystopian, let’s keep another thing in mind: Automation and decision-making systems are already busy at work, directly intervening in the lives of U.S. residents, particularly the most vulnerable. According to TechTonic Justice , all 92 million low-income people in the U.S. are already experiencing some form of algorithmic or AI control over their lives. This means that, as we speak, these systems already have a say in determining how low-income people access disability and Social Security benefits, unemployment insurance, child welfare, supplemental nutrition and Medicaid services. These technologies already control how low-income people encounter services in education, language support, domestic violence and housing. And AI systems are already making decisions about how low-income people interact with the legal, immigration, tax enforcement and voting systems. In many cases, the automated systems that claim to reduce fraud end up unjustly punishing these vulnerable populations . With ABI, these interactions will be extended to all corners of society, as public sector agencies become increasingly governed by the principles of what sociologist George Ritzer called McDonaldization : efficiency, calculability, predictability and control. Guided by these principles, ABI will create a public service technocracy where most of us will experience not just an erosion of access, but the continuation of a system that uses our data to actively exploit us for profit and social control. As we continue to watch the Trump administration dismantle crucial public institutions, and as we work to not just take back but to remake our democracy, we must keep in mind that ABI systems designed in the name of efficiency, calculability, predictability and control are, and will always be, anti-democratic and inhumane.
This is an average of nearly 190 people dying per day while waiting for an initial determination on benefits. The plans of Elon Musk — the richest man on Earth — to slash Social Security and force mass layoffs will cause tens of thousands more Americans to die while waiting for their disability benefits to be approved, a new report by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) has found. Right-wing cuts to Social Security have already caused an erosion in services over the past decades , and in recent years, the number of people who die during the wait time for benefit determinations has risen drastically, to 30,000 people. But if “shadow president” Musk and President Donald Trump’s plans to cut the Social Security Administration by up to half are fully realized, the wait time could more than double to 412 days — resulting in nearly 67,000 people dying this year alone while waiting for an initial decision on their eligibility for benefits. This is an average of nearly 190 people per day, the analysis finds. “President Trump and Elon Musk have suggested that ‘millions and millions’ of dead people receive Social Security checks. That is an outrageous lie designed to undermine Americans’ faith in Social Security,” said Sanders. “Instead of slashing Social Security’s staff, closing down Social Security field offices, we should be making it easier, not harder, for seniors and people with disabilities to receive the Social Security benefits that they have earned and deserve,” the senator went on. The wait time to be approved for benefits is often extremely burdensome for would-be recipients. Sanders’s office conducted a survey asking people about experiences waiting for benefits, and uncovered mass suffering imposed by the already eroded system. “The stories they shared paint a picture of daily hardship: the stress of affording health care, food, and gas; the anxiety of living paycheck to paycheck; and the feeling of hopelessness that comes from constant financial strain, including from seniors and people with disabilities who rely on Social Security,” the report says. One person, Monique, of Florida, said: “I’m unemployed and trying to get on disability. My life is all pain and stress. I’m down to my last few hundred dollars. I desperately need to see several specialists for my ongoing care, but I’m freaking out that I will no longer be able to pay my costs of living. I take multiple prescriptions and they’re costly.” The Trump administration is already well on its way in its plans for cuts. The Washington Post has reported that Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) has already laid off 7,000 workers within the agency since February, and has plans for far more cuts to the remaining 50,000 staff within Social Security. Musk, seemingly in charge of these decisions, has a net worth of over $360 billion. Unlike working class Americans, he doesn’t pay fully into Social Security with every paycheck — in fact, since the wage cap on Social Security is just $168,000, Musk stopped paying into the program four minutes into 2025 , according to back-of-napkin math. Meanwhile, Musk’s plans elsewhere in the government are driving record layoffs, pushing hundreds of thousands more American workers and their families into uncertainty. A Challenger report published Thursday found that, with over 275,000 layoffs, March was the third worst month in U.S. history for layoffs, only behind April and May of 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was largely driven by Musk’s announcement of DOGE’s plans to eliminate over 216,000 positions within the federal government, with over 280,000 job cuts outlined over the past two months. Over 4,000 jobs outside of the government, meanwhile, have been cut due to grant and other funding cuts — many of which legal experts say are against the law. At the same time, more cuts could be on the way, with growing fears that the U.S. will soon go through a recession due to the sweeping tariffs Trump implemented on Wednesday. The tariff announcement led to the largest one-day drop in the DOW and S&P 500 since the outbreak of COVID.
Even if Trump splits with Musk, the tech bro’s strategy of wrecking institutions and pushing legal limits will live on. Even if Trump splits with Musk, the tech bro’s strategy of wrecking institutions and pushing legal limits will live on. Over the past few weeks, Elon Musk has thrown around wads of money so great they made the stories of corruption in the Tammany Hall era, more than a century ago, seem positively quaint. The men of Tammany Hall bought votes with beer; Musk and the oligarchs shamelessly seek to buy them with straight checks. In a pivotal Wisconsin Supreme Court race, the world’s richest man reactivated the million-dollar lottery that he used to bring voters out in November for the presidential race, offering to pay individuals for their signatures on a petition (which notably could help Republicans gain voter information) and denouncing what he referred to as “activist” judges. As the election neared, and it became clear that the vote would essentially be a referendum on Musk and President Donald Trump’s unpopular gutting of the government, Musk’s hyperbolic language reached a fever pitch. Quite literally, he asserted, the future of Western civilization was hanging on the outcome of the race . “I feel like this is one of those things that may not seem that it’s going to affect the entire destiny of humanity,” Musk said in a rally during the campaign’s late days, “but I think it will.” No judicial election in the United States (and probably none anywhere else in the world) has ever had anywhere near the amount of money injected into it that was added into the Wisconsin race once Musk opened the floodgates. And, in the end, nowhere near as much money in any other judicial race has ever been flushed down the toilet as was flushed by Musk in Wisconsin. It turns out that Musk’s political radar isn’t nearly as good as he thinks it is. Despite the tycoon’s intervention — arguably because of his intervention — Democrats were motivated to come out in huge numbers this past Tuesday. Off-year elections are usually characterized by low turnout; this time around, however, almost two-thirds of registered voters cast ballots. In many parts of the state, turnout was upward of 15 points higher than in the last off-year election, in 2023. The result was a blowout: Notwithstanding all the chatter about the Democratic Party being in a death spiral, Democratic Party-backed candidate Susan Crawford won by roughly 10 points in a race that, in normal years, would likely have been decided by a couple percent, and her win succeeded in preserving a liberal majority on the State Supreme Court. The resounding vote for Crawford represented a huge rejection of the Trump-Musk policy axis — and, more particularly, of Musk’s deeply offensive efforts to muscle democracy aside through the sheer power and scale of his wallet, and to use his made-up “Department of Government Efficiency,” or DOGE, to implement a bureaucratic coup against the functioning of the federal government. Trump, whose relationships with even close allies have always been ruthlessly transactional and mostly one-directional, was quick to react to the Wisconsin debacle, making clear that the unconditional loyalty that he demands of those around him is something he has yet to ever bestow on another. Instead of issuing a full-throttle defense of his enforcer and chief henchman, Trump let it be known, according to Politico , that Musk’s tenure at the center of D.C.’s ruthless circles of power could be coming to an end and that he would soon be returning to the private sector. Of course, once the anonymous leaks sharing the potential shake-up led to all-too-predictable headlines, Trumplanders snarled about the liberal media, pouring their faux outrage on the flames. It was, Trump’s aides noted, simply a truism that Musk, as a special government employee, was only allowed to do 130 days of federal work , and that, regardless of the outcome of the Wisconsin vote, his time as the DOGE enforcer was coming to its natural conclusion. That is, of course, utter nonsense. Trump and Musk have trampled so many rules and regulations, so many constitutional provisions that it’s hard to imagine a mere regulation alone would be enough to show Musk to the exit. Nevertheless, to back up the fiction that all was good in the Musk-Trump world, the two co-rulers of what increasingly looks like a post-constitutional U.S. took to social media immediately after Politico reported that Musk’s DOGE days appear to be numbered, to denounce the story as “fake news” and to assure their base that Musk will remain integral to the government demolition project that has broken so much of the federal system since January 20. Certainly, it remains the case that Trump needs Musk as his financial enforcer — he is, after all, the man with the wherewithal to bankroll Republican Party candidates, and to enact huge social media campaigns against anyone who might be tempted to buck his increasingly autocratic and irrational whims. Trump also needs Musk to deflect rage over unpopular policies away from the president and onto himself. And he needs Musk to smash through legal, regulatory and technological roadblocks that stand in the way of his dystopian vision of dismantling much of the federal government. But while Musk is too vital to Trump’s autocratic project to dispense with entirely, the timeline Politico outlined for his stepping out of the spotlight suggested it wasn’t just a matter of his 130-day limit being reached. Instead, it looks like it has more to do with voters’ comprehensive rejection of both Musk’s brutalizing means and also his ends — polling suggests that 6 in 10 voters really don’t like Musk, and a similar percentage oppose what DOGE is doing. That anti-Musk fury is seen on the ground: People have engaged in organic, decentralized protests at Tesla outlets around the country, leading both Musk and Trump to declare that isolated instances of anti-Tesla vandalism should be considered acts of “ domestic terrorism .” Trump has even mused that anyone who perpetrates such acts in the United States should be sent to the supermax prison in El Salvador , where his administration has disappeared hundreds of Venezuelan people snatched up by immigration police. And around the world, a boycott of Tesla has set in, helping to tank what used to be one of the hottest stocks in the world — and pushing Trump to try to shore up his friend’s company’s market value by putting together an extraordinary, and grotesquely degrading, sales pitch for Teslas from the White House lawn. Yet, when push comes to shove, Trump has shown that all he really cares about is his own bottom line and political survival. And since Musk is increasingly seen as an albatross, it’s hardly a surprise that word has leaked from Trumpland that he may soon be eased off into less controversial pastures. That said, don’t hold your breath in the hope that Musk’s malign influence will suddenly evaporate. Even if Trump had the inclination to entirely dissociate himself from his centibillionaire, chainsaw-wielding hatchet man, it’s far too late for him to easily do so. The two power-hungry and egotistical oligarchs are at this point joined at the hip, their capacity for wanton destruction too fine-tuned for Musk to glide off quietly into the shadows. Sure, Musk’s public federal role may soon be folded up, but his philosophy of testing the legal limits and breaking things at speed seems highly likely to remain a central, guiding methodology in Trump 2.0. Where Caesar came and saw and conquered, Musk comes and sees and breaks. He’s a techno-roughrider, and that remains as true today as it was before Wisconsin voters gave the middle finger to the man who believes his money can buy everything, and everyone, on Earth.
Musk spent millions to meddle in a Wisconsin state Supreme Court election — which his candidate lost by double digits. President Donald Trump is reportedly considering pushing “shadow president” Elon Musk out of his administration after the billionaire spent $25 million to elect a Republican to the Wisconsin state Supreme Court — and lost badly. Sources within the administration have told Politico , later confirmed by ABC , that Trump has informed top advisers that Musk may be stepping out of his “special government employee” role. Though such employees are only supposed to work for the government for less than half of a calendar year, the administration previously hinted that they are considering keeping Musk in his front-and-center role past the May deadline. Indeed, just on Monday, Trump had praised Musk when asked about his potential departure, saying that Musk will need to return to other obligations but keeping the door open, saying, “I’d keep him as long as I could keep him.” Wednesday’s reports find that, behind the scenes, Trump is seemingly wanting to bring an end to Musk’s role, with administration insiders increasingly viewing him as an “unpredictable, unmanageable force who has had issues communicating his plans with Cabinet secretaries and through the White House chain of command,” Politico reported. Other inside sources warned, though, that Musk may stay on and just covertly step into a less public role. As the Politico news broke, Musk was preoccupied with posting slurs and minimizing his loss in Wisconsin on his social media platform. If Musk is indeed pushed out, it will come months after the billionaire made the infamous gesture that was celebrated by neo-Nazis as a Hitler salute — and apparently swept aside as a non-issue by the administration. The news came the day after an election in Wisconsin that Musk had heavily meddled in. The billionaire — and richest man on earth — poured $25 million into the race to support the right-wing candidate, Brad Schimel. This campaign included a stunt to give two Wisconsinites a $1 million check in a supposed contest for people who signed a petition to support conservatives. One of the two recipients shared a video suggesting that Musk had given her the check in exchange for her vote. Despite all of Musk’s antics, however, the Democrats’ pick, Susan Crawford, decisively won the race. With an estimated 99 percent of votes counted, Crawford won with a double-digit margin , winning 55 percent of votes to Schimel’s 45 percent. The loss is humiliating for the Trump administration and likely for Musk, whose involvement seemingly only cost Republicans votes. One progressive commentator, Max Berger, noted on Bluesky that the margins between Crawford and Schimel were far higher than the margin of victory for the Democratic candidate in another major race for state superintendent, with that race being won by a 6-point margin — implying that Musk’s meddling cost his candidate an astounding 4 points in support. The news also comes as Musk’s Tesla, facing a national protest movement , has plummeted in value since Trump’s inauguration, with the company’s sales going down. Tesla’s stock has lost a third of its value since the beginning of this year, losing all of the value it gained after Trump’s election. Meanwhile, reports Wednesday found that Tesla’s sales dropped by 13 percent in the first quarter of this year, the largest drop of deliveries in the company’s history, as backlash grows against Musk and his wanton cuts to the federal government — and thousands of people’s jobs and livelihoods .
Nichols also discusses special election results in Florida and Abbott’s delay in calling a special election in Texas. We go to Madison, Wisconsin, to speak with The Nation ’s John Nichols about Tuesday’s pivotal state Supreme Court election, in which liberal Judge Susan Crawford convincingly defeated conservative candidate Brad Schimel. Crawford’s election is a major victory for Democrats after billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk poured about $25 million into the Wisconsin race, helping to make it the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history. “This is a huge signal from a battleground state that Americans are genuinely upset, genuinely angry, I think, with Trump and with Musk,” says Nichols. Tuesday also saw a pair of special House elections in Florida where Republicans held both seats, helping to maintain the party’s narrow majority in Congress. While Democrats were unlikely to flip the deep-red districts, Nichols notes “there was a huge shift in both of the Florida districts toward the Democratic candidates.” This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: We begin today’s show in Wisconsin, where liberal Judge Susan Crawford defeated the Trump-backed Brad Schimel for a seat on Wisconsin’s state Supreme Court in the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history. Many viewed the race as a referendum on Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and Trump megadonor, who’s been heading the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle key federal agencies. Judge Crawford won 55% of the vote, even though Musk spent over $25 million on the race to help elect Schimel. On Sunday night, Musk gave out $1 million checks to two Wisconsin voters, one of whom happened to be the chair of the Wisconsin Federation of Young Republicans. Judge Crawford made a reference to Musk during her victory speech. JUDGE SUSAN CRAWFORD: As a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world for justice in Wisconsin. And we won! … And Wisconsin’s stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price. Our courts are not for sale. AMY GOODMAN: While Democrats are celebrating the results in Wisconsin, as expected, Republicans won two closely watched House races in conservative districts in Florida, but the races were much closer than in November. Joining us from Madison, Wisconsin, is John Nichols, The Nation ’s national affairs correspondent, his new article headlined “Wisconsin Rejects Musk’s Money, Trump’s Lies and the Right-Wing Assault on the Judiciary.” John, overall, I think it’s being estimated that there was something like $100 million spent on this state judicial race. Can you talk about the significance of the liberal Judge Crawford’s victory by quite a large margin? JOHN NICHOLS: It was quite a large margin, Amy. And let me tell you, I don’t think we can overestimate the significance. Going into this race, when people would ask me about it, I would say, “There’s no middle ground. If Crawford wins, it will be a huge signal that Americans are rejecting, obviously, the money that Elon Musk is using to try and buy elections, but also they’re rejecting the direction of the Trump administration.” On the other hand, if Brad Schimel had won, it would have been taken by Trump and Musk as, you know, a total vindication for what they’re doing. The reason that was so is because Wisconsin is an absolute battleground state. It’s incredibly closely divided. In the last seven elections, five — for president of the United States, five have been decided by under 30,000 votes. So this is a state where things are usually very, very close. But it wasn’t that way on Tuesday. Susan Crawford did win by the better part of 200,000 votes. She did win that 55-45 victory. And what’s perhaps most significant is she won communities in regions of the state that had voted for Trump just five months ago in a very, very high-turnout election. So, as I suggest, I just don’t think you can overestimate the significance. This is a huge signal from a battleground state that Americans are genuinely upset, genuinely angry, I think, with Trump and with Musk. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, John, that wasn’t the only race in Wisconsin. There was also an election for state superintendent of public instruction. What happened there? JOHN NICHOLS: Well, you’re sure — you’re exactly right, Juan. And the race for superintendent of public instruction, which is the state’s top education job and is a very significant job — it’s the post that current Governor Tony Evers held before he became governor — was intensely fought. It was a battle between the incumbent, Jill Underly, who has been an absolute supporter of public education — she’s a former rural educator — versus a woman named Brittany Kinser, who was supported by the Republicans and who was supported by advocates for voucher programs that would take money out of public education. Very clear choice. Kinser had a lot of resources. She was backed by a lot of the same campaigners that were out there for Brad Schimel in the Supreme Court race. And Jill Underly won. It wasn’t quite as big a victory as the Supreme Court race, but it was a roughly a 53-47 victory — a very clear, solid win. So, in both statewide races in the battleground state of Wisconsin, the progressive — the clearly progressive candidates won. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, John, could you comment on the results in the two congressional special elections in Florida? JOHN NICHOLS: Sure. Those are important elections, because, you know, special elections in the first weeks of a new president’s term often give us an indication of, you know, kind of where sentiment is going. Now, these were heavily gerrymandered districts. They were designed to elect Republicans. There was no question of that. And the prospect that a Democrat would actually win one of these seats was, you know, pretty hopeful on the part of any Democrat who thought that would happen. However, there was a huge shift in both of the Florida districts toward the Democratic candidates, both of whom, by the way, were not famous people per se or particularly powerful figures, and they were running against very prominent officials in Florida on the Republican side. And yet what we saw is that counties in rural and more urban Florida, that had actually been pretty supportive of Trump, in some cases shifted toward the Democrats. And overall, it was a result that I think Democrats can point to and do a sophisticated analysis. Essentially, what they need to say is this: “Look, these weren’t districts that we were going to win, but these are districts where you could get a measure of where the sentiment is moving in the United States.” And that’s what I would say. Remember, we have a lot of congressional districts across the U.S. that Republicans hold, but that are much, much more closely divided. It would be an easier run for the Democrat. So, if you see this kind of shift in districts across the country in 2026, there’s simply no question that the Democrats would take the House of Representatives. AMY GOODMAN: So, again, those were two special elections in Florida for the seats of the embattled national security adviser Mike Waltz and for Gaetz, who was named as attorney general, nominated by Trump, but then, ultimately, had to pull out and pull out of Congress around various drug and sex scandals. But I wanted to go back to Wisconsin for one minute and ask not only the significance for the country — I mean, if you take what Elon Musk said, he said it’s for the future of Western civilization, but his candidate was defeated — but what this means, for example, in particular, about abortion rights, as the Democrats keep the majority on the Wisconsin state Supreme Court, John. JOHN NICHOLS: Sure. In Wisconsin, it was a very, very clear choice. Susan Crawford has been a very strong supporter of abortion rights for a long time. In addition to being in the past a lawyer for labor unions, she was a lawyer in cases brought by Planned Parenthood. And so, there was no question of where she stood on the issue, and she put it front and center in her campaign. On the other hand, Brad Schimel is a longtime Republican politician who had been very closely associated with the anti-choice position and, in fact, was backed by ardent advocates of a ban on abortion rights. And so, the choice couldn’t have been clearer. And I think that there are always people who like to tell you that abortion is fading as an issue, that as time passes, you know, perhaps it’s not as resonant. But when I was talking to voters yesterday, I was struck by the very strong turnout of young voters. I was at a polling place on the University of Wisconsin campus shortly before the polls closed, and there were literally young women running in to cast their vote, trying to make it in time, you know, before the closing of the polls. And in talking to these folks, you found a number of them were putting the issue of abortion rights very high on their list. So, I think it continues to be a very resonant issue. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to ask you about all this money that Elon Musk is pouring into these political campaigns. I mean, talk about taking Citizens United , the Supreme Court decision, putting it on steroids. Your sense of the legality of all of this, of offering a million dollars to particular voters? JOHN NICHOLS: Sure. Musk’s spending and the way he did his spending has been incredibly controversial in Wisconsin. The attorney general did bring an action against him. Other legal groups have been raising this issue. It didn’t get litigated before the election, but I don’t think there’s any question that there’s going to be a continuing examination of how Musk spent his money and of real questions of whether there were violations of Wisconsin election law. But there’s something deeper as regards all this, Juan. Even if it was legal, what we need to understand is that we had a situation in Wisconsin where the wealthiest man in the world tried to buy an election. He poured his money in, as roughly $25 million, in addition to all these other gimmicks, all these other stunts. And I think that a lot of political analysts would have told you, “Well, that’s going to win, because money wins in politics.” But that didn’t happen in Wisconsin. So, when we talk about the significance of this, beyond the legalities, there’s a political significance. The message out of Wisconsin is that Musk’s money doesn’t win. And that message matters for Democrats, obviously, going into the 2025 fall elections, as well as the 2026 midterm elections. It also matters for Republicans in Congress, because there’s no question Elon Musk has tried to intimidate them by threatening to use his money to punish any Republican that stands up to Donald Trump’s agenda. Well, now those Republicans have a counternarrative, another piece of information, which says that, yeah, maybe Musk’s money could protect you in a primary, but it might not be enough to protect you in a general election. And so, we’ve got a very significant signal out of Wisconsin about money in politics, in general, and about Elon Musk’s money, in particular. AMY GOODMAN: I mean, it is remarkable that one of Elon Musk’s $1 million recipients went to the chairman of the Wisconsin College Republicans, a person who had worked for Ron Johnson, to get him elected, and in the fall of 2024 worked for Turning Point Action, Charlie Kirk’s group. But I want to turn to Texas for one minute, as we wrap up. In an interview with The New York Times , Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott of slow-walking a special election to replace Congressmember Sylvester Turner in Houston, who died last month. This is really significant. I mean, it looks like Abbott is not going to call a special election, at least at this point, but will keep it open, this seat, which would most likely go to Democrat, representing Houston, of course, until the November 2026 election. We just have 30 seconds. JOHN NICHOLS: Sure. I’ve written about these issues a lot in the past, governors playing with special election dates. It is an absolute assault on democracy. We need to understand that congressional seats, House seats, are filled in elections. They aren’t appointed. And so, when you have a governor of one party saying, “We’re not going to let people elect a successor to a member who has passed away,” that governor is saying that “I’m going to leave you, the people of a major American city, unrepresented for the better part of a year and a half.” It is absolutely unacceptable, and Texans should be raising an outcry about what Governor Abbott appears to be doing. AMY GOODMAN: John Nichols, we thank you for being with us, The Nation ’s national affairs correspondent. We’ll link to your various articles at democracynow.org. Coming up, Trump’s escalating war on universities. Stay with us.
Organizer Daniel Hunter says we’re seeing a greater range of tactics under Trump 2.0 — and that should give us hope. When Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, many of us turned to the words of activist and educator Daniel Hunter for comfort and direction. Hunter’s piece 10 Ways to be Prepared and Grounded Now that Trump Has Won offered practical and strategic advice to disrought people of conscience who were reeling in the wake of Trump’s victory. Hunter’s analysis included the observation that “differentiated resistance pathways” would emerge with time. Hunter specified that four of those pathways would be “Protecting People,” “Defending Civic Institutions,” “Disrupt and Disobey,” and “Build Alternatives.” Many politically engaged people are now trying to find their footing within those pathways, while also weathering Trump’s ongoing attacks. I recently had the opportunity to catch up with Hunter to discuss the moment we’re in, and how we can maintain our focus and commitment in these chaotic times. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Kelly Hayes : You wrote a piece that helped a lot of people ground themselves after Trump’s re-election. Now a couple of months into his administration, a lot of us are trying to navigate a new reality. Universities are under attack along with law firms that have taken legal action in opposition to Trump’s edicts. People with permanent resident status have been snatched up by ICE and face deportation, and hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants have been sent to a prison in El Salvador without any due process. How do you view this moment we’re experiencing right now and how should we be approaching it? Daniel Hunter: Well, you framed the bad part very accurately. It’s very dire. There’s a lot of systems that we’ve relied upon in the past that are under attack. One of my friends who works with undocumented residents said the current challenge is that the rules of ICE are unknown right now, and so we don’t know how to stay safe. The behaviors of how they’ve operated have changed. We used to know their patterns. The other thing that’s also happening is new forms of resistance are up and running. One of the most underreported acts of non-compliance was 1.6 million federal workers who were non-compliant with Elon Musk. When Musk first publicized his demand that federal workers submit a list of five things they did last week via email to OPM , he said that anyone who failed to comply would be fired. OPM didn’t mention the part about potentially being fired in the email it sent to federal employees, but the news media sure echoed it. So the mainstream media told everybody that’s what the email was and that’s what would happen. And workers began organizing on Signal threads and saying, I don’t want to comply with this. And began confirming to each other and boosting each other up. And then that moved to the union. So AFGE and others soon followed suit and said, they’re also not going to comply. And then that fell as the pressure mounted, even some of the directors, including some of the sycophants like Patel and Rubio and others, also began following suit and telling people to not comply with Musk’s demand. And so we’re living in a very interesting time because of everything you just said about dire circumstances, and also, there’s an incredible range of non-compliance. Erica Chenoweth just did a report with some of her colleagues where they noted that in February alone, there were twice as many protests than in 2017. And so even though it hasn’t been as centralized as it was, it’s actually a greater range of tactics, more boycotts, more experiments with targeting different things, more range of activity, more people in the streets, that all of those things are true in this moment. And that, I think, should also be in our analysis and in our feeling, which is both—there’s a lot of dire stuff and there’s also a lot of people trying to figure out how to resist. And that should give us a lot of hope. I don’t know if it has to give us hope actually, but it should give us a lot of analysis that people are up for resisting. What do you think of the Tesla takedown movement that’s underway? I love it. Me too. I really appreciate that it’s targeting Elon Musk, and also pursuing a material outcome. When people see the stock drop, they can see the impact they’re having, and I think that’s so helpful and empowering. I also think it’s a movement that’s pulling us in the right direction, in terms of challenging these oligarchs and billionaires. I think you’re absolutely right. And I think I want to just affirm many of the things you just said. The Tesla Takedown is a great example of decentralized protest. It’s not a single organization directing people about what to do. People are able to figure this out and they’re making some smart, strategic decisions. I think tactically it’s smart. It’s also a good direction for us, in terms of making a direct economic impact. It gives us a good narrative, and a chance to organize locally. It gives us a lot of things, but I think there are going to be challenges ahead. I think at some point the protests will start to reach a kind of threshold, and might reach the limit of their impacts. Either because Musk is able to do enough damage control, or they do some reshaping inside the Tesla structure. But I think there may be other tactics that we then need to expand to target SpaceX and Starlink. And I think those are a little bit more tricky targets, but they’re ones that Musk also cares deeply about. On April 20th, the secretaries of the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security are supposed to deliver a report pursuant to one of Trump’s early executive orders, offering a recommendation about whether or not Trump should invoke the Insurrection Act . Are you worried about this report and what it could mean for the public and for our movements? We’re already seeing, as you mentioned at the top of the intro, some of the repression that’s beginning and some of the outlines of how that’s going to unfold. They’re targeting marginalized communities—people who are on the fringes and edges of our society to see how much they can get away with. And so, with regards to the Insurrection Act, I think it’s really important for us to speak out about these cases of Palestinian rights activists who’ve been targeted for deportation. Those are test cases for criminalizing protesting and criminalizing dissent. So regardless of your particular position on what they’re up to, the criminalizing of people for speech and for protest—these are test cases. So there has to be pushback now. I think the second thing is that activists need to continue assessing what kind of security infrastructure we need to put in place. And I think the way that I’ve been trying to hold this for people in terms of thinking through that question of security and my safety is not only thinking about how do I improve my own security, but also the question of how I support the safety of the entire movement. So there’s an organization in the South that got targeted by the federal government. It’s been under attack, and one of the ways that it really got taken out was that when it got targeted, people inside the organization began to openly talk to the media about the group’s internal dissension. That fed a firestorm. So one of the things that we need to do is to take responsibility for each other in a community sense and take responsibility for the safety of the movement, which means not only just looking out for our own individual self, but also looking out for how our actions are impacting other people’s safety and security. The longevity of the organization. So fidelity to movement and fidelity to each other means that we also look out for each other, which often can just be summarized as you don’t comply. Whatever the 10 commandments by Czechs against the Soviet Invasion were: Don’t know, don’t tell, don’t have, etc. —just practice discretion. So I think those are behaviors that we should be practicing in rigorous ways because whether the Insurrection Act gets used or not, the intention of this current administration is clear, which is: they’re going to go after protesters as much as they can get away with. And on that note, when you and I talked shortly after Trump’s re-election, we were in agreement that symbolic arrests were probably not the best thing to pursue at the onset of the Trump administration. Do you still feel that way? I do. There’s going to be lots of opportunities for people to demonstrate and protest. And I think more and more symbolic protests will be very important to signal to people that there’s a lot of people like you. So there are high percentages of the US population that are concerned and are not well aware of the number of people who are already in motion. So we all have a responsibility to tell that story to other people, to tell stories of non-cooperation, of the protests, of the Global Days of Action, etc. And so outlets like yours, Kelly, are so important because people need that message because the mainstream media has been terrible, absolutely terrible, at some of its worst in terms of talking about examples of non-cooperation and non-compliance and protests that are happening right now. In terms of symbolically getting arrested or some of the civil disobedience actions, the place that we need to get to is material challenges, taking over institutions, taking over structures that are currently being battled for. And so things like Tesla Takedown represent a material gain, causing direct economic damage to Elon Musk. That, strategically, is more important than mere symbolism. That might move a few more people, but we’re going to have a lot of opportunities to potentially get arrested later down the road. I really agree with that. I consider arrests a resource. I can only get arrested so many times before the consequences become increasingly dire. And we have a long road ahead, and may have opportunities to stop material harms from happening by putting ourselves in arrestable situations. I want to be ready for that. I also want to clarify that I am not talking about staying within the lines and not breaking the law, but about evading arrest whenever possible, unless there’s a material impact involved, or the opportunity to prevent something harmful from happening. I just want to affirm that there are some fantastic uses of civil disobedience happening right now, like the Sunrise Movement doing an action at the Department of Education when it became clear the department was in danger of being taken out entirely. A small number of people risked arrest, and that action became the image of resistance around the Department of Education. They gave mainstream media who need a hook an image of a bunch of young people taking a stand. FreeDC did another kind of similar action. And so those are very critical and are very much gifts to the movement in that regard because they assist in telling a story, but this didn’t involve a larger push for people to get arrested in that moment. What kind of action do you encourage people to take right now? What’s your vision for how we move? This is a really important time for some experiments, and so for people to feel free to try some different things, to find tactics that move widely, and especially speaking to the “disrupt and disobey” people here. It’s also a really important moment to have conversations with institutions to prepare them for what could be coming their way. So there’s been a lot of conversation about, for example, the capitulation of Columbia University at multiple levels, but they have signaled that they are willing to capitulate to the Trump administration. Equally, we should pay attention to Georgetown University, which has signaled its refusal to capitulate. And in fact, they were told that the administration wouldn’t hire any of their graduates and they came back strong with a very principled stance, and then escalated their response by saying that they would give tuition reduction to federal workers. So that Georgetown letter is an example of what an institution does when it’s holding fast. And we need more examples of that. We also need to tell that story to institutions, because Georgetown has not gotten more and more repression as a result of it. And Columbia, by being soft, actually has shown its weakness, its underbelly, and therefore gotten more severely targeted. And that is commonplace in authoritarian regimes. So a little bit of what we have to do for those of us who are in the disruption category, is to have conversations with institutions to help teach them the strategy of non-cooperation and the strategy that there will be no place in which you will be safe by complying. That is a myth that you’re making for yourself. Because if anybody remembers watching The Sopranos, when you’re dealing with the mafia, as soon as they know you’re weak, they know they can keep going back to take advantage of you. And so the alternative is to show your strength. And that doesn’t guarantee you won’t get repressed, but repression has already happened at Columbia: $400 million getting lost in their budgets. So part of what we have to do is help people understand and get an analysis of the moment of where we are. We’re very late in the day for people trying to comply to make it through. It’s not going to work out. One more thing that I’m aware of, based on what I can see, is that it looks as though a lot of our adrenaline is beginning to wear off at around this moment. For a lot of activists, there’s a drop happening. Physiologically, what we know about adrenaline and oxytocin is that these things get lodged in your body. And so if you haven’t been—which, I haven’t been as much—this is an important time to keep your body in physical motion: running, jumping, having sex, whatever it is, but getting a lot of that, just things in your system moving. And the second thing: what I’ve noticed or observed is, for groups that have been in constant motion, their triage mechanisms are now beginning to fracture a bit. People’s exhaustion levels are increasing. And so this is an important moment for checking back in about how much you can handle, and the pace that you need to move at. I think we know enough about the rhythm of the administration’s strategy, that you can kind of trust yourself, if you’ve been tracking, to not read the news in the way you may have been before, because you know the outlines of what they’re doing. It may be a moment to downshift the amount of projects you’ve been up to, or also just notice the judgment that you’ve been laying on your colleagues that maybe you can let go of a little bit, because there’s just been so much going on. People have been working in the context of overload. And we will not be able to survive if we burn ourselves out by treating this like a sprint. And so again, psychology is really important in this moment. And what I’ve noticed is there seems to be an energetic shift around this period of time. And so that seems to be important for me as I’m chatting with people, to just remind them this is the moment to find a new gear.
Funds for the program could be diverted to Elon Musk's satellite internet company, Starlink. Originally published by Capital B . A promise made by former President Joe Biden to connect millions of Americans to reliable and affordable high-speed internet service may become another casualty of President Donald Trump’s campaign to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives across the nation. A top outgoing official at the U.S. Department of Commerce warned that funds for the Broadband, Equity, Access and Deployment Program, also known as BEAD, may be diverted to Trump adviser Elon Musk’s satellite internet company, Starlink. The BEAD program provides $42.5 billion to states and territories to build and deploy high-speed internet to underserved areas. Evan Feinman, who until March 16 directed the program at the Commerce Department, wrote in an email last week that the broadband initiative — one of the centerpieces of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act — was in jeopardy. Just days later, on March 18, Federal Communications Commissioner Geoffrey Starks resigned from his position, cutting short his term that was set to expire in 2027. Starks was one of two Democrats and only Black commissioner for the FCC. Feinman argued that Starlink’s connections, which rely on Musk’s satellites, are inferior to using fiber optic cables, which is prioritized in the BEAD program. “Stranding all or part of rural America with worse internet so that we can make the world’s richest man even richer is yet another in a long line of betrayals by Washington,” Feinman wrote in the email. Politico first reported on Feinman’s email . Expanding access to high-speed internet service, particularly in rural communities, is seen as a crucial step in alleviating the digital divide — the gap between those who can easily use, access, and afford technology, and those who cannot. Such disparities amplify the deep racial and economic inequalities in education, jobs, and health care for rural Black households in the South, where the greatest divide exists. The BEAD program is also seen as a key element of promoting equity and leveling the technological playing field for communities of color. However, there has been a lag in broadband deployment because of red tape, administrative delays, and the program’s affordability requirements . Digital equity advocates say that such delays were to be expected because the program’s initial timeline indicated it would take until 2026 to implement . Technology experts like Mignon Clyburn, a former FCC commissioner and the first woman to serve as acting chair, also expressed worry that significantly altering the program could result in some marginalized populations being left behind — including veterans, seniors, and households with low incomes. “My communities have been ignored for too long. I want sustainable, affordable, robust technologies. Those people don’t deserve to be cheapened. They deserve to have the best that our resources have to offer,” Clyburn said in an interview, emphasizing that the federal government needs to ensure “that the people currently on the wrong side of the technology divide do not stay there throughout several more lifetimes.” Newly appointed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called for a “rigorous review” of the BEAD program. He criticized Biden’s regulations for the program and emphasized the need to overhaul it with a “tech neutral approach” so that satellite services like Starlink could have a greater chance to participate in it. In recent years, Republican lawmakers have condemned the program because of its DEI labor requirements and other factors. But some of their Republican colleagues have pushed back against their efforts while advocating for their states to continue the work. In a statement, Lutnick said that he is adamant about “ripping out the Biden Administration’s pointless requirements.” “The Department is exploring ways to cut government red tape that slows down infrastructure construction,” the statement read. “We will work with states and territories to quickly get rid of the delays and the waste.” While Trump administration officials appear to prefer satellite over fiber internet, multiple experts said satellite doesn’t fix the problem because it’s not affordable, nor does it work in all regions. Starlink, which services 4 million people, uses satellites to connect internet service to dishes then to devices. Two years ago, the FCC denied Starlink’s application for $900 million in subsidies for rural broadband because the company did not meet the service requirements, according to The New York Times . For residential service at homes, the price starts at $80 a month, according to its website . To assist those in need, the federal government created the Affordable Connectivity Program , which provided a discount of up to $30 per month ($75 for tribal households) toward internet service and mobile services, and a one-time discount up to $100 toward a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet for eligible low-income households. More than 23 million Americans were enrolled. However, Congress did not reauthorize the program. Since the program ended, 40% of Americans cut spending on food to afford internet service, whereas 36% discontinued telehealth services, a recent survey by the National Lifeline Association found. At least 80% of those who were enrolled live at or below the poverty line. The only other program available is the FCC’s Lifeline Program , but recipients only receive a $9.25 monthly discount, which critics say isn’t enough. If consumers can’t afford internet service, it undermines efforts to promote equity, said Brandon Forester, senior campaign lead at Media Justice. “Having a low-cost option makes it more viable for an internet service provider to build out. That’s also true about having digital equity practitioners. If they have people in the community that are helping people sign up for their services and are helping people use their services, that’s a benefit,” Forester said. “If we’re getting rid of digital equity, that’s another loss. When the lights go on on these networks, is there going to be anybody there to connect to them? Maybe, maybe not.” With the current program, installing fiber creates jobs and workforce development, which could be dismantled, said Alisa Valentin, broadband policy director at Public Knowledge. She also points to the hard work of state broadband offices and federal workers, and doesn’t want it to be in vain. “We want to ensure that broadband is deployed where it is needed the most to avoid wasting time and resources. We want to get this right. This is a historic amount of funds that I’m so proud that we were able to come together across government, across public interest organizations, across industries to make sure that this happens,” she said. “We got to make sure we finish the job.” Beyond BEAD, advocates and experts say there are threats looming for other programs and legislation, including the Digital Equity Act, which provides $2.75 billion to establish three grant programs that “promote digital equity and inclusion.” The Digital Equity Act increases access to digital technology, education, and economic opportunities. The uncertainty is forcing states to cease work, questioning the future of their programming. For example, in Texas, the broadband office paused grants and contracts because of the Trump administration’s shift of federal priorities. There are some states moving forward despite the uncertainties. Clyburn said she doesn’t foresee states rolling back the work they’ve done because they simply want to get to the finish line to connect communities, expand the workforce, build partnerships and “level the playing field,” and they shouldn’t be penalized over political bias. This is the time for advocates to keep fighting and doing the work, said Kristenn Fortson, communications director for the National Digital Inclusion Alliance. The organization brings organizers to Washington to speak directly to lawmakers about their experiences and importance of these programs. “It’s the grandfather who can now join his church virtually or FaceTime his grandchildren after being home bound for months. It’s incarcerated women who are being taught digital skills so they can build a resume and successfully reenter society,” Fortson said. She added: “We know from the history of any movement centered on equity and equality that nobody can really guarantee that for us; we have to fight for it. We keep on pushing for it like anybody else who’s come before us, trying to make their communities a better place to live, a better place to thrive.”
Tens of thousands worldwide held “Tesla Takedown” protests at over 200 locations on Saturday. Outraged by Elon Musk’s devastating contributions to the Trump administration, tens of thousands worldwide held “Tesla Takedown” protests at over 200 locations on Saturday. Protests began the day in front of Tesla showrooms in Australia and New Zealand. They then rippled across Europe, including Finland, Norway, Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands, and the UK. In the US, protests occurred in nearly every state, including the northeast, south, midwest, and west coast. “Elon Musk is destroying our democracy, and he’s using the fortune he built at Tesla to do it,” organizers wrote on Action Network, which has an interactive map of the protest sites. “We are taking action at Tesla to stop Musk’s illegal coup.” Organizers also have a message for people with ties to the company: “Sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.” Since Musk began dismantling the federal bureaucracy as chief of President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), critics have protested at Tesla facilities and posted videos about selling their vehicles on social media. While protesting at the Tesla dealership in west London, Louise Cobbett-Witten told The Guardian : “It’s too overwhelming to do nothing. There is real solace in coming together like this. Everyone has to do something. We haven’t got a big strategy besides just standing on the side of the street, holding signs and screaming.” Alainn Hanson, of Washington, DC, brought her mother from Minnesota to their first Tesla protest. She told CNN : “I’m sick of billionaires trampling over working class people.” Here are some of Saturday’s actions: Saint Petersburg, Florida 🚨 HAPPENING NOW: Protesters gather at a Tesla dealership in St. Petersburg, Florida.

The military contractor allows such investment through secrecy hubs like the Cayman Islands, court records say. This story was originally published by ProPublica . ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. Elon Musk’s aerospace giant SpaceX allows investors from China to buy stakes in the company as long as the funds are routed through the Cayman Islands or other offshore secrecy hubs, according to previously unreported court records. The rare picture of SpaceX’s approach recently emerged in an under-the-radar corporate dispute in Delaware. Both SpaceX’s chief financial officer and Iqbaljit Kahlon, a major investor, were forced to testify in the case. In December, Kahlon testified that SpaceX prefers to avoid investors from China because it is a defense contractor. There is a major exception though, he said: SpaceX finds it “acceptable” for Chinese investors to buy into the company through offshore vehicles. “The primary mechanism is that those investors would come through intermediate entities that they would create or others would create,” Kahlon said. “Typically they would set up BVI structures or Cayman structures or Hong Kong structures and various other ones,” he added, using the acronym for the British Virgin Islands. Offshore vehicles are often used to keep investors anonymous. Experts called SpaceX’s approach unusual, saying they were troubled by the possibility that a defense contractor would take active steps to conceal foreign ownership interests. Kahlon, who has long been close to the company’s leadership, has said he owns billions of dollars of SpaceX stock. His investment firm also acts as a middleman, raising money from investors to buy highly sought SpaceX shares. He has routed money from China through the Caribbean to buy stakes in SpaceX multiple times, according to the court filings. The legal dispute centers on an aborted 2021 deal, when SpaceX executives grew angry after news broke that a Chinese firm was going to buy $50 million of the company’s stock. SpaceX then had the purchase canceled. In separate testimony, the rocket company’s CFO explained that the media coverage was “not helpful for our company as a government contractor.” SpaceX’s business is built on those contracts, with the U.S. government paying the company billions to handle sensitive work like building a classified spy satellite network. Company executives were concerned that coverage of the deal could lead to problems with national security regulators in the U.S., according to Kahlon’s testimony and a filing from his attorneys. SpaceX, which also launches rockets for NASA and sells satellite internet service, is perhaps the most important pillar of Musk’s fortune. His estimated 42% stake in the company is valued at around $150 billion. If he owned nothing else, he’d still be richer than Bill Gates. Federal law gives regulators broad power to oversee foreign investments in tech companies and defense contractors. Companies only have to proactively report Chinese investments in limited circumstances, and there aren’t hard and fast rules for how much is too much. However, the government can initiate investigations and then block or reverse transactions they deem a national security threat. That authority typically does not apply to purely passive investments in which a foreign investor is buying only a small slice of a company. But experts said that federal officials regularly ask companies to add up Chinese investments into an aggregate total. The U.S. government charges that China has a systematic strategy of using even minority investments to secure leverage over companies in sensitive industries, as well as to gain privileged access to information about cutting-edge technology. U.S. regulators view even private investors in China as potential agents of the country’s government, experts said. The new materials do not contain allegations that the Chinese investments in SpaceX would violate the law or were directed by the Chinese government. The company did not respond to detailed questions from ProPublica . Kahlon declined to comment on the reasons for SpaceX’s approach. It’s not uncommon for foreigners to buy U.S. stock through a vehicle in the Cayman Islands, often to save money on taxes. But experts said it was strange for the party on the other side of a deal — the U.S. company — to prefer such an arrangement. ProPublica spoke to 13 national security lawyers, corporate attorneys and experts in Chinese finance about the SpaceX testimony. Twelve said they had never heard of a U.S. company with such a requirement and could not think of a purpose for it besides concealing Chinese ownership in SpaceX. The 13th said they had heard of companies adopting the practice as a way to hide foreign investment. “It is certainly a policy of obfuscation,” Andrew Verstein, a UCLA law professor who has studied defense contractors, said of the SpaceX testimony. “It hints at potentially serious problems. We count on companies to be forthright with the government about whether they’ve taken money from America’s rivals.” The new material adds to the questions surrounding Musk’s extensive ties with China, which have taken a new urgency since the world’s richest man joined the Trump White House. Musk has regularly met with Communist Party officials in China to discuss his business interests in the country, which is where about half of Tesla cars are built. Last week, The New York Times reported that Musk was scheduled to get a briefing on secret plans for potential war between China and the U.S. The Times later reported that the briefing was called off, and Trump denied it had ever been scheduled. The president told reporters it would be wrong to show the war plans to the businessman: “Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible perhaps to that,” Trump said. The Delaware court records reveal SpaceX insiders’ intense preoccupation with secrecy when it comes to China and detail a network of independent middlemen peddling SpaceX shares to eager Chinese investors. (Unlike a public company, SpaceX exercises significant control over who can buy into the company, with the ability to block sales even between outside parties.) But the case leaves unanswered the question of exactly what percentage of SpaceX is owned by Chinese investors. The Financial Times recently reported that Chinese investors had managed to acquire small amounts of SpaceX stock and that they were turning to offshore vehicles to do so. The deals were structured to limit the information investors receive, the outlet said. The Delaware records reveal additional, previously unreported Chinese investments in SpaceX but do not say how much they were worth. The few Chinese investments in SpaceX where a dollar figure is publicly known total well under $100 million. The experts said the court testimony is puzzling enough that it raises the possibility that SpaceX has more substantial ties to China than are publicly known and is working to mask them from U.S. regulators. A more innocent explanation, they said, is that SpaceX is seeking to avoid scrutiny of perfectly legal investments by the media or Congress. Once a welcome source of cash, Chinese investment in Silicon Valley has become the subject of intense debate in Washington as hostility between the two countries deepened in recent years. Corporate lawyers told ProPublica they’d counsel their clients against requiring the use of offshore vehicles because it could make it look like they are trying to hide something from the government. Bret Johnsen, the SpaceX CFO, testified in the Delaware dispute that the company does not have a formal policy about accepting investments from countries deemed adversaries by the U.S. government. Rather, he said, SpaceX has “preferences that kind of feel like a policy.” Sensitive to how such financial ties could make it “more challenging to win government contracts,” Johnsen said that he asks fund managers to “stay away from Russian, Chinese, Iranian, North Korean ownership interest.” In the public portion of his deposition, Johnsen wasn’t asked whether routing Chinese money offshore made such investments acceptable to SpaceX. But he lent credibility to Kahlon, the investor who said that was enough to get the green light. Johnsen said that he has a long-standing personal relationship with Kahlon and that he’s discussed the company’s approach to Chinese ownership with him. The CFO added that he trusts Kahlon to bring in only investors that the company approves of. Over the years, Kahlon has personally helped Chinese investors buy stakes in SpaceX on “a number of occasions” through “proxies such as British Virgin Islands- or Cayman Islands-based entities,” according to a filing from his lawyers. He also knows of “many” other Chinese investors who own SpaceX shares, the filing said. He learned about them through conversations with investors and brokers, as well “from having viewed investor lists.” Kahlon is a consummate SpaceX insider. He “has been with the company in one form or fashion longer than I have,” said Johnsen, who’s worked at SpaceX for 14 years. Early in his career, Kahlon worked for Peter Thiel at the same venture capital firm that once employed JD Vance, and he first met with SpaceX around 2007 a few years after it was founded. Kahlon eventually opened his own firm called Tomales Bay Capital, becoming a major player among the middlemen who cater to would-be investors in SpaceX. He’s helped people like former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos buy pieces of the rocket company. He also said he has served as a “back channel” between SpaceX and international regulators as the company sought to bring its satellite internet products to countries like India. Kahlon and Johnsen were forced to testify after the deal with a Chinese firm fell apart in late 2021, sparking years of litigation. That year, Kahlon had the opportunity to buy more than half a billion dollars of SpaceX stock from a West Palm Beach private equity firm. Kahlon had already brought Chinese money into SpaceX before, he testified, and he again turned to China as he gathered funds to purchase the stake. Kahlon soon connected with a Shanghai-based company called Leo Group, short for “Love Each Other.” As Kahlon made his pitch during their first call, Leo was told that “it would be best not to disclose the name of SpaceX,” an executive at the Chinese company later testified. “They deemed that information to be quite sensitive.” Leo quickly sent Kahlon $50 million. He then messaged another business associate in China: “Have any folks interested in spcex still?” Kahlon testified that he was planning to tell Johnsen about the Leo investment and expected the CFO to sign off on it. But the deal blew up after Leo mentioned SpaceX in a regulatory filing that generated widespread coverage in the Chinese business press. (Whether Leo had Kahlon’s permission to make the disclosure is a matter of dispute.) In a panic, Kahlon enlisted a Leo vice president to try to get the articles taken down. But when Johnsen and Tim Hughes, SpaceX’s top in-house lobbyist, spotted the stories, they grew alarmed. “This is not helpful for our company as a government contractor,” the SpaceX CFO later testified regarding the press attention. “It, in essence, arms our competitors with something to use as a narrative against us.” “In my entire professional career, this was literally the worst situation that I’ve been in,” Kahlon said. “I failed at what I thought was a core responsibility in the relationship we had.” SpaceX ultimately decided to let Kahlon buy only a smaller portion of the stake, purchasing much of the half-billion dollar investment itself. According to contemporaneous messages and testimony from Kahlon, he was told that decision was made by Musk. However, Kahlon continued to have a strong relationship with SpaceX after the mishap, court records say, with the company allowing his firm to keep buying a large quantity of shares. Musk’s business interests in China extend far beyond SpaceX’s ownership structure — a fact that has drawn criticism from Republican lawmakers over the years. In 2022, after Tesla opened a showroom in the Chinese region where the government runs Uyghur internment camps, then-Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted, “Nationless corporations are helping the Chinese Communist Party cover up genocide.” In addition to Tesla’s sprawling factory in Shanghai, last year, almost 40% of Tesla’s sales were to Chinese customers. The company has also secured major tax breaks and regulatory victories in the country. In 2019, the Chinese premier offered Musk the country’s equivalent of a green card. In recent years, the billionaire has offered sympathetic remarks about China’s desire to reclaim Taiwan and lavished praise on the government. “My experience with the government of China is that they actually are very responsive to the people,” Musk said toward the end of Trump’s first term. “In fact, possibly more responsive to the happiness of people than in the U.S.” Do you have any information we should know about Elon Musk’s businesses?

We follow the money to reveal the out-of-state billionaires who have spent big to try to influence state supreme courts. Wisconsin’s state supreme court election on April 1 is officially the most expensive in U.S. history, with spending that has reached $76 million — with some predictions that the ultimate tally will top $100 million, almost twice the record spending in the state’s 2023 race. The biggest right-wing groups running an attack ad blitz against liberal candidate Susan Crawford are funded by a few very regressive out-of-state billionaires using their cash like a giant megaphone. Elon Musk and Dick Uihlein are the biggest known backers of Republican Brad Schimel’s efforts to win the swing vote seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The uber-controversial Musk has spent over $19 million so far, backing Schimel. Uihlein is bankrolling multiple groups , including some, like the “Women Speak Out” PAC, that are joining an echo chamber of state anti-abortion groups that are all-in on Schimel. Joining the chorus for Schimel are the MAGA get-out-the vote operation Turning Point Action , fossil fuel billionaire Charles Koch’s Americans for Prosperity , the Republican State Leadership Committee (which is heavily funded by groups tied to Federalist Society co-chair and right-wing money man Leonard Leo), the far-right House Freedom Action (tied to the House Freedom Caucus), and the state trade group called Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce . The stakes are high: the outcome will decide the fate of abortion access, fair maps, labor rights and more in that swing state. Big money knows that the composition of the court, which for now has a 4-3 progressive majority, hangs in the balance. This Wisconsin race stands out for the sheer amount of money being spent, but far-right billionaires and the networks they fund have been spending big across the country in recent elections to install their preferred candidates on state courts — a key lever of power and, in some states, a last bastion of protections for democracy. State courts are a key line of defense protecting what a majority of Americans want: better-funded public schools , worker protections , access to abortion care and more. Leo and Koch , in particular, worked for years to capture the U.S. Supreme Court and lower courts to impose unpopular policies by undemocratic means. Some lesser-known GOP billionaires — such as Dick Uihlein and Jeffrey Yass –– have also entered the state court capture effort in recent years. The importance of state courts has only grown in recent years. America entered a new era for spending in state court races in 2022 following the U.S. Supreme Court’s partisan 6-3 ruling in Dobbs , which overturned the Roe v. Wade precedent that protected the federal constitutional right to abortion. That edict sent the issue of abortion access to the states. In response, big money tied to right-wing megadonors and political operatives has increasingly targeted state courts to try to block access to abortion. Judicial election spending nearly doubled any previous midterm cycle’s spending in the 2022 cycle after the Dobbs ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court also largely limited the role of federal courts in disputes over redistricting , the process for drawing boundaries in election maps, which can be hijacked and drawn in partisan ways to lock in legislative control. Two key national groups with ties to Leo, the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) and the Uihlein-backed Fair Courts America, have been pushing tens of millions of dollars into state court elections across the U.S. in order to place judges on state benches to advance their agendas. RSLC, whose largest donor in recent years is Leo’s Concord Fund (also known as JCN or Judicial Crisis Network), deploys attack ads via its Judicial Fairness Initiative (RSLC-JFI). The Concord Fund alone gave nearly $3 million to RSLC last year, which spent nearly $4 million right before the 2024 elections. RSLC-JFI launched a $2 million ad campaign in Wisconsin in February. Anti-abortion billionaire Dick Uihlein is also deeply involved in efforts to capture state courts via his Super PAC, Fair Courts America (FCA), which spends directly on judicial elections and funds other right-wing state-level groups that are involved in judicial elections. It is led by Andrew Wynne, who has also led RSLC-JFI. FCA is heavily funded by Uihlein and his Restoration PAC, with some additional funding from billionaires such as Timothy Mellon (a major Trump donor ) and poultry magnate Ron Cameron . Notably, the Foundation for Fair Courts , which is also tied to Uihlein’s Restoration PAC, received $2.5 million from Leo’s Concord Fund between 2021-2023. FCA spent $5.5 million in Wisconsin in 2023 and has already spent nearly $ 4 million backing Brad Schimel so far in 2025. Past is prologue. Here is an overview of billionaires and right-wing special interests who spent big trying to capture state courts in 2024: In Arizona, big spending helped retain right-wing supreme court justices Clint Bolick and Kathryn Hackett King. These elections took on renewed urgency for reproductive rights activists after the state’s highest court allowed an 1864 abortion ban to stand in the lead-up to the 2024 election. Bolick has deep ties to the right-wing infrastructure in Arizona: he was the longtime vice president of litigation for the Goldwater Institute , a key right-wing legal advocacy group in Arizona. There, he led efforts to create the “Goldwater Litigation Alliance,” which would later become American Juris Link (AJL), a right-wing litigation center that has extensive funding from the Bradley Foundation and groups linked to Charles Koch and Leonard Leo . Billionaire Randy Kendrick, a board member of the Goldwater Institute, also weighed in. She helped launch a new group called the “Judicial Independence Defense PAC,” which backed the incumbent right-wing justices on the Arizona Supreme Court. Dick Uihlein’s FCA also spent over $500,000 on ads in the final two weeks of that retention election. Both judges won their retention elections. In Michigan, Democratic justices Kyra Harris Bolden and Kimberly Thomas defeated their opponents in a landslide, expanding the Democratic majority on the court to 5-2. The Republican judicial candidates, Patrick O’Grady and Andrew Fink, were backed by groups like Right to Life of Michigan and Citizens for Traditional Values PAC . RSLC-JFI spent more than $500,000 on ads backing the Michigan Republicans in October, and the billionaire DeVos family also contributed to their election campaigns. A super PAC funded by Michael Bloomberg called “Justice for All” backed the incumbent j ustices Bolden and Thomas — as did a group called “Justice Project Action,” among others. In Montana, the state supreme court has been one of the last-standing bulwarks against what has otherwise been a far-right takeover of the state’s government. The court, which is nonpartisan, has faced the ire of a hyper-partisan GOP governor, attorney general, and state legislature. The legislature created a committee in 2024 to “rein in” Montana courts, and it pre-filed 27 bills for 2025, including bills that would shrink the state supreme court and add partisan labels to judicial elections. The result in 2024 was mixed: Cory Swanson — who was backed by RSLC, the business lobby, and other right-wing interests — was elected as chief justice. RSLC launched a last-minute $300,000 ad campaign on his behalf in the final weeks of the election, and later bragged that his election “ensures conservatives have an advantage on the state supreme court in Helena.” Katherine Bidegaray, who was backed by the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, defeated Republican-backed Dan Wilson for the other open seat . Uihlein’s FCA also weighed in and gave $200,000 to a group called the “Montana Judicial Accountability Initiative,” which is tied to Republican operative Jake Eaton, whose groups backed Swanson and Wilson. In North Carolina, Democrat Allison Riggs defeated Republican Jefferson Griffin, although he has refused to concede the race. Griffin’s strategy to overturn the election on the North Carolina Supreme Court now hinges on asking his colleagues on the very appeals court he sits on to decide the election and discard more than 60,000 of North Carolinians’ lawfully cast votes. Notably, Charles Koch’s Americans for Prosperity spent over $100,000 on mailers backing Griffin, who also benefitted from ads by the state business chamber and other local industry interests and other groups with funding from “Citizens for a Better NC, ” which itself is funded by RSLC and other national GOP interests. Right-wing interests won big in Ohio, where Republicans swept all three seats on the state supreme court. This came after the Republican legislature mandated that political parties be listed alongside the names of judicial candidates in 2021. The race drew widespread attention because of how the outcome could affect abortion access in the state, where voters approved an amendment to enshrine reproductive rights in the state’s constitution in 2023, a measure Republicans continue to fight despite the will of the voters. Ahead of the 2024 election, the Republican majority on the Ohio Supreme Court drew outrage after it approved severely misleading ballot language for a measure that was intended to ban partisan gerrymandering , Issue One. The measure failed to get enough votes to pass. To fight Issue One, a new PAC emerged in Ohio, called Frecka PAC. Its sole funder was plastics manufacturer David Frecka, who pumped $2 million into the group, which in turn spent at least $1.2 million in the state court races and opposing Issue One. Frecka has become a major donor to right-wing candidates and causes, including to the Trump-aligned Conservative Partnership Institute (CPI), which recognized Frecka as a few of a handful of “heroes” of 2021. CPI has been described as the “nerve center for the rightwing,” that “has become a breeding ground for the next generation of Trump loyalists and an incubator for policies he might pursue.” Business interests have also long spent heavily in the state to elect judges friendly to corporate interests. A group affiliated with the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, called Ohioans for a Healthy Economy Action (OHE Action), reported spending over $2.3 million in the race. OHE Action received $1 million from Uihlein’s FCA. Other large backers included the Haslam family fortune (which owns the Cleveland Browns ) and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy . RSLC-JFI also reportedly spent around $1 million in the race with misleading ads painting the Democratic candidates as soft on crime, a dog whistle refrain in the group’s attack ads across the country. Texas also saw an avalanche of outside spending in judicial races that Republicans largely swept in the November 2024 elections. Three Republican justices on the state’s nine-member court were up for re-election and won by margins of between 56 to 58 percent of the vote. Elon Musk contributed heavily to groups spending on Texas judicial races, leading a wave of spending that helped flip 23 state court seats to Republicans in 2024. A group called the Judicial Fairness PAC , for example, received $2 million from Musk, $1 million from Leo’s Concord Fund and millions more from oil and gas interests. The group eventually spent over $15 million , including funding a group attacking Harris County Democrats called “Stop Houston Murders.” Another group, Texans for Lawsuit Reform — funded by Musk, Miriam Adelson, Harlan Crow and others — spent a total of $1.2 million on Texas’s 2024 judicial races. The Leo group-fueled RSLC-JFI itself also spent nearly $2 million backing 10 Republican judicial candidates. Pennsylvania also has three Democratic seats up for retention in November. This will likely mean big spending by Pennsylvania billionaire Jeffrey Yass and his “Commonwealth Leaders Fund” to try to capture that supreme court, as they have done in past cycles. Scott Presler’s “Early Vote Action” group, which received $1 million from Musk in 2024, has already been gearing up for those retention elections, launching three websites targeting each justice up for retention. Last year, Pressler’s super PAC heavily targeted a few swing states, and focused most deeply on Pennsylvania. If the justices are not retained, the governor would appoint their replacements to serve until 2027, then open elections would be held for the seats, opening up a possibility for Republicans to flip the court to a 5-2 Republican majority ahead of the 2028 elections. “We’ll make Pennsylvania the next Ohio,” Presler said . As the Republican-appointees on the U.S. Supreme Court continue to roll back federal protections, the battle over who sits on these state benches is taking on renewed urgency. State courts handle many more cases than federal courts. State court rulings will have far-reaching consequences for our environment, and the rights, health and freedom of millions of people every year. What’s at stake are our very freedoms — to choose who we can love, to have access to healthcare and contraception, to breathe clean air, to have fair representation and much more. State courts are the battleground where many of our rights as Americans will be won or lost.

More than $80 million has been spent, outpacing the previous high of $56 million. It’s expected to reach $100 million. This story was originally published by ProPublica . ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. Ten years ago, when Wisconsin lawmakers approved a bill to allow unlimited spending in state elections, only one Republican voted no. “I just thought big money was an evil, a curse on our politics,” former state Sen. Robert Cowles said recently of his 2015 decision to buck his party. As Wisconsin voters head to the polls next week to choose a new state Supreme Court justice, Cowles stands by his assessment. Voters have been hit with a barrage of attack ads from special interest groups, and record-setting sums of money have been spent to sway residents. What’s more, Cowles said, there’s been little discussion of major issues. The candidates debated only once. “I definitely think that that piece of legislation made things worse,” Cowles said in an interview. “Our public discourse is basically who can inflame things in the most clever way with some terrible TV ad that’s probably not even true.” More than $80 million has been funneled into the race as of March 25, according to two groups that have been tracking spending in the contest — the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy group that follows judicial races, and the news outlet WisPolitics. That surpasses the previous costliest judicial race in the country’s history, approximately $56 million spent two years ago on the Supreme Court race in Wisconsin. Money is pouring into this swing state election so fast and so many ads have been reserved that political observers now believe the current race is likely to reach $100 million by Tuesday, which is election day. “People are thoroughly disgusted, I think, across the political spectrum with just the sheer amount of money being spent on a spring Supreme Court election in Wisconsin,” said Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin, which has long advocated for campaign finance reform. But the elected officials who could revamp the campaign finance system on both sides of the aisle or create pressure for change have been largely silent. No bills introduced this session. No press conferences from legislators. The Senate no longer even has a designated elections committee. The current election pits former Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel, now a circuit court judge in conservative-leaning Waukesha County, against Susan Crawford, a judge in Dane County, the state’s liberal bastion. Though the race technically is nonpartisan, the Democratic Party, including former President Barack Obama, has endorsed Crawford; the party has received financial support from liberal billionaire George Soros. On the other side, President Donald Trump posted a message on his social media platform on March 21 urging his supporters to vote for Schimel, and much of Schimel’s money comes from political organizations tied to Elon Musk. The stakes are high. Whoever wins will determine the ideological bent of the seven-member court just two years after Janet Protasiewicz won a seat on the court and swung it to the liberals. With Protasiewicz on the court, the majority struck down state legislative maps, which had been drawn to favor Republicans, and reinstated the use of drop boxes to collect absentee ballots. A Schimel victory could resurrect those and other voting issues, as well as determine whether women in the state will continue to be able to access abortion. Two pro-Schimel groups linked to Musk — America PAC and Building America’s Future — had disclosed spending about $17 million, as of March 25. Musk himself donated $3 million this year to the Republican Party of Wisconsin. In the final stretch of the campaign, news reports revealed that Musk’s America PAC plans to give Wisconsin voters $100 to sign petitions rejecting the actions of “activist judges.” That has raised concerns among some election watchdog groups, which have been exploring whether the offer from Musk amounts to an illegal inducement to get people to vote. On Wednesday night, Musk went further, announcing on X a $1 million award to a Green Bay voter he identified only as “Scott A” for “supporting our petition against activist judges in Wisconsin!” Musk promised to hand out other million-dollar prizes before the election. Musk has a personal interest in the direction of the Wisconsin courts. His electric car company, Tesla Inc., is suing the state over a law requiring manufacturers to sell automobiles through independent dealerships. Musk and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment about his involvement in the race. Also on Schimel’s side: billionaires Diane Hendricks and Richard Uihlein and Americans for Prosperity, a dark-money group founded by billionaire Charles Koch and his late brother David. Americans for Prosperity has reported spending about $3 million, primarily for digital ads, canvassing, mailers and door hangers. A Better Wisconsin Together Political Fund, a union-supported electioneering group , has ponied up over $6 million to advance Crawford. In other big outlays, Soros has given $2 million to the state Democratic Party, while Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, another billionaire, gave $1.5 million. And California venture capitalist Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, donated $250,000. In Wisconsin, political parties can steer unlimited amounts to candidates. State Sen. Jeff Smith, a Democrat and a minority leader, called the spending frenzy “obscene.” “There’s no reason why campaigns should cost as much as they do,” he said. Asked for comment about the vast amount of money in the race, Crawford told ProPublica : “I’m grateful for the historic outpouring of grassroots support across Wisconsin from folks who don’t want Elon Musk controlling our Supreme Court.” Schimel’s campaign called Crawford a “hypocrite,” saying she “is playing the victim while receiving more money than any judicial candidate in American history thanks to George Soros, Reid Hoffman, and JB Pritzker funneling money to her campaign.” Quizzed Monday by a TV reporter on whether he would recuse himself if the Tesla case got to the state’s high court, Schimel did not commit, saying: “I’ll do the same thing I do in every case. I will examine whether I can truly hear that case objectively.” A decade after Wisconsin opened the floodgates to unlimited money in campaigns in 2015, some good government activists are wondering if the state has reached a tipping point. Is there any amount, they ask, at which the state’s political leaders can be persuaded to impose controls? “I honestly believe that folks have their eyes open around the money in a way that they have not previously,” Nick Ramos, executive director of the nonpartisan Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks campaign spending, told reporters during a briefing on spending in the race. A loosely organized group of campaign reformers is beginning to lay the groundwork for change. The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign recently called a Zoom meeting that included representatives of public interest groups inside and outside of Wisconsin, dark-money researchers and an election security expert. They were looking for ways to champion reform during the current legislative session. In particular, they are studying and considering what models make sense and may be achievable, including greater disclosure requirements, public financing and restricting candidates from coordinating with dark-money groups on issue ads. But Republicans say that the spending is a natural byproduct of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, which equated campaign spending with free speech and opened the spigots for big-money races. “For the most part, we don’t really, as Republicans, want to see the brakes on free speech,” said Ken Brown, past chair of the GOP Party of Racine, a city south of Milwaukee. Noting he was not speaking for the party, Brown said he does not favor spending limits. “I believe in the First Amendment. It is what it is. I believe the Citizens United decision was correct.” Asked to comment on the current system of unlimited money, Anika Rickard, a spokesperson for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, did not answer the question but instead criticized Crawford and her funders. At one point, Wisconsin was seen as providing a roadmap for reform. In 2009, the state passed the Impartial Justice Act. The legislation, enacted with bipartisan support, provided for public financing of state Supreme Court races, so candidates could run without turning to special interests for money. The push for the measure came after increased spending by outside special interests and the candidates in two state Supreme Court races: the 2007 election that cost an e stimated $5.8 million and the 2008 contest that neared $6 million , according to the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. Candidates who agreed in 2009 to public financing and spending limits received grants of up to $400,000 for the race. The money came from the Democracy Trust Fund, which was supported by a $2 income tax check-off. “​​Reformers win a fight to clean up court races,” the headline on an editorial in The Capital Times read at the time. But the law was in place for only one election, in April 2011. Both candidates in the court’s general election that year agreed to take public funding, and incumbent Justice David Prosser, a conservative, narrowly won reelection. Then Republicans eliminated funding for the measure that summer. Instead, the money was earmarked to implement a stringent voter ID law. By 2015, GOP leaders had completely overhauled the state’s campaign finance law, with Democrats in the Assembly refusing to even vote on the measure in protest. “This Republican bill opens the floodgates to unlimited spending by billionaires, by big corporations and by monied, special interests to influence our elections,” Rep. Lisa Subeck, a Democrat, said in the floor debate. Wisconsin is no longer cited as a model. Activists point to other states, including Arizona, Oregon and Rhode Island. Arizona and Oregon established disclosure measures to trace the flow of dark money, requiring campaign spenders to reveal the original source of donations. Rhode Island required ads to name not only the sponsor but the organization’s top donors so voters can better assess the message and its credibility. Amid skepticism that Wisconsin will rein in campaign spending, there may be some reason for optimism. A year ago, a proposed joint resolution in Wisconsin’s Legislature bemoaned Citizens United and the spending it had unleashed. The resolution noted that “this spending has the potential to drown out speech rights for all citizens, narrow debate, weaken federalism and self-governance in the states, and increase the risk of systemic corruption.” The resolution called for a constitutional amendment clarifying that “states may regulate the spending of money to influence federal elections.” And though it never came to a vote, 17 members of the Legislature signed on to it, a dozen of them Republicans. Eight of them are still in the Legislature, including Sen. Van Wanggaard, who voted for the 2015 bill weakening Wisconsin’s campaign finance rules. Wanggaard did not respond to a request for comment. But an aide expressed surprise — and disbelief — seeing the lawmaker’s name on the resolution.
A Global Day of Action on March 29 has been sparked by Elon Musk’s efforts to gut federal programs and agencies. On March 29, the Tesla Takedown movement will engage in a Global Day of Action at Tesla showrooms around the world. For weeks, protests outside of Tesla dealerships have grown, as participants have lashed out at Elon Musk, the leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is currently raiding and dismantling government services. The movement took off after Elon Musk’s apparent Nazi salute at an Inauguration Day event for Trump supporters. Musk has dismissed the “Sieg Heil” accusations, but his estranged daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson has not minced words on the subject, telling Teen Vogue , “Honey, we’re going to call a fig a fig, and we’re going to call a Nazi salute what it was. That shit was definitely a Nazi salute.” For Tesla Takedown organizer Joel Lava, the gesture was definitely a turning point. “The Sieg Heil was kind of the straw that broke the camel’s back for many people,” Lava told me. “When he did that, I said, ‘I got to do something.’” After seeing Musk’s repeated gesture, Lava and a friend decided to make protest signs and stand outside a Tesla showroom in Burbank, California. Lava and his companion were heartened by the response from passing cars. “We were very happy to get honks,” he said. “Then, the next day, we had four people, and it’s basically been doubling every weekend,” Lava explained. “We recently had 300 people.” Lara Starr, an organizer in Marin County, California, joined the movement in a similar manner. Since 2016, Starr has been hosting monthly gatherings that began as part of the Solidarity Sundays initiative during Trump’s first term. “We’ve been getting together once a month on Sundays, mostly to write postcards, although sometimes we have canvassed and done a couple of other actions,” Starr told me. “But after this last election, we looked at each other and said, ‘Postcards don’t seem like enough.’” In late February, the group decided it was time to protest. “We said, ‘We should turn out. We should go to Tesla.’” The group staged its first event outside a Tesla showroom on Sunday, February 23, about one month into Trump’s current term. “Our group is pretty small, so we thought there would be maybe six, eight people who came,” Starr said. However, members of a local chapter of the nonprofit Indivisible heard about the protest Starr’s group was planning and amplified the call to action. “We had 200 people show up, which was amazing,” she said. “After that action was so successful, we were like, ‘All right, same time next week.’ And so we’ve been doing it weekly since then.” In the beginning, Starr says she didn’t understand the national scope of the protests around Tesla. “We heard that there were some things happening at different Tesla locations, but I didn’t know about the Tesla Takedown hashtag. I didn’t know about any of that until after we did our first action.” Despite Musk’s conspiratorial claims about the protests, the Tesla Takedown activists and organizers I’ve spoken with have described protests that evolved organically in a decentralized manner. While the support of already-organized people, including groups like Indivisible, has been energizing for the movement, participants on the ground say they are motivated by personal outrage and fears about the future under Trump’s oligarchical regime. Starr shared that many people who have joined the protests have expressed gratitude for the opportunity to participate. “In what now seems like early days, less than a month ago, the overwhelming thing I heard from people was, ‘Thank you for giving us a place to go because we’ve been at home clenching our fists and didn’t really know what to do.’” Lava echoed Starr’s sentiments about a need for solidarity and togetherness amid so much right-wing ugliness and administrative violence. “I just didn’t want to be alone,” he said. In the Tesla Takedown movement, thousands of angry, frightened people have found a sense of collectivity. “The one good thing you can say about Musk is he has given people a symbolic and strategic place to gather and focus,” Starr said. “We can’t all go to Washington D.C. We can’t all go to Mar-a-Lago or even to a Trump property. But there are Tesla dealerships all over the country, and there are Tesla charging stations in even more places.” As the movement’s momentum grew, a TeslaTakedown website and an Action Network site were launched to support the demonstrations, linking decentralized efforts and further instigating a global web of protest. Last week, Tesla Takedown organizers hosted a virtual mass call to action on YouTube that drew more than 6,000 attendees. The event’s livestream has now been viewed more than 20,000 times. The call included elected officials, event organizers, industry experts, and celebrities such as actor and filmmaker Alex Winter, actor John Cusack, and U.S. Representative Jasmine Crockett (D-TX). Edward Niedermeyer, author of the book Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors , also spoke during the call. Niedermeyer, who has a decade of experience comparing the hype Musk generates to facts on the ground, finds Musk’s bullshit-driven approach to politics consistent with his business strategies. “The whole premise is that he’s because he’s really good at running businesses, and well, that’s just not true,” Niedermeyer told me. “If it were true, he wouldn’t be vulnerable to the Tesla Takedown. Of all of his businesses, the only one that’s ever made money is Tesla. And Tesla has been on the brink of bankruptcy basically its entire existence,” he said. “He’s never built it into something that is sustainable. Tesla’s sales are falling, and it’s about to go from being his only company that is profitable to another one of his companies that isn’t.” “Elon Musk is good at building up hype, coming up with these ideas and these visions that investors put money into,” Niedermeyer said. “He’s able to inflate these bubbles, but he’s not good at running operational businesses.” Niedermeyer says Musk’s efforts to gut federal programs and agencies reflect the billionaire’s “hack-a-thon” approach to problem-solving. “It’s this very Silicon Valley thing where you get a bunch of people together, and you feed them all Red Bull, and you keep them up, and you try and solve a big hairy problem in a big push,” he said. Musk took a similar approach to dismantling Twitter’s workforce, moderation policies, and company infrastructure after acquiring the platform. Those efforts resulted in mass layoffs, the rampant amplification of Nazi propaganda, a collapse of ad revenue, and the mass proliferation of hoaxes and misinformation. While Musk likely doesn’t see Twitter’s deterioration as a failure — since it now lets him amplify right-wing lies and propaganda at scale — the consequences of dismantling government services are far more dire. People are already dying due to Musk’s decision to put the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) “ into the wood chipper ,” and millions more will be lost if those services are not restored. As DOGE has attacked one agency after another, tens of thousands of federal workers have lost their jobs, and crucial scientific research and environmental preservation efforts have been brought to a halt. The private information of millions of Americans has been compromised, and critical government services have been imperiled. Musk, who famously swung a chainsaw in the air at the Conservative Political Action Conference to celebrate the DOGE cuts, has publicly whined about the backlash to his actions, insisting that he has only “done productive things” and has “never done anything harmful.” Like Trump, Musk projects a confident, haughty persona, but often appears thin-skinned and emotionally injured by criticism. Niedermeyer argues that Musk doesn’t actually understand the government mechanisms he’s been tampering with. “He doesn’t really understand the budgets, he doesn’t understand the budget processes, and he doesn’t understand the accounting systems that he’s working with,” Niedermeyer said. “He jumps in and pushes through with a lot of confidence. And again, this is how he runs his companies, and this is why none of them are really steadily profitable, smoothly operating, efficient, well-run businesses.” Musk, like Trump, is a showman (albeit a less skilled one). “Right now, he’s trying to save Tesla by jumping in at the end of the quarter and trying to get the president to sell Teslas from the White House lawn ,” Niedermeyer said. “He’s not there steadily running the business day-to-day so that he really understands it. He doesn’t really appreciate all the complexities of its operations. He parachutes in at the end of the quarter and puts out fires and tries to get the sales up and then goes back to doing whatever else he wanted to do.” It remains to be seen whether Musk’s efforts or Trump’s interference will save his beleaguered car company. “We’re at this very specific moment where Tesla is at a tipping point,” Niedermeyer said. “People struggle to believe that he could be the richest man in the world, while he hasn’t built a sustainably profitable business, and yet that’s the case,” he said. Niedermeyer points to an ongoing lack of innovation at Tesla, as the electric vehicle market has continued to expand, and the failed spectacle of the Cybertruck’s debut as evidence of the company’s weakness. “It’s one thing to have a car that loses money if it makes your brand look cooler — a lot of companies do that. This is the opposite,” he says of the Cybertruck, which was recently recalled in the U.S. after glued-on side panels began falling off the vehicles. Prior to going all-in on Trump’s presidential campaign, Musk was facing numerous federal probes and widespread criticism for his erratic behavior, including his impetuous purchase of Twitter, his failed attempt to abort the deal, and his use of the platform to spread right-wing conspiracies. Musk’s false promises about the pace of his companies’ innovations, including promised timelines for the development of autonomous vehicles and missions to Mars, had also damaged his credibility. “He’s in politics because the consequences of his actions are catching up with him. I mean, it’s just like Trump, right? He’s there to escape from the consequences of his actions. The political system is his refuge.” However, Niedermeyer believes this strategy may be Musk’s undoing. “He really screwed up in that sense that he got into politics. He made himself more controversial than ever at a moment when he’s more vulnerable than ever.” Tesla’s stocks have plunged in recent weeks. While the stock has rallied in recent days, some experts argue that those gains may be short-lived . Fierce competition in the electric vehicle markets of Europe and China, combined with Musk’s political infamy and the momentum of ongoing protests, increasingly threatens the company’s future. Every Tesla Takedown activist I have spoken with has mentioned the possibility of a margin call — a financial crisis that could impact Musk and Tesla if the company’s stock’s value falls to $114. As Newsweek’s Hugh Cameron explains , “A margin call occurs when a borrower no longer has enough equity to meet the broker’s minimum requirements.” Musk has used Tesla stock as collateral to secure significant personal loans. “In Musk’s case, the price of Tesla stock used as collateral would fall below a certain price point, at which point he would be forced by the broker to either deposit more funds or liquidate assets,” Cameron wrote. Protesters around the country are ready to exploit Musk’s vulnerabilities on Saturday. Meanwhile, Musk, Trump, and the right-wing media apparatus have attempted to vilify and intimidate protesters. Trump has baselessly suggested that some isolated acts of vandalism at Tesla dealerships have been paid for “by people very highly political on the left.” Attorney General Pam Bondi subsequently stated that she would prosecute “those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.” Officials with the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security, however, have issued a bulletin reporting that the “rudimentary” acts of vandalism directed at some Tesla properties do not appear to be coordinated, and should not result in the investigation of “constitutionally protected activity,” such as the Tesla Takedown protests. Bondi has nonetheless attempted to tie Crockett’s statement on a Tesla Takedown mass call that Musk should be “taken down” with the discovery of incendiary devices at a Tesla showroom in Austin, Texas. Trump has called vandals who have targeted Tesla “terrorists” and suggested that they could be sent to a prison in El Salvador. This threat, coupled with the administration’s conflation of protected speech with isolated acts of property destruction, links its hopes for the repression of protest to its illegal rendition of Venezuelan immigrants. Musk has baselessly accused Valerie Costa, an environmental activist with a group called The Troublemakers, of “committing crimes” due to her participation in the Tesla Takedown protests. The allegation led to a harassment campaign against Costa. Other Tesla Takedown activists have also experienced doxxing and harassment, but the participants I spoke with appear undeterred. As protester Florence Chan recently told the San Francisco Chronicle , “It just makes me and a lot of other people more angry. It’s almost like a recruiting tool. They are recruiting people to this protest.” Lava is similarly unmoved by the administration’s threats. “I’m living with no F’s to give,” Lava told me. “When you declare yourself a Nazi or do the Sig Heil, that’s a direct threat against my family. It’s not just about being angry. I’m Jewish, and to see the Sig Heil triggers something that we learned since we were in preschool.” Lava acknowledged that he has been subject to surveillance for his efforts. “They have facial recognition software. That’s the world we live in, and I just don’t care. So I’ve been like, ‘Screw it.’ We are there to destroy Tesla’s brand. And we’re getting results.” Niedermeyer hopes that the defiant attitude of protesters will prevail and that people will converge on Tesla dealerships in great numbers this weekend. “Wall Street hedge funds pay attention to crowd sizes. So if we can do a big push on that day and turn out bigger crowds, they will notice, and it will cause people to sell the stock,” he said. “It’s a huge opportunity, and everything we can do here makes a difference.” Note: You can find a Tesla Takedown protest near you here .
As Trump attacks voting rights with an executive order, Musk is virtually bribing voters in a key state election. After spending over a quarter of a billion dollars on Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign, Elon Musk is pouring money into a Supreme Court election in Wisconsin. Musk has spent more than $18 million to support Trump-backed candidate Brad Schimel over liberal Susan Crawford and has been paying Wisconsin voters $100 to help flip the state’s top court. This election could impact abortion rights, unions and Republicans’ ability to keep gerrymandered districts in place to control Congress. “The level of corruption at play here, the level of money at play here, really is a warning sign for what’s happening to our democracy,” says Ari Berman, voting rights correspondent for Mother Jones magazine. This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman. Not content with spending more than a quarter of a billion dollars to elect Donald Trump, we look now at how the richest man in the world, senior adviser to President Trump, Elon Musk, is pouring money into an election in Wisconsin. Musk has spent more than $18 million to support the Republican Brad Schimel over Democrat Susan Crawford and has been paying Wisconsin voters $100 each to help flip the Wisconsin Supreme Court. This would allow Republicans to keep gerrymandered districts in place and control Congress. If Democrats retake the House, they could investigate Musk, DOGE and his millions in government contracts. For more, we’re joined by Ari Berman, voting rights correspondent for Mother Jones magazine, author of Minority Rule: The Right-Wing Attack on the Will of the People — and the Fight to Resist It . His recent pieces are headlined “Elon Musk Revealed Why He’s Spending Millions to Flip the Wisconsin Supreme Court” and “The Wisconsin Supreme Court Election Is a Referendum on Elon Musk.” So much is happening with voting rights. Let’s start in Wisconsin. Then we’ll move on from there. Ari, can you lay out what’s at stake, why Wisconsin is about the country, and then, of course, will affect the world? ARI BERMAN: Well, good morning, Amy. The Wisconsin Supreme Court is important in its own right, because this election on April 1st will determine which party and side controls the ideological majority of the court. And that will decide things like the fate of Wisconsin’s 1849 abortion ban, laws restricting labor rights, illegality of Wisconsin’s congressional maps, which could decide control of Congress. But it’s taken on much more significance, because Elon Musk is now spending over $20 million to try to flip the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which is a record for any state judicial race in the history of the United States. And it really has become a test of whether Musk can buy Wisconsin, like he bought the White House, and can extend his plan for oligarchy to the states, or whether Democrats can fight back and strike a tangible blow against him, and whether there can be a reaction to all of the things that he’s done in Washington, that he’s now trying to do to the states. And so, it’s an extremely important race in the state, in one of the most important swing states in the country, but it really has taken on a tremendous amount of national significance since Musk got so involved in this Wisconsin Supreme Court race. AMY GOODMAN: And explain. What does paying $100 to voters mean? What’s that about? ARI BERMAN: So, Musk is paying voters $100 a pop to sign a petition opposing, quote-unquote, “activist judges.” And I just saw that he has now given a million dollars to a supposedly random winner of the petition signing, which is just a staggering amount of money. And he’s going to keep doing that every two days until the election. And this is just a crazy scheme in a state Supreme Court race. Remember, Amy, this is about electing judges. These are people that are supposed to be impartial in terms of how they rule. And basically, what Musk is doing is he’s taking the playbook that he used, which was very controversial, very legally suspect, certainly ethically dubious, in terms of getting Donald Trump back in the White House, and he’s trying to use it in a state Supreme Court election in Wisconsin. And we’ve never seen this kind of thing in a judicial race before. We’ve never seen this kind of money in Wisconsin before or any other state Supreme Court race. We’ve never seen these kind of tactics in a state Supreme Court race before. And so, just the level of corruption at play here, the level of money at play here, really is a warning sign for what’s happening to our democracy. AMY GOODMAN: So, you’re a voting rights specialist journalist. And this comes amidst a slew of other election news. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments against Louisiana’s voting map that includes two majority-Black districts, that could also help shape the balance of power in the House. And President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday to overhaul U.S. elections and stop the counting of votes after Election Day, including absentee ballots sent by mail. And on Wednesday, Utah’s Republican Governor Spencer Cox signed law to end the state’s popular universal vote-by-mail election system. If you could talk about all of that? ARI BERMAN: Yeah, so, I think the most significant of those three so far is President Trump’s sweeping and really unprecedented executive order, which would give the president the authority that he really doesn’t have under the Constitution. The Constitution gives the states and Congress the power to set the rules for federal elections. Trump is trying to take that power for himself, in a really crazy voter suppression scheme that would make it harder to vote in so many different ways. It would require proof of citizenship to register to vote, which could disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans who don’t have ready access to those documents, like a U.S. passport or potentially birth certificates or naturalization papers. It would hamper vote by mail by saying that if ballots are postmarked by Election Day, they won’t count if they arrive after Election Day, which is currently the law in 18 states. It would put Elon Musk in charge of searching voter rolls and searching for suspected voter fraud, which could just lead to incredible abuse and further access of sensitive voter information. So, really, the president is trying to do an illegal power grab that would provide voter suppression on steroids and take away so much power that is currently reserved for the states and for Congress and make it so much harder for people to vote, at a time that we’re entering a really crucial election cycle. That’s on top of the fact that before the Louisiana Supreme Court, white voters are basically trying to dismantle a second majority-Black district in that state to try to turn the Voting Rights Act on its head, take away representation for Black voters. Republicans at the state level are continuing to make it harder to vote, through things like chipping away at mail voting, like in places like Utah, where it’s very popular and widely used. So, there’s a lot of disturbing things on the democracy front. And I think this all really fits together, which is that there is just this five-alarm fire for democracy happening all over the country, and it’s taking many, many forms. One of the most tangible forms it’s taking is the attempt to try to restrict participation in elections and to try to put in place a form of oligarchy instead of a form of democracy. You see that in Wisconsin with Elon Musk trying to buy the Supreme Court race. You see it in Washington with Trump issuing executive orders that are clearly unconstitutional. You see it at the state level with how Republicans are ripping away voting rights. So I see a through line to all of these different anti-democratic tactics. AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, there’s Trump’s new executive order that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. Ari Berman, I want to thank you so much for being with us, voting rights correspondent for Mother Jones magazine. Next up, we look at the backgrounds of some of Trump’s closest and most powerful allies, the South African-born billionaires Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. Back in 30 seconds.
Critics say the bill would accelerate their plan of gutting Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, among other things. The top Democrat on the U.S. House committee tasked with holding the Trump administration accountable said Tuesday during a debate on a Republican proposal that the GOP knows President Donald Trump cannot legally “‘delete’ whole federal agencies” or “take a chainsaw to beloved programs like Social Security and Medicaid.” “Congressional Republicans also know these dangerous, deeply unpopular cuts would never be approved by Congress through regular order,” said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. “So now they’ve brought us H.R. 1295, the so-called Reorganizing Government Act, in a desperate attempt to circumvent the normal congressional process.” The bill , said Connolly, would more accurately be called the “Dismantling Government Act,” with its resurrection of a “long-dormant statute as a Trojan horse to give President Trump and Elon Musk unprecedented, filibuster-proof authority to eliminate federal departments and agencies, statutory programs, government services, and regulatory protections that promote the health and well-being of American families.” H.R. 1295 was approved to advance out of the committee in a party-line vote, with Republicans voting to give Trump authority that has not been granted by Congress since 1984, allowing him to submit a plan to restructure federal agencies. Congress would be required to vote on the plan within 90 days and the proposals would not be subject to a filibuster, allowing the GOP-controlled Senate to approve the dismantling of agencies with a simple majority. Between 1932 and 1984, Congress periodically gave presidents limited authority to reorganize limited portions of the government, but lawmakers have denied requests from both Democratic and Republican presidents to renew the authority. Under the “Dismantling Government Act,” Trump would be permitted to make sweeping changes to agencies through December 31, 2026, and the previous limitation barring presidents from abolishing agencies would be removed. In his opening statement during the committee’s debate on the legislation Tuesday, Connolly warned that “the Dismantling Government Act would grant Donald Trump and Elon Musk a filibuster-proof pathway to get their reckless actions blessed by Congress, and we already know exactly what they’ll do with that power.” Republicans are finally admitting Trump & Musk don’t have the authority to destroy the government, so they’re trying to change that. Watch RM @GerryConnolly ’s opening statement on @GOPoversight ’s partisan #DismantlingGovernment Act pic.twitter.com/geGMIzbzuW The Republicans proposed the legislation amid numerous attempts by Trump and Musk, the billionaire tech CEO and megadonor he appointed to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), to dismantle federal agencies and freeze government funding — some of which have been blocked by federal courts . “The reason they are pushing for this bill is because Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and DOGE have already been found consistently to be acting outside of the law in their mass layoffs and agency closures by the courts,” said Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz). “Now, instead of defending their own powers, congressional Republicans are pushing forward this bill to hand over their powers to the president.” Under the Dismantling Government Act, Trump and Musk would be granted filibuster-proof, unilateral power to: “Since the start of the Trump-Musk regime they have engaged in shocking abuses of power and taken a wrecking ball to the services and earned benefits regular Americans depend on to pay for more tax breaks for their billionaire donors and expand their own fortunes,” said Tony Carrk, executive director of Accountable.US. “This bill, better called the Dismantling Government Act, is a power grab that would greenlight an enormous expansion of presidential power, help Trump and Musk skirt checks and balances, and accelerate their ultimate agenda of gutting Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security to offset tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.” “The Trump-Musk administration’s billionaire-first agenda has already shifted the balance of power to help corporate special interests, and away from everyday Americans — this bill would rubber-stamp unchecked abuses of power even further,” Carrk added. Accountable.US is one of 200 civil society groups, representing millions of Americans, that signed a letter calling on Congress to reject the legislation. “H.R. 1295 not only creates a fast track to dismantle these critical entities but does so by exempting these efforts from the filibuster, thus allowing the Senate to eliminate these agencies and their critical functions with a simple majority. In other words, this bill provides a fast track to the destruction of the critical entities that ensure our families are safe, our workers have protections, our environment is protected, and our markets are fair,” wrote the groups, which form the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards, on Monday. “The American public expects Congress to make government work more effectively and preserve the separation of powers,” the coalition added, “not give presidents ‘carte blanche’ to dismantle government agencies and institutions.”
It’s really hard to imagine what their endgame is, other than destroying our Social Security system, says Nancy Altman. The Social Security benefits of millions of people in the United States are at risk as the Trump administration institutes drastic changes billed as “anti-fraud” measures, but which critics say are aimed at weakening the popular program and potentially laying the groundwork to privatize it. The Social Security Administration has already shuttered dozens of offices across the country and is laying off thousands of workers. At the same time, the agency is demanding people make more in-office visits for routine business. The changes are part of government-wide efforts led by billionaire Elon Musk and DOGE, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. “They are destabilizing the program,” says Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works and chair of the Strengthen Social Security Coalition. “It’s really hard to imagine what they have in mind, what their endgame is, other than destroying our Social Security system.” We also speak with Jacobin staff writer Branko Marcetic, who says Trump’s nominee to head the Social Security Administration, financial services executive Frank Bisignano, has a reputation for slashing costs and pushing out staff. “All of that is a pretty grim portent” of his plans for the Social Security Administration, if Bisignano is confirmed, says Marcetic. “The people that are going to be hurt by it are the actual Social Security beneficiaries.” This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: We begin today looking at how the Social Security Administration is considering drastic new measures that could disrupt benefit payments to millions of Americans. This is according to an internal memo first obtained by the political newsletter Popular Information . Authored earlier this month by Acting Deputy Social Security Administration Commissioner Doris Diaz, the changes proposed in the memo would force millions of customers to file claims in person at a field office rather than over the phone. According to the memo, customers applying for retirement and disability benefits would be required for the first time to verify their identity through an online system. If their identity can’t be verified online, they would have to visit a field office in person. A day before the memo was sent, The Washington Post reported Social Security Administration was considering ending telephone service for all claims, under pressure from DOGE, the Department of Government Efficiency. Hours after the Washington Post report came out, the agency issued a press release claiming telephone services would not be eliminated. The proposed changes to Social Security come as DOGE is targeting the agency for staff cuts of more than 12%. Meanwhile, Trump’s billionaire Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has sparked outrage after repeatedly suggesting only fraudsters would complain if Social Security checks don’t go out on time. COMMERCE SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Let’s say Social Security didn’t send out their checks this month. My mother-in-law, who’s 94, she wouldn’t call and complain. She just wouldn’t. She’d think something got messed up, and she’ll get it next month. A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling and complaining. AMY GOODMAN: This comes as self-professed DOGE person, former corporate CEO Frank Bisignano was grilled for more than two hours Tuesday by the Senate Finance Committee at his confirmation hearing to lead the Social Security agency. This is one exchange with him and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: Suppose this same 65-year-old calls the help line to apply for Social Security, but he’s told about the new DOGE rule, so he has to go online or in person. He can’t drive. He has trouble with the website, so he waits until his niece can get a day off to take him to the local Social Security office. But DOGE closed that office, so they have to drive two hours to get to the next closest office. When they get there, there are only two people who are staffing a 50-person line, so he doesn’t even make it to the front of the line before the office closes, and he has to come back. Now, let’s assume it takes our fellow three months to straighten this out, and he misses a total of $5,000 in benefits checks, which, by law, he will never get back. So, Mr. Bisignano, is that a benefit cut? FRANK BISIGNANO: Well, first of all, Senator, I enjoyed — SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: Is that a benefit cut? FRANK BISIGNANO: I enjoyed. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: I’m sorry, my time is limited here. That’s an easy question. Yes or no? Is it a benefit cut? FRANK BISIGNANO: I have no intent to have anything like that happen on my watch, Ma’am. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: I understand that. Is it a benefit cut? FRANK BISIGNANO: I’m not sure what to call it. It sounds like a horrible situation. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: Is the person getting the $5,000 they were legally entitled to? FRANK BISIGNANO: That was your scenario. And so — SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: So, are they getting $5,000 they were legally entitled to? FRANK BISIGNANO: I don’t know. AMY GOODMAN: Social Security provides crucial economic security to more than 70 million people and accounts for over half the income of most people over age 65. In one of many protests nationwide, dozens of mostly older adults protested Friday outside a Nashville, Tennessee, field office they say is already understaffed, with long wait times, is on a list of 47 field offices DOGE plans to close. PROTESTER: We’re being told, and everything that they say that they’re trying not to do — and one of the things they’re saying is that they’re not going to attack Social Security. And yet all the actions they’re taking is attacking Social Security. AMY GOODMAN: For more, we’re joined by two guests. In Chicago, Branko Marcetic is with us, Jacobin staff writer, where his recent piece is headlined “Trump’s Nominated Social Security Head Knows How to Cut.” But we begin in Washington, D.C., with Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, chair of the Strengthen Social Security Coalition, the co-author, with Eric Kingson, of Social Security Works for Everyone!: Protecting and Expanding the Insurance Americans Love and Count On . Altman has spent the last half-century working on Social Security. After our interview, she’ll be at a rally near the Capitol about defending Social Security. Nancy Altman, welcome to Democracy Now! Let’s begin with you before you go off to this rally. It looks like the commerce secretary, the billionaire Lutnick, who says that his 94-year-old mother wouldn’t complain if she didn’t get her Social Security check — she’s the mother of a billionaire — only fraudsters would, is laying the groundwork for people to start to expect, perhaps, that they won’t get their checks. Can you explain what’s happening? NANCY ALTMAN: It’s really outrageous. Donald Trump has a problem. He ran around the country, flooding the swing states, saying he would not cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, but in his first term he proposed cuts to those programs every single year. Now, those cuts didn’t go through. So what’s he doing now? He’s claiming that there’s enormous amount of fraud, which is a lie — there is vanishingly small amounts of fraud — so when he cuts your benefits, he’ll be saying he’s cutting fraud, he’s not cutting the benefits that you have earned. AMY GOODMAN: So, talk about what is happening at this point. You have, first, the threats of phone service. And who are the people who use Social Security, and what it means not to be able to speak on the phone? Then you have to go to a satellite office. Perhaps that office is going to be closed or understaffed. You have to wait maybe a month to be able to go in. And the issue is they’re closing these offices all over. What’s happening to Social Security as we speak? NANCY ALTMAN: You know, it’s all being done behind closed doors. And what’s being done — because we’re following it very closely and talking to the people who work at Social Security — is they are destabilizing the program. The agency could wind up collapsing. You’ve got the DOGE minions, Elon Musk’s, you know, 20-year-olds, running around Social Security. They’ve been doing it since this new administration. They’ve been forcing people out, firing people, hollowing it out. And, frighteningly, they have all of our most personal data, and no one knows what they have in store for that. AMY GOODMAN: But, Nancy Altman, this is going to alienate, you know, MAGA Americans who get Social Security. We’re talking about tens of millions of Americans, as well as Democrats, progressives, independents. So, what is the response to — for example, you’re organizing. Who’s going out and protesting around the country right now at these over — understaffed, overworked folks at these field offices, and the possibility of them closing? NANCY ALTMAN: Yes, it’s really hard to imagine what they have in mind, what their endgame is, other than destroying our Social Security system. As you said, there are over 70 million Americans who receive monthly benefits, that they have earned. They tend to be — they are seniors, people with disabilities. It’s the nation’s largest children’s program. Many of them have mobility issues. If they can’t use the phone, they really are excluded from getting those benefits. It’s really an outrage. And we’re trying to get the word out. And I’m so appreciative that you’re having this segment, because it’s really important. I don’t want to scare people, because people are dependent on those benefits to pay their rent, to pay their food. And I don’t want to scare people, but I do want people learned. Everyone should be rising up and saying, “Hands off Social Security.” AMY GOODMAN: I want to go to Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, grilling Frank Bisignano at his confirmation hearing to head the Social Security Administration, Wyden citing a tip from a whistleblower and asking Bisignano if he was bringing on DOGE team members who could access Social Security beneficiaries’ personal information. SEN. RON WYDEN: So, according to the whistleblower, you personally intervened to get key DOGE officials installed at the agency who have masterminded this shipwreck that we’re dealing today. Did you talk to anyone at Social Security about these changes? FRANK BISIGNANO: I have never talked to Mr. Dudek. I have talked to Mike Russo, and I’ve said that to your staff when they asked me. I know Mike Russo. He was the CIO of Shift4, and he was the CIO at Oracle for Mark Hurd. And I know him for 20 years. I don’t know him as a DOGE person; I know him as a CIO. AMY GOODMAN: So, Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, can you respond to what the nominated head of Social Security Administration is saying, Frank Bisignano? NANCY ALTMAN: He’s bobbing and weaving. Here’s the truth. He has described himself as a DOGE guy. Now, what that means is, although it’s the government of efficiency, it’s bringing in inefficiency, it’s bringing in waste, and it’s opening the possibility of massive fraud through identity theft and so forth. He, from the very beginning, has been very aggressive. He’s still a private citizen. He’s been nominated. He has no role in the government. But he has been all over the Social Security Administration. He’s been working hand in glove with Elon Musk to hollow out the agency and to make these changes, where you can’t — where you no longer can change your routing number, and you can’t finish your claims by phone. You have to go into field offices, which, of course, they’re trying to terminate all the field offices. And he is really a part of what is going on, and is bobbing and weaving so he can get confirmed. AMY GOODMAN: I want to bring in Branko Marcetic into this conversation, the Jacobin staff writer. Your recent piece , Branko, is “Trump’s Nominated Social Security Head Knows How to Cut.” Tell us who he is. BRANKO MARCETIC: Yeah, Bisignano was the CEO of Fiserv from 2020 to now. Before that, he was the CEO of a different payment processing company, First Data. It was a credit card payment processor. I think people, when they think brought on because he has experience in terms of payments, large amounts of payments every single day, every second being processed, therefore he’ll be good for something like the Social Security Administration, where that is so much of the responsibility. But the thing about Bisignano is that his record as CEO of these companies is relevant in another way. He was responsible for massive cuts to staff levels, to offices, to benefits for workers at these companies — basically, very much the same kind of thing that we’ve been seeing DOGE doing at the Social Security Administration already. So, anyone who was thinking that if Bisignano is going to be brought in as the commissioner of the Social Security Administration, that there was going to be a change in direction from what we’ve seen, that the administration, the Trump administration, was going to make good on the president’s promises to leave Social Security untouched, I think, should be very worried by his appointment. AMY GOODMAN: If you could talk about Bisignano’s corporate time as CEO of Fiserv? You write, “Fiserv’s Glass Door reviews are riddled with bitter personal animus to Bisignano specifically: ‘The decision making in this company has been extremely erratic since Frank Bisignano took over as CEO.’” Another one, “Once Frank took over, it became a horrible place to work for.” Another said, “Frank and his squad, not the greatest tbh” — to be honest. Another one, “The CEO is a micromanager and only cares about the stock price.” Another, “Replace Frank with a leader who listens.” Another, ”CEO could care less about employees. They are all a widget and an expense to him. Mr Scrooge at his finest,” concluded one. And other said, “Frank, please go buy an island and move there, never to return.” Talk about the significance of this, and then how it fits in, Branko, to being the head of the Social Security Administration. BRANKO MARCETIC: I mean, there is a deep, deep dislike, to put it mildly, for Bisignano among the workers of Fiserv. I mean, what comes up in these Glass Door reviews, I’d recommend people go and look at them. There’s thousands upon thousands, most of them well before anyone knew that he was going to get nominated for Trump’s administration. And they all paint a pretty similar picture. Not only do they think that Bisignano is a terrible CEO, someone who has done all these massive cuts so that he can just pour billions of dollars of profit back into stock buybacks — and by the way, he’s a massive shareholder in Fiserv and actually sold $25 million worth of shares, so he is the one profiting directly from this — but they also talk about the kind of effect that these cuts have had on them as workers, as people trying to make Fiserv, you know, do what it’s meant to. And what they say is that experienced people, some of the most capable workers, have either been fired because they didn’t want to relocate when offices were closed and consolidated in places that were advantageous for tax incentives, or they left because they found that the working were so inflexible and so inconvenient that they may as well just go somewhere else. And so you had this massive brain drain from Fiserv, while at the same time people complained about their working conditions getting worse, their benefits being cut. They talked about having to take on a much bigger workload and having to make that work, even though they had now a far smaller staff. All of that is a pretty grim portent, I would say, if this is what Bisignano is being brought into the Social Security Administration to do, which I think he is. It suggests that the people who are left, who are not fired from this massive cost-cutting operation by DOGE, are going to be left trying to scramble and keep their heads above water despite the fact that they have far less capability to do so. And the people that are going to be hurt by it are the actual Social Security beneficiaries. AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you both for being with us, but ask Branko to stay with us for our next segment. Branko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer. We’ll link to your piece . And Nancy Altman is president of Social Security Works. She’s going off to a rally to preserve Social Security. Next up, Democratic lawmakers demand Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and national security adviser Michael Waltz resign, after they discussed plans to bomb Yemen on an unsecure Signal group chat and included a journalist in that chat. Stay with us.
Musk also has a financial stake in the election, as the state’s highest court could rule soon over regulations on Tesla. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and the largest donor to President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign , has poured millions of dollars into Wisconsin’s upcoming Supreme Court race — the latest example of the tech billionaire exerting political power to preserve his own business interests. Musk is by far the largest single donor in Wisconsin’s current judicial election cycle. The April 1 election will likely play a major role in the future makeup of Congress — and tipping the balance of the court could also result in justices lifting state regulations that affect Musk’s car company, Tesla. As it currently stands, Wisconsin’s Supreme Court has a slight liberal majority , with four liberal justices and three conservative justices. A liberal justice is ending her current term without seeking reelection, which means that, if conservative Judge Brad Schimel wins over liberal Judge Susan Crawford, the conservative bloc will become the majority. During a live discussion on his social media site X, Musk told U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) why he has invested $19 million in the race . “This is a very important race for many reasons. The most consequential is that will decide how congressional districts are drawn in Wisconsin, which if the other candidate wins, instead of Justice Schimel, then the Democrats will attempt to redraw the districts and cause Wisconsin to lose two Republican seats,” Musk said . He further described the race as “a big deal given that the congressional majority is so razor-thin.” Democrats have acknowledged that the race could help their party on the national stage, as Republicans have long benefited from gerrymandered districts, which last year resulted in a 6-2 majority over Democrats in the state congressional delegation . The Princeton Gerrymandering Project has demonstrated that the district maps are drawn in Republicans’ favor, rating them an “F” in terms of partisan fairness . After the Wisconsin Supreme Court shifted to a liberal balance a few years ago, it heard cases challenging political maps. While the court eventually ruled in favor of a redraw of state legislative boundaries , it refused to hear a case dealing with the congressional districts , as a newly appointed liberal justice abstained from deciding on the issue due to not being in office when it was first brought up. Conservative bloc justices on the court said it “likely won’t be long” before there is another challenge to congressional maps. Wisconsin is a “purple” state, meaning its statewide races are often very close. In the last three presidential races, for example, the elections were decided by 1 percent margins or smaller, with Trump winning in 2024 and 2016 and former President Joe Biden winning in 2020 . But in the state legislature, Republicans, benefiting from gerrymandered maps the party drew in 2011 and beyond, had nearly a two-thirds majority. After the state Supreme Court ordered districts to be redrawn, the split in the state legislature became more aligned with the electorate’s purple status , with the GOP having a majority of +9 seats in the state Assembly after the 2024 election rather than their previous margin of +29 seats two years prior. The Wisconsin Supreme Court could indeed rule on gerrymandering in its next term. It also has the potential to shift the state’s standards on reproductive rights and abortion access, union and workers’ rights, and voting rights — as well as regulatory standards relating to the sale of Tesla vehicles in the state. Current Wisconsin law forbids car manufacturers from also being able to own dealerships . Tesla, which is owned by Musk, failed to receive a regulatory pass regarding that standard, and the company is currently suing the state over the law, which it says is unconstitutional. The case will undoubtedly make its way to the state Supreme Court. If Schimel wins the race over Crawford, he would not have to recuse himself from that case, even after benefiting from millions of dollars in indirect donations from Musk. That’s because, under Wisconsin’s judicial code, justices decide for themselves whether they should recuse from cases based on conflicts of interest . During the recent event with Musk, Johnson, Wisconsin’s senior U.S. senator, recognized how the billionaire’s $19 million in donations to various political action committees and the state Republican Party has helped Schimel. Much of that money was used to fund a smear campaign that has included false or misleading ads against Crawford . “If we do win , we have to thank Elon for all the support he’s given this race,” Johnson said this week .
Earlier this month, Musk singled out USPS for privatization at a Morgan Stanley conference. The embattled head of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Louis DeJoy abruptly resigned from his position as postmaster on Monday — just weeks after Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) paid a visit to the agency to force it to adopt agency-shrinking measures. In a statement , DeJoy did not give a reason for his resignation. He handed the job to Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino as an interim measure while the postal board chooses a permanent successor. “I am confident that Doug will continue our positive momentum,” DeJoy said. “I also have no doubt that the entirety of the Postal Service will aggressively shape its future and become more efficient, capable and competitive as it continuously changes and improves to best serve the American public.” Earlier this month, Musk told attendees at a Morgan Stanley conference that the federal government should privatize the USPS. President Donald Trump has expressed support for the idea. On the surface, DeJoy and Musk seem to have shared goals: to make widespread cuts to spending at government agencies, in this case USPS, to make them more supposedly “efficient” while, in actuality, eroding a public service. However, Musk and Trump seem to have forced DeJoy out anyway. The American Postal Workers Union (APWU) said that DeJoy was just one cut on the way to privatization. “Make no mistake, Louis DeJoy was forced out by a presidential administration that is intent on breaking up and selling off the public Postal Service. Reports from last month made clear that the White House has plans for a hostile takeover of the Postal Service,” said APWU President Mark Dimondstein in a statement . “As I said then, any attack on the Postal Service is part of the ongoing oligarchs’ coup against the vital public services our members and other public servants provide the country. We know that privatized postal services will lead to higher postage prices, and lower service quality to the public,” Dimondstein went on. “No matter who leads the USPS, it is — and must remain — the People’s Postal Service.” USPS employees , experts and advocacy groups say that this would be disastrous for the American shipping and mail system, as well as the American public. Banks are “salivat” over the idea to “ransack” mail service, as watchdog Revolving Door Project wrote in an analysis of a Wells Fargo proposal for privatization this month. Per the analysis, privatization would raise postage prices, potentially doubling them, while also leading to mass layoffs. These layoffs could drastically reduce the number of unionized employees in the U.S., as 91 percent of USPS’s 640,000 employees are unionized. At the same time, mail service itself would be compromised, as private companies aren’t beholden to the USPS’s mandate to ensure that every domestic address can be reached by reasonably priced services — potentially cutting off rural communities from being able to access mail service for crucial things like medication or ballots. “If they follow through on privatization threats, Musk and Trump will be attacking an American institution older than the country itself and one of the few agencies explicitly authorized by the Constitution,” Revolving Door Project said. DeJoy, a top Republican fundraiser and donor , took the helm at USPS in 2020 after being elected by the majority-conservative postal board. He immediately embarked on a deeply unpopular plan to slash the postal service to run it more like a business — despite USPS existing as a public service, and not a pathway for profits — ahead of the 2020 election, in which mail service was critical as the COVID-19 pandemic caused a surge of demand for mail-in ballots. Since then, four years into DeJoy’s 10-year plan, there have been signs of major delays in mail delivery across the country. DeJoy had announced that he was stepping down last month, but the resignation on Monday was relatively abrupt. Musk’s DOGE cronies had demanded widespread access to the agency’s technology and systems . DeJoy reportedly refused, as The Washington Post reports, and DOGE workers went on to demand that the USPS bypass Congress to make changes to the service. Earlier this month, DeJoy announced plans to cut 10,000 USPS workers and slash $3.5 billion from its operating costs, in compliance with Donald Trump and Musk’s plan for mass government layoffs that have been, in some places, ruled likely illegal . Meanwhile, in recent days, the Trump administration has reportedly been meeting with Jim Cochrane, the head of a trade association representing private shipping companies like Amazon, DHL and FedEx, The Washington Post reports.
One study found that 2 in 5 older Americans rely on Social Security as their sole means of income. Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick claimed in an interview last week that beneficiaries of Social Security payments wouldn’t complain if they didn’t receive their checks this month — and that anyone who did speak up would be exposing themselves as a “fraudster.” The comments from Lutnick — one of the many billionaires in the Trump administration — expose how out of touch he is with the Americans who rely solely on Social Security payments to fund their retirements. Lutnick made the remarks during an appearance on the “All-In” podcast on Thursday , saying that his mother-in-law would not complain if the Social Security Administration (SSA) suddenly stopped making payments. “She’d think something got messed up, and she’ll get it next month,” Lutnick said about his mother-in-law, who lives in a townhouse with him and his wife on the Upper East Side of Manhattan . Lutnick then disparaged anyone who would complain about delays. “A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling and complaining,” he said. Lutnick added : Anybody who’s been in the payment system and the processes, who knows the easiest way to find the fraudster is to stop payments and listen, because whoever screams is the one stealing. Because my mother-in-law’s not calling, come on, your mother, 80-year-olds, 90-year-olds, they trust the government. Data on Social Security recipients indicates that Lutnick’s assertions are wrong — many retirees likely would file complaints over a payment delay, as many rely on those payments to survive. Nearly 3 in 10 Baby Boomers and nearly a quarter of individuals from the Silent Generation (the generation preceding boomers), live paycheck-to-paycheck, one study found . Another report, published by the National Institute on Retirement Security in 2020, found that 40 percent of older Americans rely solely on Social Security payments as their primary income source. Lutnick’s comments come as the SSA recently announced that, starting next week, phone call verifications would no longer be an option for people seeking to enroll in Social Security or make changes to their enrollment. Instead, individuals will have to alter or apply for their benefits online or in person at local offices. Online options aren’t always preferable to retirees, as many are skeptical about sending personal information over the internet. And meeting in person poses its own difficulties — especially with potential cuts and firings looming within the SSA. The new standards “will substantially delay access to their earned benefits,” said Kathleen Romig , director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Trump's statements ambiguously suggest that those peacefully protesting against Tesla and Elon Musk could be targeted. President Donald Trump and members of his administration are describing a small number of vandalous actions taken against Tesla properties as “domestic terrorism,” threatening participants with exceptional prison sentences and the possibility of cruel and unusual punishment. Tesla is owned by “Department of Government Efficiency” head Elon Musk, who was also Trump’s largest donor during the 2024 presidential campaign . Musk has also sensationalized the attacks on the vehicles and storefronts, stating last week that he couldn’t “walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire.” There have been at least 10 instances of property destruction on Tesla properties since inauguration day. Last Thursday, Trump stated on social media that those “sabotaging” Tesla “stand a very good chance of going to jail for up to twenty years.” He also promoted a conspiracy theory that these attacks were somehow related to each other and being financed by an unknown group. Various officials have told NBC News that there is “no evidence of any coordination around the attacks.” An FBI memo published last week states that the attacks “appear to have been conducted by lone offenders.” Trump has also stated that he could send those convicted of harming Tesla properties to foreign prisons. “I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla,” Trump said on Truth Social , adding that those charged and convicted could be sent to “the prisons of El Salvador,” which he sarcastically described as being “famous for such lovely conditions.” Trump has also falsely alleged peaceful actions against Tesla are “illegal,” describing planned protests of the company in those terms earlier this month . John Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, told NBC News that “The idea that you could take Americans who have not been charged with a terrorism offense, let alone convicted of it, and talk about deporting them to a foreign country to serve prison sentences is incredibly chilling.” In a statement to reporters at the White House, Trump dismissed comparisons of Tesla vandalism to the January 6, 2021, attacks. “These are terrorists,” Trump said of the Tesla attacks . “You didn’t have anything like that on January 6th.” Hundreds of Trump loyalists violently stormed the U.S. Capitol on that day in an attempt to delay or overturn the 2020 presidential election results and keep Trump in office, which caused an estimated $1.5 million in property damage. United States Attorney General Pam Bondi announced federal charges against three individuals who had caused “violent destruction of Tesla properties.” She described the attacks as a “wave of domestic terrorism” against the company. Notably, there is no federal statute that deals with “domestic terrorism.” However, prosecutors have used the term to influence the outcome of a trial or to seek longer sentences after a criminal conviction is decided. Republicans already appear to be using Trump’s ambiguity to delegitimize and threaten persecution of any action taken against Tesla — including boycotts or nonviolent protests. In Tennessee, for example, Republican State Sen. Brent Taylor derided a “Tesla Takedown” protest event that had occurred over the weekend, calling it “evil and illegal” and “leftist terrorism.” Coordinators of these events have gone to great lengths to emphasize that they are nonviolent, peaceful and lawful demonstrations. “Tesla Takedown is a peaceful protest movement,” a description of the events states . “We oppose violence, vandalism and destruction of property. This protest is a lawful exercise of our First Amendment right to peaceful assembly.” Tesla Takedown protests are being held to demonstrate against Musk’s decimation of government agencies and departments through budget cuts and firing of government workers. Several judges and legal experts have said many of Musk’s cuts and firings are likely unlawful.
Musk’s donations could influence Republican lawmakers’ decision-making on future legislation. Elon Musk, whose Trump administration-endorsed “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) cuts have been challenged (and sometimes successfully blocked) in courtrooms across the country, has donated to several Republican members of Congress who have called for the impeachment of judges issuing those rulings. Musk has given the maximum allowable amount — $6,600 — to at least seven Republicans who have expressed support for impeaching or taking other actions against those judges. Those lawmakers include Reps. Eli Crane (R-Arizona), Lauren Boebert (R-Colorado), Andy Ogles (R-Tennessee), Andrew Clyde (R-Georgia), Derrick Van Orden (R-Wisconsin) and Brandon Gill (R-Texas), as well as Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). Despite the clear implications of corruption, the Republicans who received the donations from Musk — the world’s richest person — have insisted that there wasn’t a quid pro quo of any kind. “We didn’t so Elon Musk would give us a campaign donation,” Crane said in an interview about receiving the funds. “But I think it’s great that individuals like Elon are throwing support behind those of us willing to take action.” Clyde also said that he had “no prior knowledge” that Musk would respond to his calls for impeachment with a donation, but that he is “very thankful that he did.” Musk has been vocal about his desire to see judges impeached for opposing his and the Trump administration’s actions. “There needs to be an immediate wave of judicial impeachments, not just one,” Musk wrote in a post on X . President Donald Trump has also called for judges blocking his orders — including his blatant challenges to the Constitution — to be impeached for engaging in the centuries-old practice of judicial review. Trump derided Federal District Judge James Boasberg, for example, for placing a temporary block on the use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which the administration was using to expedite deportations. Trump described Boasberg as a “Radical Left Lunatic of a Judge” and claimed that his judicial orders were illegitimate because he didn’t win an election to his position — despite the fact that no federal judges are actually elected. Notably, although Trump and Republicans are now claiming that judicial orders against executive actions are illegitimate, they were celebratory when judges blocked orders issued by President Joe Biden over the past four years. While Musk complains about judges blocking his and DOGE’s work, U.S. voters are concerned with the department’s moves to slash federal agencies. A recent Economist /YouGov poll finds that a plurality of Americans (46 percent) believe that the DOGE cuts have “gone too far,” while only a quarter of respondents (25 percent) say they’ve been “about right.” Just 17 percent want the cuts to go even further. Respondents in the poll also want Musk to have less influence in the Trump administration, with only 15 percent saying they want the billionaire to be involved “a lot,” 27 percent saying they want Musk to influence things “a little,” and 47 percent saying they want him to have no influence at all.
The Social Security Administration will no longer allow phone verification, starting on March 31. On Tuesday, the Social Security Administration (SSA) introduced new measures aimed at curbing alleged fraud in the program — changes that will invariably make it harder for millions of Americans to apply for benefits or update their information, advocates for beneficiaries warn. Social Security recipients are allowed to confirm identifying information (used to make changes in benefits or to apply for the program itself) through multiple methods, including online, in-person at an SSA office or over the phone. But the new rule will eliminate the phone option , which is the preferred method for many who receive benefits, particularly those with disabilities and older individuals, who may be skeptical of sending information over the internet and unable to meet with someone in person. Acting SSA commissioner Leland Dudek lauded the new changes as making the program “identity-proof” when it comes to supposed fraud. “These changes are not intended to hurt our customers, but to make sure benefits go to the right customer at the right time,” he told reporters on a conference call . The changes are slated to go into effect on March 31 . Internal agency memos demonstrate SSA officials are well aware that the new measures will have a detrimental effect on tens of thousands of people each week , with the agency estimating that as many as 4.4 million recipients each year will need to visit an agency office. For many recipients, including the elderly and those with disabilities, that option is time consuming or geographically daunting — but failing to visit the office could result in the loss of their benefits. It’s also likely that there will be extreme backups in service for those who can make it to physical offices, as Elon Musk and his so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) are making huge cuts to the SSA, including reducing staffing levels and closing dozens of offices across the country . Critics of the cuts and the changes to the SSA have noted that these developments will cause real harm to beneficiaries. “By requiring seniors and disabled Americans to enroll online or in person at the same field offices they are trying to close, rather than over the phone, Trump and Musk are trying to create chaos and inefficiencies at SSA so they can privatize the system,” warned Rep. John Larson (D-Connecticut) , the ranking Democrat on the Social Security Subcommittee in Congress. The new standards for how people can change or apply for benefits “will drive people into overcrowded offices for no good reason. It is part of an ongoing effort, driven by Elon Musk’s DOGE, to cause Social Security to collapse,” the X account for Social Security Works, an advocacy group that aims to preserve and strengthen Social Security benefits, said in reaction to the changes . “This change will substantially delay access to their earned benefits,” said Kathleen Romig , director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “It will particularly burden seniors and people with disabilities who struggle with online services and people whose limited credit histories mean they cannot use commercial authentication tools.”
On an average day, 9,000 people may die due to the US’s aid cuts, a new estimate finds. The sweeping U.S. cuts to foreign aid are potentially killing thousands of people a day due to factors like starvation and disease, a new report finds — after “shadow president” Elon Musk has claimed that “no one” has died to the supposed “brief pause” on aid funding that the administration is seemingly seeking to make permanent . A report published on Saturday by The New York Times , citing estimates from the Center for Global Development , finds that the funding cuts will cause roughly 3 million people around the world to die within the next year. This includes over 1.6 million people who may die from the lack of HIV and AIDS prevention provided by the U.S.; nearly 550,000 who will die without food aid; and 1 million who would die without vaccines and prevention for tuberculosis and malaria. Most of these people live in countries where they have nowhere else to turn for aid, largely concentrated in countries in eastern and southern Africa which have been exploited by Western powers for hundreds of years. This means that, on an average day, roughly 9,000 people could die due to the lack of aid, the Center for Global Development found in its analysis. Some foreign donors could step in to fill the gap left by the U.S. funding, but the U.S. gives the most in foreign aid annually worldwide in total dollars, making it unlikely that all of the deficit could be covered, the group said. With the defunding of these programs, they found, it “appears inevitable” that “deaths will continue to climb because of the disorder and confusion within USAID and the number of service providers who have already been forced to close down.” When President Donald Trump took office, his administration announced that it would be carrying out a 90-day suspension of funding for foreign aid in order to supposedly “assess” their efficacy and “consistency with United States foreign policy.” As part of these cuts, Elon Musk led a charge to eradicate the U.S. Agency for International Development — an agency that, though often criticized for its role in upholding U.S. imperialism abroad, plays a major role in disease prevention and humanitarian programs around the world. Musk, who has been caught in numerous lies about his role in the Trump administration so far, said in a post on X earlier this month : “No one has died as a result of a brief pause to do a sanity check on foreign aid funding. No one.” But this isn’t true. First, it is misleading to call it a “brief pause,” as Trump has ordered the cancelation of 90 percent of U.S. foreign aid contracts, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying that the administration has already cancelled 83 percent of them. Even if the cuts were temporary, it would take time to reestablish programs that were gutted overnight . Second, even discounting the estimates of future deaths, countless people have already died due to the dismantling of foreign aid, as the Times has documented. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof said that, in fact, it took him less than an hour after traveling to south Sudan to find someone who had died as a result of the funding suspensions. This includes an orphan named Peter Donde, who had HIV transmitted from his mother during childbirth. His parents died of AIDS, but he was kept alive by medicine provided by U.S. aid, under a program known as President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. The 10-year-old child, no longer able to access his medicine, died shortly after the funding was suspended, as the Times found. An outreach provider who worked with the boy said he would be alive today if USAID had stayed. The World Health Organization said on Monday that the aid suspension could soon lead to lifesaving HIV treatment to be totally depleted in eight countries — Haiti, Kenya, Lesotho, South Sudan, Burkina Faso, Mali, Nigeria and Ukraine. “The disruptions to HIV programs could undo 20 years of progress” within a matter of months, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
A group of Democrats want an investigation into whether Musk has violated the criminal conflict of interest statute. The drum beat for a federal probe into whether billionaire and GOP donor Elon Musk violated conflict of interest law through his dealings with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is growing louder following reporting that technology from Musk’s Starlink, the satellite network developed by its company SpaceX, will be involved in upgrading the FAA air traffic control system. On Monday, a group of Democratic senators sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Acting Inspector General at the Transportation Department, Mitch Behm, demanding an investigation into whether Musk’s activities at the FAA have violated the criminal conflict of interest statute. The letter was first reported by The Guardian on Monday. “We are concerned that Musk… may be using his government role to benefit his own private company,” the senators wrote. The letter, sent by Sens. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) cites coverage from The Washington Post , which in late February reported that the FAA was considering canceling a $2.4 billion Verizon contract to upgrade the FAA’s communication system “that serves as the backbone of the nation’s air traffic control system” and award the work to Starlink, citing unnamed sources. The letter follows an ethics complaint, filed last week by the nonpartisan legal group Campaign Legal Center (CLC) to Behm, also asking for an investigation into whether the FAA’s business transactions with Starlink “are improper due to violations of the criminal conflict of interest law.” Both the letter from the Democratic senators and the CLC complaint cite a section of federal statute that prohibits government employees — including special government employees, which is Musk’s designation — from “participat personally and substantially” in any “particular matter” in which the employee, their spouse, their companies, or other business partners have any “financial interest.” “Public reports establish that the FAA began using Starlink services and considering contracts with the company in response to Musk’s requests,” according to the letter from CLC. “The public has a right to know that their tax dollars are being spent in the public’s best interest and not to benefit a government employee’s financial interests.” In early February , Musk — who has been deputized by U.S. President Trump to pursue cuts to government spending and personnel — said that his so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will “aim to make rapid safety upgrades to the air traffic control system.” According to Bloomberg, a SpaceX engineer arrived at the FAA headquarters in late February to “deliver what he described as a directive from his boss Elon Musk: The agency will immediately start work on a program to deploy thousands of the company’s Starlink satellite terminals to support the national airspace system.” “There is no effort or intent for Starlink to ‘take over’ any existing contract,” SpaceX wrote on X in early March. The company said it is working in coordination with another prime contractor for the FAA’s telecommunications infrastructure “to test the use of Starlink as one piece of the infrastructure upgrades so badly needed along with fiber, wireless, and other technologies.” Per Bloomberg , the FAA is already testing or actively using multiple Starlink terminals. The CLC letter argues that reporting provides evidence that “the FAA’s business relationship with Starlink is tainted by Musk’s influence. Musk is a government official with broad authority who acts with direct support from the president. With this authority and support, he has openly criticized the FAA’s contractors while directing the agency to test and use his company’s services.” This “establish a possible criminal conflict of interest violation, and an investigation is needed to determine whether the facts constitute a legal violation,” per the CLC letter. The requests to probe Musk’s business connections to the FAA come as the U.S. has dealt with a series of plane crashes and accidents, which in some cases have been deadly, and has invited scrutiny of the country’s air traffic control system. John P. Pelissero, the director of a government ethics program at Santa Clara University, told the Post that it appears that “because of Musk’s current position in DOGE and his closeness to Trump he and his company are getting an advantage and getting a contract,” speaking of the potential Verizon contract cancellation. “Who’s looking out for the public interest here when you get the person who’s cutting budgets and personnel from the FAA, suddenly trying to benefit from still another government contract?” Pelissero said, according to the Post.
Waleed Shahid described the senator’s vote for Trump’s spending bill as an “utterly embarrassing strategic blunder.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is facing mounting calls to step down after he voted in favor of the Republicans’ spending package Friday. The Republican bill has been described as a “blank check” for the White House to keep defunding and dismantling government services and agencies. Calls have been mounting for New York Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to primary Schumer, who was joined by eight other Democratic senators in voting for the bill. “This was one of the most utterly embarrassing strategic blunders on behalf of the Democrats that I’ve seen,” says Democratic strategist Waleed Shahid. He criticizes Schumer for “his surrender” to Trump and Elon Musk’s drastic defunding of the federal government after Schumer himself had warned against it. “You don’t say there’s a fire, and then you give the arsonist a match and gasoline. And that’s effectively what Chuck Schumer did.” This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . Senator Chuck Schumer is facing mounting calls to step down as the Democrats’ Senate leader after he voted in favor of a Republican spending package Friday which has been described as a “blank check” for the White House to keep defunding and dismantling government agencies and services. Groups including Indivisible and Pass the Torch have since called for Schumer to step aside. On Friday, 11 young activists with Sunrise Movement were arrested at Schumer’s D.C. office as they urged him not to, quote, “compromise on our lives and futures” ahead of the vote. The other Democratic senators who voted with Schumer to avert a government shutdown were Catherine Cortez Masto, Dick Durbin, John Fetterman, Kirsten Gillibrand, Maggie Hassan, Gary Peters, Brian Schatz, Jeanne Shaheen and independent Senator Angus King. This is Senator Schumer. MINORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER: Mr. President, I believe it is my job to make the best choice for the country to minimize the harms to the American people. Therefore, I will vote to keep the government open and not shut it down. AMY GOODMAN: We’re joined right now by Waleed Shahid. He is a Democratic strategist whose new piece on Substack is headlined “Schumer Says Trump Is An Existential Threat — Then Surrenders Anyway.” Waleed was previously the spokesperson for Justice Democrats and former senior adviser for the campaigns of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman. Welcome back to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us. Why don’t you respond to what Schumer did? WALEED SHAHID: I think I’ve been involved in politics for about a decade, and this was one of the most utterly embarrassing strategic blunders on behalf of the Democrats that I’ve seen. Chuck Schumer — it would be one thing if House Democrats weren’t going to fight, but they had House Democrats in vulnerable swing districts who took hard votes that they’re going to have to answer for their constituents on, and then Schumer led them — led them in a direction as if he was going to hold up the vote on this, and then surrendered at the last minute. And I think that, you know, they’ve spent — the Democrats and Chuck Schumer have spent a year warning the American people about Project 2025, warning people that democracy would be under existential threat under Donald Trump. And now with Elon Musk controlling DOGE, what they’re doing is Project 2025 on steroids. So, you don’t say there’s a fire, and then you give the arsonist a match and gasoline. And that’s effectively what Chuck Schumer did. It’s like if Democrats were rowing a boat, and they had one person rowing on the left side, and then the person on the right side just stopped rowing, and then they wonder why they’re not moving or they’re staying still. This is — AMY GOODMAN: Or they’re going in circles. WALEED SHAHID: Or they’re going in circles. And this is just one of the things that, you know, people are really angry. And I think, more than ever, we need ordinary citizens, ordinary Americans, involved in our politics, involved — engaged in politics, because the Democratic leadership, it is clear, they are not going to stand up and fight against Trump and Musk in the way that grassroots Democrats want them to. I think what Chuck Schumer did, I have few words for it. AMY GOODMAN: I mean, if he had signaled he was going to do that all along, that would be different. You would just differ with him supporting it, right? WALEED SHAHID: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: But it was that he suggested he was going to vote against this. What did he say in a New York Times op-ed ? He called Republicans “a crowd of Trump sycophants and MAGA radicals who seem to want to burn everything to the ground,” and accused Trump of wanting “full control over government spending.” Yet, by supporting the Republican bill, wasn’t he giving that power to Trump and Musk now? WALEED SHAHID: Yeah, it makes no sense. They had a chance — Democrats had a chance to tell the nation that the Republicans and Donald Trump were shutting down the government in order to protect Elon Musk, one of the wealthiest men in the world. That could have been the message over the next few weeks. And instead, they folded and let the flooding the zone and the chaos continue. Schumer went in the Times and gave what I thought was a totally nonsensical interview, where he said our goal is to make the Republicans unpopular so that the fever breaks, that if we can get Republican — if we can get Trump’s approval down under 40%, then soon Republicans will come to the table and negotiate with Democrats. And Schumer cited 2005 and 2017 as examples of that. We are not in 2005 or 2017. We are in the era of Project 2025, run by Elon Musk. And I don’t think Schumer — politics is about knowing what time it is, and I, frankly, don’t think that Schumer knows what time it is. AMY GOODMAN: I want to ask you about calls mounting for New York Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to challenge Schumer in his next primary election. She spoke on CNN about why she opposed the spending bill. REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: This turns the federal government into a slush fund for Donald Trump and Elon Musk. It sacrifices congressional authority, and it is deeply partisan. And so, to me, it is almost unthinkable why Senate Democrats would vote to hand the few pieces of leverage that we have away for free, when we’ve been sent here to protect Social Security, protect Medicaid and protect Medicare. AMY GOODMAN: Do you think Congressmember AOC should challenge Schumer? WALEED SHAHID: I think someone should. You know, that’s her decision to make. But he’s not up for primary until 2028, so we have a lot of work to do between now and 2028 to make that happen. My thing is, the main thing we need is constituents in states like New York, constituents in all the places where the senators voted with Republicans on this continuing resolution — AMY GOODMAN: Both New York senators did, Gillibrand and Schumer. WALEED SHAHID: Gillibrand also. We need people to stand up, go to their offices, make calls. You can join a group like Indivisible, MoveOn, Working Families Party, the DSA. There are many groups getting involved. And I think that Democratic leaders need to hear way more from their constituents. They snatched the ball from grassroots Democrats on this. Grassroots Democrats were ready to make a play here, ready to march in one direction. And Hakeem Jeffries had the House unified around something, and then Chuck Schumer divided Democrats, and now we’re spending today, all over the news, talking about Chuck Schumer’s surrender, his blunder, instead of talking about what Elon Musk is doing to the government. AMY GOODMAN: So, in this last minute, what can ordinary people do who aren’t congressmembers, who aren’t senators? What difference does it make what actions people take? WALEED SHAHID: I think senators and members of Congress need to hear way more from their constituents about the dangers of what it means for Senate Democrats to give up on this. People should be calling their senators, their members of Congress. People should be showing up to their office. They can go to websites like Indivisible.org . They can join their local Working Families Party or DSA chapter. They can nominate a candidate through Justice Democrats. But the number one thing that I think people need to do is call their member of Congress and tell them that they don’t think Chuck Schumer is up to the job, and they’re angry at what his decision was to sell out grassroots Democrats in order to fund and support the Trump government, which they’ve warned us is an existential crisis to our country. AMY GOODMAN: And Schumer’s fear that it would be called the Schumer shutdown and that a shutdown could even give more power to the executive? WALEED SHAHID: I was so — I was so surprised that the federal union representing federal workers said that they were against Schumer’s decision on this. These unions don’t take these decisions lightly. And so, when the union representing federal workers are saying, “You need — we are already experiencing a government shutdown, and we need you to fight.” AMY GOODMAN: We want to thank you, Waleed Shahid, for joining us. We’ll link your new article , “Schumer Says Trump Is An Existential Threat — Then Surrenders Anyway.” That does it for our show. I’m Amy Goodman. Thanks for joining us.
It’s not hard to imagine Democrats who didn’t hold the line for Medicaid won’t hold it for trans health care, either. Ten Senate Democrats handed Republicans a critical victory , voting in favor of cloture on a budget that will allow the Trump Administration to continue wielding budget cuts as a political weapon — targeting the administration’s opponents, including trans and queer people. The budget slashes Medicaid, dealing a direct blow to vulnerable constituents, while further entrenching the administration’s consolidation of power. The backlash from within the party was swift, with figures ranging from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Nancy Pelosi condemning those who crossed the aisle. Yet some have rushed to defend the vote, insisting that Democrats had no real choice — that avoiding a government shutdown was the priority, and that Republicans are the true villains here. But this defense falls apart under scrutiny. Would these same voices excuse a vote that greenlit anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-trans amendments, restrictions on mifepristone, or even a total abortion ban? Where, exactly, is the line? Call each of these Senators to NOT vote with the GOP & instead grow a spine. Each number starts with 202-224 Schumer – 6542 Hassan – 3324 Peters – 6221 Durbin – 2152 Schatz – 3934 King – 5344 Shaheen – 2841 Fetterman – 4254 Cortez Masto – 3542 Gillibrand – 4451 — Qasim Rashid, Esq. ( @qasimrashid.com ) March 13, 2025 at 11:34 PM Call each of these Senators to NOT vote with the GOP & instead grow a spine. Each number starts with 202-224 Schumer – 6542 Hassan – 3324 Peters – 6221 Durbin – 2152 Schatz – 3934 King – 5344 Shaheen – 2841 Fetterman – 4254 Cortez Masto – 3542 Gillibrand – 4451 In recent months, fear of Republican hostage-taking has driven a wave of capitulation, with institutions and individuals alike complying with administration policies — even when those policies are blocked in court. Nowhere is this more evident than in what the transgender community has endured. Hospital systems have abandoned gender-affirming care , citing the risk to their government grants, their fear of Trump’s administration outweighing their willingness to fight. Even LGBTQ+ health centers have erased gender-affirming care resources , afraid that merely acknowledging such care could jeopardize their federally qualified health center status. Again and again, we see the same pattern: compliance disguised as pragmatism, retreat framed as strategy. And to those who justify it, the question remains — where is your line? When a handful of Democrats voted to advance the Republican budget, they justified it by claiming the alternative — a government shutdown — was too steep a price to pay. But in the chaos of the Trump administration, that claim doesn’t hold up. Markets are already crumbling, Elon Musk is slashing essential programs with no oversight, and dysfunction defines the federal government. Even if Republicans tried to pin the shutdown on Democrats, the messaging writes itself: We will not vote for a budget that gives Elon Musk the power to act as an unelected king, nor will we allow Medicaid to be gutted. But they didn’t even try. Instead, they retreated — the one time they had real power, real leverage, and a chance to push back. Apparently, Medicaid and Musk were not their line. As expected, a small but influential chorus of pundits is rushing to excuse the Democrats who voted to advance the Republican budget, arguing that criticism should be directed solely at the GOP. On the surface, the logic seems sound — after all, far more Republicans than Democrats supported the bill. But this framing ignores a critical fact: had Democrats held the line as a unified caucus, the bill would not have passed. Had leadership actually whipped the votes, the bill would not have passed. Republicans absolutely deserve blame, and readers of my newsletter know I don’t hesitate to call them out. But the getaway driver is just as culpable. We expect Democrats to champion those in need, to fight against Musk and Trump’s creeping despotism, and — at the bare minimum — to have a line they will not cross. If protecting Medicaid and democracy isn’t their line, what does that mean for the issue I have dedicated my life to — reporting on efforts to protect LGBTQ+ people? If faced with a budget that guts transgender healthcare, bans gender-affirming care for youth, and strips funding from any organization or study that even mentions transgender people, would these same Democrats not offer the same excuse? What happens when the next budget includes any of the 50 anti-LGBTQ+ poison pill riders that have surfaced in past proposals, and that will almost certainly return? What does this precedent mean for any marginalized community that can be targeted the same way? It’s not hard to imagine a world where Democrats who didn’t hold the line for Medicaid won’t hold it for trans healthcare either. Let’s be honest: if it’s our rights on the chopping block in a government shutdown fight, they won’t fight for us, and that has been made clear. We don’t have to imagine this scenario — it has already happened. Just months ago, Democrats passed the National Defense Authorization Act with a provision banning Tricare from covering transgender troops’ surgeries, as well as blocking gender-affirming care for the children of service members. While I reported extensively on it, many remained silent. Democratic leadership — the same leadership that just voted to advance this budget — refused to even allow their own senators to vote on an amendment stripping out the anti-trans provisions. For those defending the actions of the ten overtly complicit Democrats, where is your line? Would you offer the same justifications if ten Democrats voted for a total abortion ban, insisting well, we had to keep the government open ? What about a bill defunding public schools? A ban on clean energy? Take the issue you care about most, push it to its furthest extreme — because everyone has a line. Or maybe not. Maybe the real fear among those making excuses isn’t about Republican atrocities at all. Maybe it’s the uncomfortable truth that we have work to do in our own party.

Mark Zuckerberg’s decision may have potentially devastating consequences for the safety of marginalized communities. When Mark Zuckerberg terminated Meta’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs for hiring and training employees and procuring suppliers in January 2025, he forged “ inroads with the incoming Trump administration,” abandoned Meta’s founding ethos of open innovation, and dramatically realigned how the tech giant will now do business, as critics like Bärí A. Williams , former lead counsel for Meta (then Facebook) and creator of its now-dissolved Supplier Diversity program, noted. Zuckerberg’s changes play right into the ultra-conservative presidential handbook, Project 2025, with potentially devastating consequences for the safety of numerous marginalized communities. The supplier diversity program was meant to accomplish multiple goals, including creating economic opportunities for marginalized communities and mitigating gentrification caused by Facebook’s expanding headquarters into East Palo Alto’s Black and brown communities. However, by incentivizing its employees with $10,000 bonuses to move into East Palo Alto, Facebook increased traffic congestion and disproportionately drove up rents in the area. As a result, many of the city’s historic, working-class population faced evictions and other forced move-outs . Then, in only a matter of weeks, Meta dismantled Facebook DEI programs that had taken years to build. Zuckerberg, of course, has the prerogative to change his company’s course. However, politically motivated decisions are often made during national swings of the partisan pendulum. In the inevitable event that the pendulum swings back in the opposite direction, Meta will find that its scrapped programs will be hard to recover. “The trust of users, employees, and suppliers has been destroyed,” said Williams . Mirroring Meta’s change in corporate policies, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative announced that they are ending both internal and external DEI efforts, work on immigration reform, and racial equity grantmaking, citing the “shifting regulatory and legal landscape.” In a recent survey , many leaders in corporate philanthropy indicated that they plan to reduce emphasis on racial equality (24 percent) and gender equality (22 percent) efforts in response to the trend, reflecting “a broader recalibration of corporate diversity strategies amid heightened scrutiny and pushback” that is being driven by “political polarization, legislative actions targeting diversity programs and race- or gender-specific philanthropic efforts, and intensifying stakeholder debates over the role of corporations in addressing social issues.” The FCC Goes Full MAGA Accusations from conservatives that their online content had been unfairly targeted for political reasons presumably factored into Zuckerberg’s decision to do away with fact-checking and other changes to Meta’s approach to content moderation. Studies have shown , however, that although posts by conservatives had, indeed, been taken down more frequently, this was not due to political beliefs. Rather, take-downs were spurred by the promotion of false claims, sharing of links to low-quality news sources, and the posting of hateful speech and imagery that violated community standards. FCC Commissioner and Trump’s chief censor, Brendan Carr, the author of Project 2025’s chapter on the FCC, would have the public believe that social media moderation practices infringe on First Amendment rights, as he asserted in a November 2024 letter to the Big Tech companies. Unless the government was explicitly involved in those takedowns, however, the decisions of private corporations have no First Amendment implications. Meta’s overhaul of its fact-checking, content moderation, and DEI policies appears to have been motivated by the desire to proactively align itself with Trump administration ideology. Former Facebook employees who served on Meta’s DEI and trust and safety teams say this shift was “a long time in the making.” In 2024, for example, Sheryl Sandberg stepped down from Meta’s board of directors , to be replaced by the CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship organization, Dana White, “who leads the MAGA movements’ ultra-masculine sports league,” illustrating one of the steps that led to Meta’s current right turn. In May 2024, Meta hired Dustin Carmack , former Heritage Foundation fellow and author of Project 2025 ’s Intelligence Community chapter, to assist with the development of Meta’s new approach to content moderation across all of its platforms, effectively intertwining Project 2025’s governmental priorities with Meta’s corporate policies and goals. Carr’s letter to Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai of Alphabet (which owns Google), Tim Cook of Apple, and Satya Nandella of Microsoft (but not Musk) referred to them and their fact-checking, content moderation, and DEI practices as a “censorship cartel” that infringes on Americans’ right to free speech. In February 2025, Carr also issued a letter to Comcast, accusing the corporation of using DEI initiatives to impose discrimination (ostensibly against White people). Trump Delivers on Project 2025 The Global Project for Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) has warned that Meta’s new policies “align directly with Project 2025’s blueprint for dismantling” what Project 2025 identifies as “government censorship infrastructure.” Project 2025 perpetuates a manufactured moral panic around the assertion — unsupported by evidence — that “anti-white racism” is among the biggest threats to civil rights. The right-wing presidential playbook promotes White Christian Nationalism and involves plans to end the use of terms that allegedly “deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights,” including language for gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, and reproductive rights, GPAHE reported. Even though Trump said throughout the campaign season that he knew nothing about Project 2025, on January 20, 2025, he signed an executive gender order declaring there are only two sexes — defined biologically as male and female, following Project 2025’s plans to end the “DEI apparatus.” The executive order requires the federal government to use the term “sex” instead of “gender,” and will be reflected in all government-issued identification and other federal documents. The White House has also issued a ban on the use of pronouns in federal employees’ email signatures and on team communication platforms like Slack. In response to guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) ordered researchers and scientists to pause or remove the publication of research with any of the following forbidden terms, “gender, transgender, pregnant person, pregnant people, LGBT, transsexual, non-binary, nonbinary, assigned male at birth, assigned female at birth, biologically male, biologically female,” creating challenges to “publish research on diseases that disproportionately impact groups who can no longer be named.” Macho Fashions for the Autocrats Trump’s gender order coincides with Silicon Valley’s “ macho makeover ,” with Zuckerberg and his tech bros Musk and Bezos “dressing like titans, strongmen, and emperors.” As Zuckerberg told podcaster Joe Rogan, “A culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits,” provoking accusations of toxic masculinity . Typically understood to encompass how men are “culturally trained and socially pressured to behave,” toxic masculinity is typically characterized by toughness, anti-femininity, and power. Zuckerberg’s endorsement of aggression “sends an even stronger message that women aren’t welcome,” wrote Ashley Morgan, a masculinities scholar at Cardiff Metropolitan University. The same point holds for nonbinary individuals, who might well wonder where they fit into Zuckerberg’s hypermasculine worldview. The technogarchy “have long been aligning themselves with mythmaking, macho masculinity narratives,” and their new fashion aesthetic is not simply a trend, reported Amy Francombe, but a warning of “the consolidation of power in the tech industry” and its increased collaboration with the US government. “Zuckerberg’s style shift says something about a specific group of American billionaires who are aligning themselves with what looks to be a new political order within the United States,” Benjamin Wild of the Manchester Fashion Institute told Wired . In Trump’s second reign — indeed, Trump fancies himself a king — replete with displays of strong-man entitlement, wealth, and misogyny, the masculinization of Big Tech also signals a normalization of patriarchal power ; that is, men’s power over and exclusion of women and gender nonconforming persons throughout sociopolitical and economic systems built by men. Wild described “parallels with medieval royal courts, where members of the aristocracy competed among themselves, often in what they wore and how they consumed, for the attention and patronage of the ruler.” Policies for Safety Obliterated The purpose of hate speech policies is to keep all users safe, not to “put a target on the backs of one historically marginalized group,” said Jenni Olson, Senior Director of the Social Media Safety program at GLAAD. According to 404 Media interviews with five current Meta employees, many employees are furious over the company’s content moderation changes that now allow users on its platforms to say that LGBTQ people are “abnormal” and “mentally ill.” This, explained Olson , is anti-LGBTQ dog whistle language. Meta’s extreme-right posturing mirrors the deluge of anti-trans and anti-DEI efforts emanating from the Trump White House, and the new policies and changes “send a clear message that the tech giant and its leadership may actually hold (and espouse) bigoted, homophobic, and transphobic beliefs about LGBTQ people,” Olson warned. Proponents of the DOGE takedown of DEI espouse a return to an allegedly merit-based society, but they ignore the fact that permitting, or even encouraging, hateful rhetoric on social media platforms can increase the likelihood of real world consequences, including threats and physical violence against members of marginalized communities. Meta may argue that the hateful rhetoric online doesn’t meet the criteria for hate speech established in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969). Still, continual exposure to hateful ideas and language has been shown to result in acts of “stochastic terrorism,” the term used by scholars and law enforcement to describe how “ideologically driven hate speech increases the likelihood that people will violently and unpredictably attack the targets of vicious claims.” Although stochastic terrorism is statistically predictable, when such acts of violence will occur and who will carry them out are not. For example, social media accounts such as Libs of TikTok and others spread virulent messages about the LGBTQ community that have led to bomb threats against Planet Fitness, public schools, libraries, and the firebombing of a progressive church in Plano, Texas. Banned Education, Manufactured Ignorance The United States population is widely uneducated when it comes to LGBTQ culture, history, rights, and issues, particularly with regard to the transgender community. Either because LGBTQ subject matter is not taught, or is banned outright, in US classrooms, the formation of opinions on the LGBTQ community is disproportionately shaped by transphobic content on social media . A void of factual information about the transgender community will likely be exacerbated by Meta’s changes, which will promote increased circulation of disinformation and misinformation on its platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The trajectory of hate speech on X, after it was acquired by Musk and remodeled to reflect his distorted conception of “free speech,” provides a cautionary example. As with X, Meta’s new policies will promote astounding increases in racist, homophobic, Islamophobic, antisemitic, and misogynistic speech on Meta platforms. Pushback and Boycotts Although the number of companies abandoning DEI policies is growing, according to Fortune reporter Alena Botros, some prominent corporations, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase , Costco, Salesforce, Apple, and Microsoft, are maintaining their diversity policies. Even the NFL has doubled-down on its commitment to DEI. And some employees at Meta are subtly pushing back “against their billionaire Big Tech boss,” Botros reported, by undertaking actions such as bringing tampons into the men’s restrooms at Meta. Similarly, a movement is forming that encourages Tesla owners to get rid of their vehicles in protest of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and “ the wholesale incursions into government systems” by its de facto leader, Elon Musk. For example, singer Sheryl Crow got rid of her Tesla and donated the money to NPR, the public radio outlet that, Crow posted on X, is under threat by the Trump Administration. As per Project 2025’s promises and Trump’s executive order, PBS has shuttered its DEI office; and although NPR has a dedicated DEI office too, it has not yet announced its plans. PBS and NPR haven’t escaped Carr’s letters — the one to them claims that the public media outlets were in violation of their noncommercial status by publicizing their sponsors. On February 19, 2025, Pew Research published findings from a survey of Americans’ opinions of Musk and Zuckerberg. The gist is that more Republicans view Musk favorably than Democrats; and views of Zuckerberg are mostly unfavorable among both parties. Polls from the first months of 2025 show that Trump’s approval ratings are slipping, mainly owing to his overreach of executive power. With consumer confidence plunging , some Trump supporters may be regretting their choice. These findings may align with Bärí Williams’s advice “not to reward Meta with our engagement, our data, or their ability to earn ad revenue from us.” Invoking the history of the Civil Rights Movement, in which DEI has its roots, Williams described how boycotts were used to create safe spaces and entrepreneurial opportunities for marginalized communities. In her view, disengagement from Meta is the only way that Meta will feel the full consequences of the decision to abandon diversity. Author Caroline Sumlin wrote that, thanks to the earlier generation of civil rights activists who pressed on in the face of adversity, we should do the same now — not only for the present day but for future generations. The dismantling of DEI practices, fact-checking, and loosening of content moderation around hateful speech is in direct conflict with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights . Having pledged support for these principles, Meta continues to be responsible for respecting and protecting fundamental human rights even if doing so is not required by national law. Meta’s policy changes infringe on the human rights of others by actively encouraging discrimination across their platforms, refusing to address human rights linked to misinformation , and using “free speech” as rationale for human rights abuses. When a handful of major tech companies have a monopoly on the information space , they can effectively control the content we consume, make top-down determinations about what is deemed morally acceptable or historically accurate, and decide what information and viewpoints to preserve, omit, or alter. This can lead to a version of reality that reflects and promotes narrow corporate interests at the expense of the public good. To counter the twin threats of online hate speech and historical revisionism, users of these services should: develop an understanding of how information can be curated online through the use of algorithms that favor certain viewpoints over others; actively seek out information from a range of sources such as independent news, local media, and international outlets; and push for stronger regulations to ensure transparency and accountability in the digital space.
Three private equity veterans are weaseling their way in, reportedly on the orders of the presumptive SSA commissioner. The Social Security Administration (SSA), an irreplaceable lifeline for 73 million people, is only the latest venerable U.S. institution to be hit with a campaign of media falsehoods and startling internal sabotage efforts, all on the orders of Trump and the reactionary right. This has taken its most visibly outrageous form in the bureaucratic pillaging committed by Elon Musk’s self-proclaimed “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), the widely loathed advisory body with a meme-derived name as juvenile as its staffers . But this week, a still-more ominous threat appears to be circling. Bloomberg reports that three individuals representing private equity concerns — firms in an insidious financial industry intent on harvesting anything that can rake in a profit for the ultrarich — have now shown up, alongside DOGE, to meddle in the life-sustaining work of the SSA. This should be of grave concern to all, but the public at large is not widely aware of these threats. Private equity is just that: private, and opaque by design. These firms’ grotesque amassment of wealth has enabled them to cannibalize huge reaches of the economy; estimates vary, but the industry’s combined assets run, at minimum, into the several trillions. Predatory firms have made startling headway at acquiring, exploiting and flipping companies “across every imaginable sector, from housing and hospitals , to fossil fuels and retail , to pet shops and music catalogs ,” as Derek Seidman writes for Truthout . “Private equity has a reputation for being perhaps the most ruthless arm of Wall Street.” Most infamous are its firms’ parasitic takeovers: buying out a corporation, saddling it with debt to enrich themselves, then brutally cutting costs, often starting by firing many workers and squeezing the rest for every cent and second. Eventually, they strip the whole thing to a husk and sell off whatever assets remain. Despite the astonishing extent of private equity’s incursions into civil society, our sense of the scale, and the damage involved , has lagged behind this industry’s aggressive pace. And now, private equity’s sights are turning to the Social Security Administration. Privatization of the retirement market has been a long-standing goal of capital. If the SSA really were dismantled, a vast retirement market — over a trillion dollars — would open up, into which could be shoved all sorts of new corporate profit models and plans. Yet the social results, at least for those who aren’t wealthy investors, are easy to imagine if you’ve had the essential U.S. experience of grappling with health insurance. There would be the familiar labyrinths of complexity, deception and usurious charges — but the harms inflicted could easily multiply, as the market for retirement programs is, of course, retirees: older people, disabled people and those in deepest need. Privatization for profit would target the savings and last hopes of all these communities. Social Security, everyone likes to say, is the political “third rail.” Millions depend on it, and so targeting it is career-ending, according to conventional wisdom. Unfortunately, upending conventional wisdom and conventional decency alike come naturally to the current president and his allies, and they have a particular talent for goading people to vote against their own interests. This Trump administration’s increasingly brazen seizures of power, civil rights violations and sprees of civic destruction have been streaming forth at what has felt like an impossible rate. The SSA was more or less raided; it was an invasion of the self-appointed “fraud investigators” of DOGE. Turmoil followed. Already understaffed and overworked , the SSA has now been beset by mass firings, funding cuts and the invasive and capricious changes dictated by DOGE. Meanwhile, a media smear campaign against SSA has been taken up eagerly by the president himself, aided by unctuous crony Musk. Despite promising that SSA won’t be cut, Trump has declared the Social Security Administration riddled with fraud . Musk, too, has touted several falsehoods , including that the SSA is essentially “a Ponzi scheme,” in need of rescue from the world’s richest government handout recipient . Bloomberg reports that three individuals representing private equity concerns have now shown up, alongside DOGE, to meddle in the life-sustaining work of the SSA. The frontline work of Musk’s DOGE is to press for ways to tear apart public systems from within their own offices. At the SSA, DOGE, trying to get in through a side door of sorts, found an ally in a mid-level anti-fraud manager, Leland Dudek, who corresponded with them officially — an inappropriate assumption of authority that won Dudek an investigation and administrative leave . However, soon after that, the acting interim commissioner, Michelle King, refused to disseminate citizen data to DOGE and resigned . Then Dudek would experience quite the reversal of fortune. To reward his unthinking loyalty, Trump named the bumbling Dudek the interim head of the entire Social Security Administration. In turn, under Dudek’s watch, DOGE has been entrusted, inexplicably, with some extremely valuable data. Nancy Altman, a policy and legal expert and president of the major SSA advocacy nonprofit Social Security Works, spoke with Truthout and shared her expert insights into what she feels are some extraordinary and outrageous developments. DOGE, Altman said, demanded “total access to everything, including the source codes.” The SSA’s collaborating experts had never been granted “the kind of access wanted.” SSA data, she explained, is very securely protected — it contains the Social Security numbers, identities, financial and personal information, immigration status, etc. for 70 million people. It is the ultimate scammer’s treasure trove. Yet DOGE staffers insisted on being allowed to freely view and copy this data and take it off-site. The neophytes of the “anti-fraud” task force have quickly become the most likely vectors of SSA data theft, scams and fraud. And they’ve now had every chance to tamper with or copy data themselves. DOGE can certainly report that it has successfully “disrupted” the SSA. According to a transcript of sworn testimony by a 30-year veteran who was forced out, DOGE’s ignorance about the most basic functions of the SSA was immediately apparent. After the first culling of senior leaders (who took with them “literally … a thousand years of collective leadership and knowledge,” Altman said with chagrin), the understaffed SSA now intends to fire another 7,000 of its 57,000 workers — as the thinning workforce reached a 50-year low . DOGE staffers “created complete chaos,” Altman said. “In the guise of efficiency, they’ve created so much inefficiency. They got rid of probationary workers who had just been trained for 11 and a half months.… They’ve been closing field offices, they’ve been getting rid of regional offices.” “People are out of a job — goodbye, you’re gone — and told they were fired for performance, which is a lie,” she went on. “But keeps from being able to get employment insurance.” Since the mass firings, the arms of the SSA that now answer to the Trump administration’s whims have helped the president explore even lower lows of cruelty and pettiness — though, at least in these two cases, they immediately backtracked when challenged. The presumptive incoming SSA commissioner, pending Senate confirmation, is Frank Bisignano, on whose appointment Truthout previously reported . He is known as a Wall Street “fixer” — a cost-cutter, profit-booster and workforce-slimmer. His inexperience in the field, his pugnacious style and his billion dollars made him a baffling pick, unless slashing everything is the goal. It seems that the SSA is receiving unsolicited help from quite a few such “fixers,” who are so intent on “fixing” things that are not broken. Dudek will remain a largely disempowered figurehead until Bisignano’s appointment. Then, during his tenure, Bisignano may well usher in private equity in full force. Altman also said she knows him to be receptive to dubious ongoing proposals to replace workers with AI chatbots — another looming threat to SSA employees, many of whom staff roles that are premised on the nuanced use of human communication and understanding, claims adjusters chief among them. Again, per Bloomberg , private equity has just gained a “beachhead” in the SSA. An infiltrating “team of veterans” — for now, limited to Antonio Gracias, founder of Valor Equity Partners; Scott Coulter, formerly of Lone Pine Capital; and Michael Russo, formerly of Shift4 — will execute their mission. Russo has stepped right up into the role of agency chief information officer. According to Altman, Russo is operating on the direct orders of Bisignano. Apart from that, it’s not yet clear what the trio’s full roles will entail — but it’s certainly worth noting that Gracias was an early investor and close collaborator in Tesla and SpaceX, as well as a private equity resource whom Musk has called upon : another “fixer.” These firms’ grotesque amassment of wealth has enabled them to cannibalize huge reaches of the economy. Altman, citing knowledge of the matter, remarked that Bisignano may be jumping the gun more than a little when it comes to giving orders in advance of his prospective appointment. She said Dudek has admitted as much in a private meeting: He takes all his marching orders from the not-yet-commissioner. As Altman said, “They’re trying to make it look like got clean hands, but he’s conferring with the acting commissioner five times a day.… the guy calling the shots.” A commendable start to a new job: sent in a goon squad to ransack his own agency, then hid from responsibility — a “fixer” indeed. Private equity, in addition to swallowing up and digesting the aforementioned family homes , hospitals , daycares, beloved publications and cultural institutions, and plenty more of the decent things in life — is, of course, just as happy to profit from the nefarious ones too. The industry invests heavily in private prisons, prison services and police ( including Atlanta’s Cop City ), alongside defense, oil and gas, and other extractive and exploitative systems. Private equity firms are certainly not above finding ways to help themselves to the public coffers, either: siphoning profit, to give just one quite recent example, from affordable housing assistance funds. It’s not for nothing that the private equity acquisitions are often considered hostile takeovers. One example ( also noted by Derek Seidman in Truthout ), is the infamous dissection of Toys “R” Us by top firms KKR and Bain Capital . A rapacious and ethics-optional seeker of profit above all, private equity can seem like one of the purest distillations of the inhumane logic of capital. Right now, sensing favorable conditions , private equity interests are making plans to further enter 401(k)s and get into defined contribution pension plans. “How can we not give investors more access to that asset class?” one CEO mused aloud at a conference. That arrangement has already been a disaster for retirement — many public pension funds were pressed to bet on risky assets and lost. But the firms collect their massive fees either way. To capital, perhaps Social Security appears like nothing but wastefulness, wasted opportunity. In truth it’s not wasteful — far from it. In fact, Altman noted, not only is real fraud so rare as to be totally negligible (0.00002 percent), the SSA is also exceptional in that “less than a penny of every dollar spent is spent on administration. You can’t find that level of efficiency in the private sector.” In the U.S., facing a retirement without Social Security would resemble the experience of our current health insurance system: paying top dollar for inferior outcomes, all while contesting with frustrating, indifferent or outright malicious corporations. We’ve seen what vulture capitalists have done to hospice , retail, medicine and nursing homes — in the latter, brutal cost-cutting under private equity ownership has resulted in 20,000 premature deaths . Figures like this — which would ultimately be far, far more numerous if Social Security were lost, to say nothing of the poverty and homelessness that would ensue — help drive home the true stakes of this struggle. Our present condition is one of class warfare — as unsubtly literalized by the pawns of billionaires, swarming the major bulwark of U.S. social welfare. “These people are really destroying everything that’s been built — that is there to support all of us.… This is the reason we have a government,” Altman said. “It’s time for the pendulum to swing back.”
A planned reduction of 10,000 workers stoked fears that the US Postal Service is on a path toward privatization. U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy’s Thursday announcement that the independent United States Postal Service is partnering with the Department of Government Efficiency on a cost-cutting crusade that includes a planned reduction of 10,000 workers stoked fears that one of America’s most trusted and relied-upon federal agencies is on a path toward privatization. In a letter to congressional leaders, DeJoy said DOGE will help the USPS “in identifying and achieving further efficiencies.” The postal chief listed “mismanagement” of the agency’s retirement assets and workers’ compensation program, “unfunded mandates imposed on us by legislation,” and “burdensome regulatory requirements restricting normal business practice” as issues to be addressed. Scoop: Postmaster General Louis DeJoy agreed last nigh to collaborate with DOGE “to assist us in identifying and achieving further efficiencies.” Follows Monday meeting at USPS headquarters between DOGE & DeJoy. We’ve reported Trump considering privatizing USPS or merging with Commerce Dept. — Jacob Bogage ( @jacobbogage.bsky.social ) March 13, 2025 at 1:59 PM Scoop: Postmaster General Louis DeJoy agreed last nigh to collaborate with DOGE “to assist us in identifying and achieving further efficiencies.” Follows Monday meeting at USPS headquarters between DOGE & DeJoy. We’ve reported Trump considering privatizing USPS or merging with Commerce Dept. “The letter suggests alarming actions for DOGE to pursue that would easily lead to the privatization and politicization of the Postal Service,” Democrats on the U.S. House Oversight Committee said in response to the announcement. “This includes DeJoy’s call to gut or even terminate the Postal Regulatory Commission, the independent regulator of the Postal Service created by Congress and responsible for approving rate changes and ensuring appropriate service.” Brian Renfroe, president of the nearly 300,000-member National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC), said Thursday that while “policy changes are needed to improve the Postal Service’s financial viability… misguided ideas like privatization” are not the answer. “Commonsense solutions are what the Postal Service needs, not privatization efforts that will threaten 640,000 postal employees’ jobs, 7.9 million jobs tied to our work, and the universal service every American relies on daily,” Renfroe added. DeJoy — who last month announced his intent to step down after more than four years in office — has led a dramatic restructuring of the USPS, a constitutionally sanctioned agency. His tenure has been marred by allegations of criminal election obstruction , conflicts of interest , and other corruption . Critics have also warned that DeJoy’s Delivering for America , a 10-year austerity plan , put the agency on a fast track toward slower service, job cuts, and, ultimately, privatization. U.S. President Donald Trump has acknowledged that his administration is revisiting plans to possibly privatize the Postal Service — a policy recommended by the Office of Management and Budget during his first term. Last month, The Washington Post reported that Trump planned to fire the entire Postal Board of Governors and bring the independent USPS under control of the Department of Commerce, a move experts argue would likely be illegal. Elon Musk , the de facto head of DOGE, said earlier this month that the USPS and Amtrak, the national passenger rail service, should be privatized. DOGE’s short but staggering track record of eviscerating federal agencies by dubiously firing tens of thousands of workers — a policy a federal judge found illegal on Thursday — is deeply concerning to many defenders of the Postal Service. “The only thing worse for the Postal Service than DeJoy’s Delivering for America plan is turning the service over to Elon Musk and DOGE so they can undermine it, privatize it, and then profit off Americans’ loss,” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, said Thursday. “This capitulation will have catastrophic consequences for all Americans — especially those in rural and hard-to-reach areas — who rely on the Postal Service every day to deliver mail, medications, ballots, and more,” the congressman added. “Reliable mail delivery can’t just be reserved for MAGA supporters and Tesla owners.” A really bad day for America when Trump & Musk team up with Louis DeJoy to attack the USPS. DeJoy just announced that he “signed an agreement with the General Services Administration and DOGE representatives” and is allowing Elon Musk to infiltrate the USPS:… — Congresswoman Mary Gay Scanlon (@RepMGS) March 13, 2025 A really bad day for America when Trump & Musk team up with Louis DeJoy to attack the USPS. DeJoy just announced that he “signed an agreement with the General Services Administration and DOGE representatives” and is allowing Elon Musk to infiltrate the USPS:… Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.) said on social media Thursday: “Louis DeJoy just admitted he agreed to hand over the Postal Service to Elon Musk. This is a blatant move toward privatization, and I will fight to protect our postal workers and ensure affordable service — especially for rural communities.” Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.) said the agreement “threatens millions who rely on USPS for medications, Social Security checks, and staying connected.” National days of action in defense of the Postal Service are planned for March 20 by the American Postal Workers Union and March 23 by NALC.
The order also bans Trump’s Office of Personnel Management from advising any federal agency on which employees to fire. Washington, D.C. — A federal judge in California ordered the Trump administration to immediately reinstate thousands of jobs for probationary federal workers fired as part of billionaire Elon Musk’s campaign to slash the federal workforce. Judge William Alsup ruled Thursday morning that tens of thousands of workers must be rehired across numerous federal agencies, including the departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, extending his previous temporary emergency order issued Feb. 28. Alsup, appointed in 1999 by former President Bill Clinton to the Northern District of California, ruled in favor of numerous plaintiffs that brought the suit against the Trump administration’s Office of Personnel Management. Alsup’s order also prohibits OPM from advising any federal agency on which employees to fire. Additionally, Alsup is requiring the agencies to provide documentation of compliance to the court, according to the plaintiffs who were present in the courtroom. The plaintiffs, which include the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO and other unions representing thousands of federal workers, sued in February over OPM’s “illegal program” terminating employees who are within the first year of their positions or recently promoted to new ones. Everett Kelley, AFGE’s national president, said in statement Thursday that the union is “pleased with Judge Alsup’s order to immediately reinstate tens of thousands of probationary federal employees who were illegally fired from their jobs by an administration hellbent on crippling federal agencies and their work on behalf of the American public.” “We are grateful for these employees and the critical work they do, and AFGE will keep fighting until all federal employees who were unjustly and illegally fired are given their jobs back,” Everett said. The AFGE was among more than a dozen organizations who sued the government. The plaintiffs were represented by the legal advocacy group State Democracy Defenders Fund and the San Francisco-based law firm Altshuler Berzon LLP. Washington state also joined the case and was represented by state Attorney General Nick Brown. The White House said it will contest the ruling and that “a single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch.” “The President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch – singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the President’s agenda. If a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for President themselves. The Trump Administration will immediately fight back against this absurd and unconstitutional order,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. The unions argued in a Feb. 19 complaint that Congress “controls and authorizes” federal employment and spending, and that lawmakers have empowered federal agencies, not OPM, to manage their own employees. OPM, which administers employee benefits and essentially serves as the government’s human resources arm, “lacks the constitutional, statutory, or regulatory authority to order federal agencies to terminate employees in this fashion that Congress has authorized those agencies to hire and manage,” according to the complaint. “nd OPM certainly has no authority to require agencies to perpetrate a massive fraud on the federal workforce by lying about federal workers’ ‘performance,’ to detriment of those workers, their families, and all those in the public and private sectors who rely upon those workers for important services,” the complaint continues. Musk, a Trump special adviser, has publicly and repeatedly touted the terminations as a means to cut federal spending. Mass firings began in early to mid-February and continued as recently as Tuesday when the Department of Education announced it would cut about 50% of its workforce. The terminations sparked numerous lawsuits and public outcry. Musk, who the White House claims has no decision-making authority, has posted on his social media platform X about emails sent to federal workers offering buyouts and demanding they justify their jobs. Musk has also published dozens of posts attacking federal judges who’ve ruled against his workforce downsizing as “evil” and “corrupt.”
Republicans would need eight Democratic senators to join them to pass a continuing resolution to fund the government. Senate Democrats have signaled that they will not support a continuing resolution bill to fund the government that is being offered by Republican lawmakers, setting up a potential government shutdown if a deal cannot be reached by Friday at midnight. The resolution offered by Republicans, already passed in the GOP-run House of Representatives, would make substantial government cuts (including reducing the budget of Washington, D.C. by $1 billion). But it would allow government functions to continue for the next six months — albeit likely with Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) continuing to slash funding and fire federal workers en masse . Democrats face a tough decision: support the resolution and the cuts that come with it (including allowing DOGE to continue to function unimpeded) or block the resolution and risk a government shutdown. The latter option comes with political costs: It could result in voters blaming Democrats for the shutdown, which will inevitably reduce services for Americans for as long as it lasts. Although they are the minority party in the chamber, Senate Democrats can block the measure through a filibuster. Republican Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) has indicated that he won’t support the bill, being the only GOP senator so far to say as much. That means that at least eight Democrats would have to join with Republicans in order to reach cloture on the bill. After a meeting of Senate Democrats on Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) indicated that the conference wouldn’t support the continuing resolution. Schumer spun the blame to Republicans, whom he said made no effort to discuss the matter with Democrats in the several days before the deadline approached. “Funding the government should be a bipartisan effort, but Republicans chose a partisan path, drafting their continuing resolution without any input — any input — from congressional Democrats,” Schumer said on the Senate floor . “Because of that, Republicans do not have the votes in the Senate to invoke cloture on the House CR.” Instead, Schumer said Democrats would call for a one-month “clean” funding bill — one that doesn’t make huge cuts for now but allows for negotiations between the parties to happen during that window. “Our caucus is unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,” Schumer added . “I hope our Republican colleagues will join us to avoid a shutdown on Friday.” But privately, some Democrats have indicated that there is enough support for passing the continuing resolution. According to reporting from The Hill , Schumer is supposedly “giving plenty of room to centrists in his caucus to vote” in favor of the resolution to avoid a government shutdown. Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pennsylvania) is the most outspoken Democrat supporting the bill’s passage. “It’s a CR that we all agree we don’t like — but for me we can’t ever allow the government to shut down,” Fetterman said on CNN Wednesday . But other Democrats have also indicated that they won’t back the bill. “I will be voting NO on the CR,” Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said on X . “Virginians deserve more than letting Elon & Trump run wild through our government, slashing jobs and cutting services. Let’s pass a 30-day extension and get an actual deal done.” Progressive lawmakers have similarly spoken out against the bill, saying it will only empower Republicans to keep doing what they have done so far — and allow President Donald Trump and Musk to continue their legally dubious campaign to gut the federal government. “You run the government. If you have the votes, then go ahead. If you need Democrats, then you need to negotiate with Democrats. Those are your two options,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated on social media . Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) also indicated that she wouldn’t vote for the resolution. “I don’t understand how anyone can support a bill that would give Donald Trump the opportunity to fire another 25,000 veterans and take away nursing home spots from tens of thousands of seniors, all so that the Republicans can give $4.7 trillion in giveaways to billionaires and billionaire corporations,” Warren told reporters .
Department of Housing and Urban Development funds have been disrupted, sometimes through means that are likely illegal. A record number of people are struggling to afford housing, and leaders from across the political spectrum have called for action. But the Trump Administration, including Elon Musk and the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), has taken one step after another that will undermine the most effective policies to help people afford housing, including cutting Housing and Urban Development (HUD) staff, withholding urgently needed funds, and making harmful policy changes. In 2023, 24 million people lived in low-income households that paid over half their income in rent, forcing them to shift money away from other basic needs and often leaving them one setback away from eviction. In January 2024, 770,000 people across the country — an all-time high — couldn’t afford housing at all and were forced to live in shelters, cars, tents, or other unsafe and unstable circumstances. These are solvable problems. Housing Choice Vouchers and similar rental assistance sharply reduce housing instability and overcrowding, research shows, and rental assistance combined with supportive services when needed is the most effective policy for reducing homelessness. Today only 1 in 4 households in need receives rental assistance due to funding limitations, and waitlists for assistance are long almost everywhere. So policymakers should be seeking to expand this highly effective assistance to reach everyone in need . The Trump Administration’s actions, on the other hand, will mean that fewer people who struggle to keep a roof over their heads will get the help they need. Elon Musk and DOGE have reportedly called for discharging at least half of HUD staff overall, sometimes using tactics that may be illegal . Specifically, the proposals would cut: Staff in these offices play a critical role in ensuring that tens of billions of dollars of badly needed federal funds are distributed promptly and used efficiently. Layoffs on the scale that DOGE is seeking will lead to delays and waste, resulting in people and communities around the country getting less help to address urgent needs. In addition, the Administration has interrupted the normal flow of HUD funds that are used to address housing needs, again sometimes through means that are likely illegal . HUD attempted in January to withhold funds as part of a broader federal funding freeze, which multiple federal courts have ordered the Administration to temporarily halt while they review the action. HUD does not appear to have intentionally withheld funds for vouchers and other rental assistance so far, but the uncertainty created by Administration policies has led to payment delays that could cause some landlords to stop accepting vouchers, making it harder for voucher holders to find homes they can rent. Meanwhile, HUD has yet to deliver any of the $3.6 billion in homelessness assistance funding awarded January 17, which communities are counting on to provide rental assistance, shelter, outreach, and other services to people experiencing homelessness. While HUD notified at least some grantees that they will begin to receive funds soon , the uncertainty has disrupted community planning efforts and the final awards may include abrupt policy changes that could complicate implementation. The Administration has also canceled contracts for organizations that help protect people from housing discrimination and provide technical assistance that plays a crucial role in effectively implementing HUD programs — even though the Administration provided no evidence that the organizations were failing to perform as required. Finally, HUD officials have proposed or discussed a series of policy changes that would make it harder for many people in need to receive housing assistance. HUD has said it will publish a rule rolling back non-discrimination protections that guarantee access to safe shelter and housing assistance for transgender and nonbinary people, who experience disproportionately high rates of homelessness. And it has already published a rule weakening fair housing requirements . HUD officials have also called for evicting or cutting off rental assistance for people who don’t meet burdensome work requirements , a step that would increase administrative costs and expose many children, people with serious health conditions or caretaking responsibilities, and others to severe hardship. Rather than squandering resources on costly tax cuts for the wealthy , policymakers should be expanding effective programs toward the goals of ending homelessness and ensuring everyone has a stable, affordable home. And they should make targeted reforms to address shortcomings of those programs to make them even more effective at addressing pressing housing needs. The Administration’s actions will have the opposite effect, making it harder for people to afford housing and exit homelessness.
We’ve already seen individual and small communal acts of subversion. How do we create a sustained uprising? Not even two months since Inauguration Day and it’s already been quite a trip. Ping-ponging between vindictive pettiness and unconstitutional overreach while using everything in his power (and much that isn’t), Donald Trump has served up a goulash of dubious orders with a slathering of venom on top. He’s been abetted in the upheaval he promised on the campaign trail by the richest man on Earth, a cabal of lickspittles, and a cabinet filled with people who appear to have answered job ads stipulating, “Only the unqualified may apply.” As it became clearer what the battles to come would be, a friend wrote me: “I feel now like we’re watching it all happen. It being that thing that can’t happen here.” There would be something strangely exhilarating about the frenzy of activity in Washington, if only it weren’t so careless, mean, dishonest, and destructive. Some of the most egregious actions have indeed been temporarily halted by the courts, but there’s no guarantee that trend will hold up — if, of course, Donald Trump and crew even pay attention to court decisions — especially when cases arrive at what’s potentially “his” Supreme Court. Meanwhile, insidious ideological purges encourage citizens to rat out their neighbors and coworkers, as leaders of industry, the media, and other institutions rush to appease the president before he dissolves into a hissy fit of revenge. (The speed with which many corporations complied with the order to axe DEI programs illuminates how shallow their commitment to that effort really was.) In the months after the election, I mourned, ranted, resorted to magic thinking. I reminded myself that, while Trump did ( barely ) win the popular vote, democracy isn’t something that only happens every four years. Then, after my umpteenth conversation diagnosing how the hell we got into this mess, I had had enough. Okay, I said to my friends (who didn’t deserve my impatience), now what are we going to do about it? Of course, I’m anything but the only person to ask that question. My inbox is crammed with notices of newsletters, podcasts, videos, and Zoom meetings full of rallying cries and, increasingly, suggested responses like the growing “ economic blackouts .” With the executive branch already a kleptocracy, congressional Republicans in a state of amnesia when it comes to the Constitution’s separation of powers, most congressional Democrats waiting all too quietly (with the exception of Bernie Sanders and a few others ) for the midterm elections or for Trump to screw up irremediably, and the courts tied up in rounds of Whac-A-Mole, it falls to civil society — that’s us — to try to check the slash-and-smash rampage of Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and the rest of that crew, while offering a different vision for the country. Such responses will undoubtedly involve a variety of approaches . These are likely to range from the immediate to the long haul; from small, local acts to ease individual lives — accompanying immigrants through the legal process when their residency is imperiled, for example — to more traditional activities like lobbying, petitioning, and supporting civil liberties organizations, or even movement-building and large-scale actions aimed at challenging the power of Trump and changing our very political situation. We’ve already seen individual acts of principle, along with small communal acts of subversion. When someone in the Air Force took the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion purge literally and cut a video about World War II’s Black Tuskegee Airmen from a training course, a senator decried it as “ malicious compliance .” In Silicon Valley, there was a “ quiet rebellion ” when Meta workers brought in certain sanitary products to replace those removed from men’s bathrooms by order of their boss, Mark Zuckerberg. A DOGE hiring site was besieged by mock applications from well-qualified Hitlers, Mussolinis, Francos, and a Cruella De Vil. Then there was that World War II anti-fascism Simple Sabotage Field Manual , downloaded at least 230,000 times since 404 Media made it accessible online. Ways to gum up the works suggested there include, “Cry and sob hysterically at every occasion, especially when confronted by government clerks,” and my fave, “Act stupid.” Traditional forms of lobbying — emails, phone calls, petitions, or attending town hall meetings — have also proved to be important options, but in one of the kinks in democratic representation, the legislators we most seek to influence are often the ones with the least reason or desire to listen to us. My representatives are all outspoken, progressive Democrats, so all I can say is, thanks or try even harder. Meanwhile, good luck getting through to swamped legislative offices, which generally accept messages only from their constituents. And finally, marches and performative protests are photogenic and build solidarity, but because they seldom disrupt much of anything, they are often all too easy to ignore. Moreover, in Donald Trump’s topsy-turvy world, it’s hard to know not just where to direct your protest, but even at whom to direct it. On February 5th and again on a frigid Presidents’ Day , sizeable demonstrations against Trump, Musk, and their policies took place across the country. If you didn’t notice, no surprise there since they barely made a blip in what passes for the news these days (and apparently not even that in Donald Trump’s consciousness). “Attention, not money, is now the fuel of American politics,” writes New York Times columnist Ezra Klein. MSNBC host Chris Hayes, whose most recent book is about attention as a valuable and endangered commodity, has called Trump’s skill at commanding it a “ feral instinct .” He noted that, while the president excels at getting the public’s attention, he’s not all that great at holding it. Still, give Trump credit for his remarkably relentless pace of presidential threats, orders, and mind lint to keep our synapses sparking and, while he’s at it, overwhelming any opposition with the enormity — and folly — of resisting him or his administration. Always leading with his chin, Trump employs a variety of tactics, including: Stating something as fact when it isn’t. He did not win a mandate last November with just 49.7% of the vote; Panama did not agree to a freebie for U.S. ships in its canal; and Ukraine did not start a war with Russia. Repeating and embellishing half-baked ideas — including annexing the Panama Canal and Greenland, turning Canada into the 51st state and Gaza into a golf resort — until they become articles of faith or at least possibilities worth considering. By then, of course, he’s already corralled the discussion. Drowning us in verbiage, belligerence, and hollow proclamations — or, as Steve Bannon put it, “ flooding the zone ” — until it’s impossible to respond. In his first week in office, Trump typically talked so much that even official stenographers scrambled to keep up. Confusing everyone (probably himself included) . Take the inherently illegal directive that froze massive amounts of federal funds already appropriated by Congress. Except it was utterly unclear what money was being frozen and, according to the White House press secretary in her first press briefing , it was legal because the relevant Office of Management and Budget memo said it was. Oh, and then came that other directive rescinding the first one. Except it turned out to apply only to the memo announcing the other directive, not the directive itself. Except… no, wait! That non-rescission applied to previous executive orders. Except… oh, never mind. Whining about “unfairness” to the United States and — yes, of course — him (he often conflates the two) as a cover for bullying people , organizations , and countries into submission. Not giving a damn if he’s caught in a lie or an error or simply sounds nuts as long as the focus remains on him or, these days, on his stand-in, Elon the Enforcer. Ultimately, the last of these may be Trump’s greatest menace, but also his greatest weakness, because what he does give a damn about is his image. It doesn’t take an armchair psychologist to recognize why Trump preens and puffs himself up or a master strategist to know how easy it would be to make him lose his cool (which may be the only time the words “Trump” and “cool” appear in the same sentence). And boy, can he not take — or make — a joke ! So, one simple way we could resist is by denying him our full attention. Of course, we can’t ignore him completely, since willful ignorance is self-defeating and, like an adolescent testing parental limits, he’ll just keep upping the ante to see what he can get away with. But it’s necessary not to be derailed by every inanity or outrage. I’m choosing to concentrate my attention on two or three areas I know something about, while counting on my fellow outragees to attend to other issues. Not that I think Trump cares what I do, but if enough of us focus less on what he says and more on his actions that have discernable policy outcomes, we might indeed be able to cover all the bases and have enough energy and attention left over to push back more quickly and effectively. As for the longer range, I’m tired of being told resistance is futile , not to mention a bad strategy. The Democratic party may be in disarray and protests probably were more impressive during Trump’s first term, but enough already! It’s time to focus on the majority of the electorate who didn’t vote for Trump and who still think democracy is worth working toward. Which leads me to Gene Sharp , an unsung but influential theorist of nonviolent resistance, whose pragmatic ideas about peaceful protest were picked up by popular liberation movements around the world in this century. He argued that the power of governments depends on the cooperation and obedience of those they govern, which means the governed can undermine the power of the governors by withdrawing their consent. “When people refuse their cooperation, withhold help, and persist in their disobedience and defiance,” he wrote, “they are denying their opponent the basic human assistance and cooperation that any government or hierarchical system requires.” While his suggestions for challenging power included individual resistance, he advocated a nonviolent insurgency big enough and sustained enough to make a country ungovernable and so force the governors to truly pay attention to the governed. How big? Political scientist Erica Chenoweth has suggested that about 3.5% of a country’s population participating actively in nonviolent protest can bring about significant political change. If that’s accurate, an effective resistance would need about 12 million Americans taking to the streets. And yes, that’s a lot, but keep in mind that the women’s protest march early in Trump’s first term gathered more than five million Americans on a single day, many of whom were part of a political protest for the first time. When I allow myself to dream big and boldly, I envision a nation of Bartlebys, the title character in a Herman Melville story who replies to all work assignments with the impenetrable refrain, “I would prefer not to.” We Bartlebys, then, would withhold our cooperation by staging a massive national strike. For a day, a week, or as a rolling walk-out, we could shut down the economy and most governmental functions and bring the country to a standstill. But unlike the systemic disruption going on now in Washington, the change would be at the will of millions of Americans cooperating with each other. The United States hasn’t seen a major general strike since 1946, when workers from multiple unions shut down Oakland , California, for 54 hours, but there have been recent, small-scale versions, notably, A Day Without Immigrants this February, when businesses across the U.S. closed in solidarity with the approximately 8.1 million undocumented immigrant workers in this country. Recent actions of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are reportedly driving more workers to unions and, well before the last election, the United Auto Workers invited other unions to align their contract expiration dates in preparation for a giant general strike planned for May Day 2028. But 2028 is a long way off and a lot of damage will be done in the meantime. What I’m envisioning would go beyond organized labor to include anyone who contributes to the economy and civil society, be they employees, managers, owners, government workers, freelancers, independent contractors, retirees, students, homemakers, volunteers, or whomever I’ve missed. Pie in the sky? Probably. I can easily envision 20 things that could go wrong. For starters, even the most grassroots of actions require coordination and a means of communication beyond the capacity of TikTok, while preserving the requisite element of surprise. And some work can’t be safely left undone, even for a day. Worse yet, those in power tend to respond harshly to challenges from below, so it’s not without risk. But there is some safety in numbers and Sharp believed protesters could turn retaliation to their advantage by continuing to struggle nonviolently — he called it “political jiu-jitsu” — only increasing sympathy and support for their cause. Of course, in the era of Donald Trump, organizing millions of people across the country could prove a breeze compared to getting them to agree on a set of demands or even a central goal. But recent polls show that, in what should be Trump’s honeymoon period, his approval rating is 15 points below the historical average for presidents since 1953, when Gallup started keeping track. Overall, the polls indicate that the majority of Americans are not okay with much of what’s going down in Washington now and there are signs that some who voted for Trump are already starting to feel betrayed , if not by him directly, then by Musk, who excels at pissing people off . Twenty years ago, a young veteran who had fought in Iraq and then turned against the war there explained to me why he became involved in the antiwar movement of that time. As he put it, “Someone sees and says, I agree with that guy, I just didn’t have the courage to do it alone. So now he comes and stands next to me. I’m not alone, he’s not alone, and more people come. It just takes one person to start a movement.” To which I would add that imagining change is a crucial step to achieving change. Without it, we’re stuck with Donald Trump and Elon Musk in an untenable present.
A shutdown would actually make it easier for Musk’s DOGE to fire more workers, one expert said. Just days away from a federal funding deadline, several individuals within Elon Musk’s orbit say that the leader of the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) actually wants a government shutdown, as it will potentially make it easier for him to continue gutting federal agencies and firing workers en masse. Four sources speaking to Wired with knowledge of Musk’s thinking said that he wants the current version of the continuing resolution — a bill to fund the government for the next six months — to fail by this Friday’s deadline, a position that runs counter to the Trump administration’s stated goal. “A shutdown has been his preference,” one of those sources told the publication. “ I think he’s boxed in there by the president. I think it would be really hard for him to get around that.” Another source suggested that the economic impact of DOGE’s actions didn’t matter to Musk, so long as it hurt the political adversaries of President Donald Trump. “You know none of this is about saving money, right? It’s all about destroying a liberal power base,” that source said . A shutdown could give Musk more leeway when it comes to firing workers, said Nick Bednar, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Law, in comments to Wired about the situation. Bednar noted that, if a shutdown lasted more than a month, furloughed federal employees would become subject to what’s known as a reduction in force (RIF) action, which would allow terminations of some workers based on seniority or veteran status. But a shutdown could also lead to workers themselves deciding to opt out of staying within the federal workforce. “I suspect the greatest impact of a long-term shutdown is that it will encourage federal employees to leave public service sooner rather than later,” Bednar told the publication . “Even though federal law permits back pay, federal employees still need to pay for rent, groceries, and other essentials. The Trump administration could use an extended furlough to squeeze employees from their positions.” The GOP-led House of Representatives voted on Tuesday to fund the government for the next six months. The measure goes to the Senate for consideration, which must pass the bill or risk a government shutdown by Friday. Democrats are currently split on how they intend to vote on the bill — on the one hand, a shutdown could be viewed as politically disadvantageous to them. On the other, the bill contains several spending cuts (including lessening federal support for Washington, D.C.’s budget by $1 billion ), and would empower Trump and Musk to continue their DOGE project to slash federal agencies, eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs and cutting critical spending. On Wednesday morning, momentum appeared to be heading toward most Democrats backing the bill, The Hill reported , with some in the party’s caucus recognizing that the bill is “horrible” but that a shutdown lasting several weeks would be painful for many Americans. Republicans currently hold a 53-seat majority in the Senate. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) has indicated that he won’t vote to support the continuing resolution ; if he holds true to that pledge, at least eight Democrats would be needed to pass the legislation to overcome a Senate filibuster.
Trump also accused “radical left lunatics” of an “illegal and collusive” Tesla boycott as #TeslaTakedown protests surge. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said he would label attacks on Tesla dealerships as acts of domestic terrorism after “Tesla Takedown” protests and a sharp 15 percent drop in Tesla’s stock on Monday — the company’s worst trading day since 2020. Speaking alongside Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who brought several vehicles to the White House for Trump to pose for photos with, Trump said that he thinks that Musk has “been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people, and I just want people to know that he can’t be penalized for being a patriot.” Trump had recently announced that he plans to buy a Tesla in support of Musk, who has gained significant influence over the U.S. government. In a Truth Social post, Trump praised Musk, saying he was “putting it on the line” for the country and doing a “fantastic” job. “I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,” Trump added . Trump also accused “radical left lunatics” of boycotting Tesla in an “illegal and collusive” manner. Elon Musk told Fox Business in a Monday interview that he was managing his various businesses “with great difficulty.” On Monday, Tesla shares fell more than $40, shrinking Musk’s net worth by approximately $18.8 billion. “Tesla has dipped below the amount it was on election day. We must keep going till it is worthless,” civil rights attorney Alejandra Caraballo said on Bluesky . Caraballo recently shared Musk’s “DOGE” government email on X and subsequently had her account suspended for so-called “doxxing.” Tesla’s stock has plummeted nearly 50 percent over the past three months as Musk’s vocal support for right wing politics and his controversial “DOGE” takeover have alienated parts of the company’s customer base. The company’s downward trajectory has accelerated after Musk traveled to Washington to embrace his self-proclaimed role as “First Buddy,” prompting mass layoffs , department closures , property sales , deep budget cuts and concerns over access to the sensitive data of millions of Americans. In response to these actions — along with Musk’s nazi-like salute at Trump’s inauguration rally — Tesla vehicles, including Cybertrucks, have been dubbed “Swasticars.” A viral social media image tagged #TeslaTakedown features Musk alongside a ghostly outline of Adolf Hitler, and is captioned: “When you ride Tesla you ride with Hitler!” Demonstrators have protested Musk by vandalizing Tesla charging stations, setting them on fire , and spray-painting “Nazi” on vehicles. One woman also threw Molotov cocktails at Tesla dealerships. Last week, gunshots were fired at a Tesla showroom, damaging four vehicles and breaking windows. Authorities noted that while the motive remains unclear, similar attacks on Tesla dealerships have occurred across the country “for political reasons.” “The actions taken against Tesla are a thermometer for the country. It started with some protests and vandalism. It’s now arson of chargers,” Caraballo said on Bluesky . “The worse this gets, the more this country is ready to explode into violence.” Some Tesla owners have begun altering and attempting to return their vehicles. According to The Guardian , after Musk’s Nazi-like salute, a Tesla owner whose grandmother survived the Holocaust called her mother and said, “I’m selling the Nazi mobile.” Another Tesla owner said they felt “nothing but utter disgust” after Musk’s fascist-style salute, adding that they “no longer enjoyed sitting in my Tesla.” Another Tesla owner told The Guardian that he “happily paid $4,000 to get rid of that car” after struggling to sell it.
The billionaire head of DOGE also baselessly suggested immigrants were being lured to the US by these programs. During a Fox Business Network interview on Monday, Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and supposed head of the Trump administration’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), suggested that so-called federal “entitlement” programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid could be the next to face substantial funding cuts under his watch. Musk suggested that somewhere between $500 billion to $700 billion should be cut from those programs , dubiously claiming that was the amount of waste they generated. However, fraud levels for those programs are very low — indeed, an estimate of wasteful spending from Social Security between the years 2015 and 2022 found that only around $71 billion in waste was actually found, equaling less than 1 percent of the total benefits paid out by the program during that time. Entitlement spending is “the big one to eliminate” from federal funding, Musk added. Musk pushed other claims that the programs make payments to “20 million people who are definitely dead,” mirroring assertions he made earlier this month that were also deemed false by fact-checkers . He also baselessly claimed that Democrats are using the programs to attract undocumented immigrants to enter the country “by essentially paying them to come here and then turning them into voters.” Undocumented immigrants cannot legally access benefits from these social safety net programs, though many working in the U.S. are paying taxes toward them . Even if a person can obtain green card status, they are disallowed from accessing benefits for at least five years . Musk’s insistence that he and DOGE could “eliminate” hundreds of billions of dollars from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid spending is inconsistent with previous assurances from President Donald Trump that his administration wouldn’t “touch” those widely popular programs . Recent polling shows Americans want more spending, not less, on these three programs. An Economist /YouGov poll from last week , for example, found that 77 percent of Americans want spending levels kept the same or increased for Medicaid, while 87 percent said the same for Medicare and 88 percent for Social Security. Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders also said Musk’s errant statements on the programs were intentional. “Why do you make it look like it’s a broken, dysfunctional system? The reason is to get people to lose faith in the system and then you can give it over to Wall Street,” Sanders said in a CNN interview on Monday night , reacting to Musk’s statements. He added: I think this is a prelude not only to cutting benefits but to privatizing Social Security itself. I think that’s in the back of their mind, if you make the system dysfunctional, why would anybody want to support it?
A Delaware bill would shield corporate executives from liability while awarding Elon Musk $56 billion. This article was originally published by The Lever , an investigative newsroom. If you like this story, sign up for The Lever ’s free newsletter . In an effort to appease Elon Musk , Delaware’s Democratic-controlled legislature is expected to vote on a bill this month that would not only award Musk the largest compensation package in history, but also shield many of the country’s most powerful corporate executives from accountability for their companies’ misbehavior. If lawmakers don’t enact the law, which was written by Musk’s own lawyers, the billionaire mogul and his allies are threatening a mass exodus of companies out of the state. This pressure campaign is part of a long-running race to the bottom between states competing to attract businesses with offers to shield corporate executives from scrutiny by their companies’ own shareholders and workers. Delaware, which has long been perceived as a billionaire playground and corporate tax haven, is the incorporation home to more than 60 percent of all Fortune 500 companies. That means, if enacted, the wide-ranging regulatory handouts in the bill will have sweeping consequences for corporate behavior across the country. Shareholder lawsuits — used to hold corporations accountable for misconduct — would become much more difficult to bring to court. The law could wipe out many Delaware legal practices, a major state industry , and it could disempower company stakeholders including regular everyday stockholders and workers via their pension funds. The law would set an extremely high bar for plaintiffs to obtain internal company documents, records, and communications — the core pieces of evidence needed to build a lawsuit against a company. Corporate executives and investors with a controlling stake in a firm would no longer be required to hold full shareholder votes on various transactions in which management has a direct conflict of interest. “This law would basically end civil litigation as a mechanism for holding fiduciaries accountable and to ensure that they act in the best interests of shareholders and don’t just line their own pockets,” said Joel Fleming, a partner at Equity Litigation Group, a boutique Delaware-based firm that takes on shareholder lawsuits. The bill amounts to a wishlist of reforms advocated for by a radical fringe of Silicon Valley titans and corporate defense lawyers. If enacted, experts say similar legislation will likely spread across the country as other states like Texas and Nevada compete to hobble their own shareholder protections, fundamentally eroding corporate governance in America. Delaware is inordinately responsive to business backlash because of its economic reliance on the homegrown “incorporation industry.” Nearly two million LLC entities are registered in the state — double the population of actual residents. Most of these companies keep their headquarters elsewhere but exist on paper as a legal entity in Delaware, so they can benefit from the streamlined incorporation process, low taxes, lax regulations, and an extremely business-friendly court system to adjudicate legal disagreements. The state’s 200-year-old Court of Chancery system, designed as a specialized court with expertise to handle business cases, is known for being amenable to corporate interests , most notably in bankruptcy cases. After serving in judiciary roles for 12-year terms , many judges go on to work for big law firms representing the very clients whose cases they were previously ruling on. For example, former Chancery Court Judge William Chandler now works for major law firm Wilson Sonsini and helped craft the Musk bill currently before the legislature. Wilson Sonsini represented Tesla during the 2018 botched negotiations with Musk over his $56 billion dollar pay package, which a judge ruled were not deliberated in good faith, sparking Musk’s calls to leave Delaware. The legislature is equally accommodating to business groups. All updates to corporate law that come before the legislature are first pre-vetted and approved by the Corporate Law Council, an arm of the Delaware State Bar Association and voice of the legal establishment and corporate interests. The council is made up almost entirely of defense lawyers at major law firms. Critics say this unelected body gets more say over Delaware’s legislative agenda than its lawmakers. Even the most corporate-friendly of judicial systems, however, took issue with Musk’s compensation package, siding in favor of a Tesla shareholder lawsuit that alleged he misled investors about his actual compensation. In her December 2024 ruling, Judge Kathaleen McCormick found that Musk abused his dual role as both the CEO and controlling shareholder of Tesla, posing a conflict of interest. Her ruling states that Musk was not forthright in presenting the full scope of the compensation deal he was awarding himself when it was brought before shareholders for a vote in 2018. Musk went ballistic. He berated the judge on his social media platform X, announced he’d move his brain–computer interface company Neuralink’s incorporation status from Delaware to Nevada, and encouraged other CEOs to do the same. Meta and Dropbox along with the activist investor and Musk political ally Bill Ackman followed suit , saying they’d consider leaving the state. Walmart’s lawyers reportedly told lawmakers they might too. But those are the only known high-profile Delaware exits so far. Then, at the start of this year, the Delaware legislature took up Senate Bill 21, which explicitly seeks to override the Chancery judge’s ruling on Musk’s pay package. Democratic Gov. Matt Meyer urged lawmakers to do so at the start of the year to purportedly “stop the bleeding” of businesses fleeing the state. A self-professed movement called “Leave Delaware,” registered as an opaque nonprofit, has mobilized in recent months to defend Musk’s honor while his allies lobby for the bill in the state legislature. Leave Delaware runs a social media account and has a website that offers legal assistance to companies looking to unincorporate from the state. The threats do carry some teeth: Delaware to some extent relies on keeping its business community or risk facing a budget shortfall . But political observers in the state believe that the “DE-Exit” phenomenon is overblown. Lobbyists, in their view, are weaponizing lawmakers’ fears about a capital flight to pressure them to pass Musk’s bill. “We haven’t been presented any actual evidence to support fears of a mass business exodus,” said State Rep. Madinah Wilson-Anton’s (D-Newark). “It’s been a lot of anecdotes from leading lawyers who represent firms that would benefit from the recommended changes.” For one, the numbers don’t add up. Nearly a quarter of the state’s revenues come from the corporate franchise tax , a flat annual fee capped at $250,000 for the largest companies. That revenue base is pretty evenly distributed across over a million businesses. As Dael Norwood, a history professor at the University of Delaware explained, the incorporation industry is a “ volume business, not a value business .” “Delaware has — or rather, should have — an interest in appealing to the largest number of corporate registrants, not the wealthiest billionaires,” said Norwood in a blog post . Musk leaving the state draws headlines, but it’s not materially different than if a medium-sized company left the state from a revenue standpoint. There are other concerns, however. Multiple sources say that lawmakers behind closed doors worry that Musk could leverage his political power as the head of President Donald Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency to cut off federal funding to the state if they don’t bend the knee. At a caucus meeting earlier this month, sources say that Delaware’s Secretary of State, Charuni Patibanda-Sanchez, told lawmakers that the state can’t afford any other budget shortfalls given the federal funding cuts they already anticipate will be coming from DOGE. Still, critics of the bill argue that its risks outweigh any short-term political benefits. “You’re basically dropping a nuclear bomb to kill a fruit fly,” said Christine Mackintosh, a plaintiff lawyer at Grant & Eisenhoferr. Other business leaders have threatened mass corporate exits from Delaware in recent years to get what they want, and yet the state’s incorporation rate has only increased with no signs of abating, according to public data cited by Norwood. The real financial headwinds to the state’s existing local economy may come from Senate Bill 21 being signed into law. By gutting shareholder safeguards, the legal industry that makes up a substantial amount of the workforce in the state could take a massive hit, especially plaintiff firms representing shareholders. “If this passes, you might as well burn the corporate-law textbooks because they won’t matter anymore, it’ll be an entirely new day,” said Mackintosh. Of course, the plaintiffs themselves would also face an extinction-level event. The bill would revoke disclosure requirements for shareholder requests for all kinds of company documents, records, and internal communications. All plaintiffs would be entitled to would be minutes from board meetings, which reveal very little. These alterations would make it almost impossible for shareholders to build any viable lawsuits that could even reach the discovery fact-finding stage of a court case. A few law firms closing down may sound trivial, but the suits they bring deliver billions of dollars to shareholders every year and guard against crony dealmaking. For example, one such shareholder lawsuit in Delaware brought $122 million to shareholders adversely impacted by the merger of CBS and Viacom, a deal that had been rigged to favor the parent company. The controller of the umbrella company, National Amusements Inc., had a financial interest in both merging companies and underpaid for the acquired asset. While plaintiffs are driving some of the interest group opposition to the law, they’re not alone. Even some defense lawyers are spooked by the law’s extremity and how it came to be. Musk’s lawyers, for example, initially circumvented the state bar association without seeking the Corporate Law Council’s sign-off on the language. “In Delaware that’s sacrosanct and it’s ruffled a lot of feathers,” said Mackintosh. Some plaintiffs have even made the case that this bill goes against the interests of defense councils. After all, you need to have someone on the other side of the courtroom to argue against in order to retain any clients. Last week, the Corporate Law Council released a set of recommendations to amend the text of the bill, which will likely be included in the final version of the law. The updates, however, do little to change the substance of the bill and will likely clear the way for it to pass. The bill text also strips out basic safeguards currently protecting shareholders. In some ways, say experts, the bill directly undercuts the model of shareholder primacy that’s dominated corporate America for decades. In the last several years, there’s been a growing revolt by corporate leaders to take back power, as they see it, from the shareholders who they claim are overrepresented in the corporate governance process. In part, it’s a backlash to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) stakeholder capitalism whose proponents often leverage financial positions in companies to push for corporate governance reforms such as sustainability. This power struggle between shareholders and executives has been playing out most visibly in Delaware. Last year, the legislature passed a forerunner to the current bill being debated that similarly overturned a Chancery Court judge’s ruling against an illegal business practice. The bill greenlit special privileges granted by corporations for some of their high-value minority shareholders allowing those actors to exert enormous control over the company’s decision-making without actually owning enough shares to do so. These arrangements , which exist in a legal gray area, are often used by private equity firms to stack the deck in their favor in advance of a full company takeover. “That bill passing was a dry run to see what they could get away with,” said Fleming. “They got a foot in the door and now they’re trying to tear down the entire house.” Musk’s bill continues that fight by giving more power to executives over shareholders. Companies often want to make transactions where there’s an inherent conflict of interest. Executive compensation is the most common scenario: A CEO wants to award himself money technically owned by the shareholders. Another example are mergers and acquisitions in which an executive or controller may have a financial interest in the targeted asset. Shareholders could thus get screwed by the company either paying too much or too little for the acquisition. One recent example involves Jim Dolan, owner of Madison Square Garden in New York City. Dolan wanted to merge two of his own companies, one that owned the Garden and one that negotiated the TV contracts for the events held at the Garden. According to the lawsuit , the acquiring company overpaid for the deal, benefiting Dolan’s bottom line at the expense of shareholders, who eventually settled the case for $85 million. When it comes to these forms of conflicted transactions, companies currently need to get approval from two separate bodies: a committee of fully independent directors and then their shareholders. The Delaware bill would change state law so that companies only need sign off from one of those two bodies. Naturally, many companies would opt for the independent directors committee, whose members are typically more loyal to executive management. The bill also notes that only a majority of members on these committees need to be independent rather than all members. The current standards for so-called “independence” on these committees is already quite limited, according to legal experts. That independence is just from the board of directors, not necessarily the controlling shareholder who holds the real power. In the case of Tesla, that would mean Elon Musk. Rolling back all these shareholder protections has created growing opposition in the state. Joining plaintiff firms are labor unions such as the state’s AFL-CIO whose members’ pension funds are invested in these large companies. If executives at those firms are shielded from legal liability, Fleming says, it enables them to outright steal from workers under the new law. “Erasing forty years of case law would not make Delaware look like a stable or predictable place to do business,” wrote a collection of shareholder counsels in a joint letter to the Delaware General Assembly this month. “It would make Delaware look like a state where Elon Musk can change the law because he lost a case.”
US contributions to international climate funds were already seen as low relative to its wealth and responsibility. Nearly a tenth of global climate finance could be under threat as U.S. president Donald Trump’s aid cuts risk wiping out huge swathes of spending overseas, according to Carbon Brief analysis. Last year, the U.S. announced that it had increased its climate aid for developing countries roughly seven-fold over the course of Joe Biden’s presidency, reaching $11bn per year. This likely amounts to more than 8% of all international climate finance in 2024. However, any progress in U.S. climate finance has been thrown into disarray by the new administration. Trump has halted US foreign aid and threatened to cancel virtually all U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) projects, with climate funds identified as a prime target. USAID has provided around a third of US climate finance in recent years, reaching nearly $3bn in 2023, according to Carbon Brief analysis. Another $4bn of U.S. funding for the UN Green Climate Fund (GCF) has also been cancelled by the president’s administration. One expert tells Carbon Brief that more climate funds will likely end up on the “cutting block.” Another warns of an “enormous gulf” to meeting the new global $300bn climate-finance goal nations agreed last year, if the U.S. stops reporting — let alone providing — any official climate finance. Carbon Brief ’s analysis draws together available data to explain how the Trump administration’s cuts endanger global efforts to help developing countries tackle climate change. The U.S. is by far the world’s largest economy and biggest historical emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2). This means that, while it is the fourth-biggest national provider of international climate finance, its overall share is low relative to the nation’s wealth and responsibility for climate change . As a result, the U.S. has long been seen as a laggard in this area. The U.S. provides 0.24% of its gross national income (GNI) as aid for developing countries, which includes some climate funding. This is the same share as the Czech Republic, a nation with a per-capita GNI three times smaller. U.S. climate-finance contributions stalled during Trump’s first four-year term as president, when other developed countries were ramping up to meet their target of providing and mobilising $100bn a year for developing countries by 2020. A shift in focus came when Biden became president in 2021. He established an international climate finance plan to scale up U.S. efforts, in line with U.S. obligations under the Paris Agreement . Biden also announced that the U.S. would reach $11.4bn in annual climate finance by 2024. This goal was achieved, according to “ preliminary estimates ” announced by the U.S. during the COP29 climate summit at the end of 2024. These estimates, which are unlikely to be confirmed by the new administration, are shown in the chart below. The figures are based predominantly on “ bilateral ” climate finance reported to the UN. They also include US finance distributed via multilateral climate funds, such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the GCF. Bilateral climate finance largely comes from aid programmes with climate benefits, such as supporting a geothermal project in the Philippines, investing in “climate-smart” agriculture in Bangladesh , or improving water security in Niger . The U.S. significantly increased its contribution towards climate finance during the Biden administration. Ramping up relevant U.S. aid projects and multilateral funding helped developed countries to hit the $100bn climate-finance target — albeit two years late in 2022. The $11bn reported by the U.S. in 2024 would be the equivalent of 21% of all bilateral and multilateral climate fund inputs that year — up from around 4% under the previous Trump presidency. These funds are shown by the blue bars in the figure below. (Estimates for 2023 and 2024 assume a steady rise in climate finance from sources beyond the U.S., as official figures beyond then have not been released. See Methodology for more information.) Even when considering other sources of international climate finance — specifically multilateral development banks (MDBs) and “ mobilised ” private finance shown in grey in the figure below — the US has contributed a sizable share in recent years. After lingering around 2% during the last Trump administration, the U.S. share of total climate finance roughly quadrupled to more than 8% in 2024, Carbon Brief analysis suggests. It is also worth noting that the U.S., as the biggest shareholder at the World Bank and a major shareholder at other MDBs , can be linked to a large portion of their finance. This contribution is not factored into official U.S. reporting, so it has not been included in this analysis. Even accounting for MDB contributions, U.S. climate finance spending is still far lower than its “ fair share ,” based on its historical responsibility for climate change and ability to pay. Some analysts have put the U.S. fair share as high as 40-50% of climate finance overall. Upon taking office for the second time in January 2025, Trump immediately took aim at international aid spending and climate action with a flurry of executive orders. One order announced plans to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement and criticised such treaties for “steer American taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require, or merit, financial assistance.” It also “revoked and rescinded” Biden’s international climate finance plan . In another executive order , Trump announced a “pause” on U.S. foreign aid “for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with U.S. foreign policy.” USAID handles 60% of U.S. foreign aid — more than $43bn in 2023 — while the State Department oversees most of the remainder. Trump says he wants to “close down” and his advisor Elon Musk has called it a “ criminal organisation .” Trump requires the approval of Congress to repurpose USAID funds or, indeed, abolish the agency. His administration’s actions have, therefore, been described as “ illegal ” and “ unconstitutional ” by senior Democrats and aid workers. Yet, despite lawsuits and court orders instructing the administration to lift the pause, it has since stated its intention to eliminate more than 90% of USAID contracts and, more widely, $60bn of U.S. foreign aid. This would have major implications for U.S. climate finance. News outlets have reported on the climate-related programmes at risk, sometimes stating that USAID has funded half a billion dollars of climate programmes annually in recent years. This figure, while based on USAID’s own reporting of its clean energy, climate adaptation and nature projects , is a significant underestimate of its total climate-finance contributions. Carbon Brief analysis suggests that USAID contributed $2.8bn of climate finance in 2023, the latest year for which data is available. Other U.S. departments with aid contributions in the OECD database contributed smaller sums, bringing total climate spending up to $2.9bn. This equates to around a third of US climate finance that year. If a similar share from these departments was counted as climate finance in 2024, it would amount to nearly $4bn, Carbon Brief finds. (These are estimates based on “climate-related” aid data reported to the OECD. See Methodology for more details.) Climate-finance experts tell Carbon Brief that these higher figures align with the fact that many aid projects targeting other issues, such as agriculture, have climate components. Dr Ed Carr, a centre director at Stockholm Environment Institute U.S. who has previously worked at USAID, tells Carbon Brief : “The way that the Biden administration was doing stuff and the way that Obama before was doing stuff, start to weave a degree of climate sensitivity into everything…So, basically, a huge percentage of programmes working on some aspect of climate.” Unlike many forms of climate finance, USAID projects include lots of grant-based funding, which many developing countries view as preferable to loans and better suited to supporting climate adaptation. Relevant projects backed by USAID in recent years include support for a food-security programme in Ethiopia, upgrading a dam in Pakistan and protecting water supplies in Peru. The Trump administration has made it clear that “climate” is one of the issues that it is scrutinising as it assesses aid projects for consistency with what it defines as U.S. interests. A survey sent to grant recipients several weeks after the initial executive order asks: “Can you confirm this is not a climate or ‘environmental justice’ project or include such elements?” The remaining billions in climate finance are handled by more than a dozen organisations, distributing grants, loans, development finance and export credits. Around $1.2bn of U.S. climate finance in 2022 was paid into international funds, including the GEF. This amounts to a fifth of the total U.S. climate finance that year. The Biden administration did not release a breakdown of how much money went to these funds in 2023 and 2024. However, in 2023 the country paid out $1bn for the GCF alone. Such funding is also at risk as the new administration pulls away from what the White House calls “international agreements and initiatives that do not reflect our country’s values.” Notably, the U.S. has now cancelled $4bn in funds previously committed to the GCF. ( Biden and Obama pledged $3bn each to the fund. However, neither of them ever delivered more than $1bn of their pledge, leaving $4bn outstanding.) As the chart below shows, this means the U.S. contribution to the GCF is now lower than that of Sweden — a country with an economy 50 times smaller . The GCF is not the only specific fund that has been targeted. The U.S. formally ended its involvement in the UN loss and damage fund , which it pledged $17.6m towards in 2023. It has also withdrawn from the Just Energy Transition Partnership initiative, which included at least $56m in grants to help South Africa transition away from coal power. Another Trump executive order announced a review of “international intergovernmental organisation” membership, including MDBs. There is an assumption that the U.S. will not give up its considerable power in these banks. However, Trump supporters, including those behind the influential Project 2025, have laid out plans for withdrawing the U.S. from the World Bank. A large chunk of the remaining U.S. climate finance in recent years has come from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which committed more than $3.7bn in climate finance in 2024 and a similar amount in 2023. This included loans for a wind power project in Mozambique and a railway to carry critical minerals through Angola. DFC is a development finance institution that invests in private enterprises and was set up under the first Trump administration. It has so far been insulated from U.S. aid cuts and there has been speculation that it may now play a larger role in US foreign policy. Leaning more heavily on DFC, as well as the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM), would not be suitable for climate finance, Ritu Bharadwaj , a climate-finance principal researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), tells Carbon Brief : “If these mechanisms remain intact while grant-based finance is gutted, it signals a shift away from public, needs-based funding toward finance that prioritises US commercial and strategic interests. In other words, what little climate finance remains will likely benefit US corporations first, rather than frontline communities.” Additionally, even if such organisations are favoured by the new administration, this does not mean their climate projects will be protected. Benjamin Black , Trump’s nominee to lead DFC, wrote a blog post about the corporation in January, stating: “The Biden administration’s emphasis on virtue-signaling — such as dedicating 40% of recent commitments to green projects — raises serious concerns.” Carr tells Carbon Brief that more U.S. climate spending could still end up on the “cutting block”: “From what we’ve seen so far, it looks to me like they are going to try and root out everything that they see as clearly related to climate.” He caveats this by noting that some of the money the Biden administration would have counted as climate finance may continue, but not be defined as such. This highlights the importance of accounting when assessing climate finance. Different governments around the world report different things as climate finance, depending on their priorities and political leanings. For example, during the last Trump presidency, the U.S. stopped reporting on climate finance to the UN. When calculating progress towards the $100bn goal during this period, the OECD had to estimate US figures based on “ provisional data ” or averages from previous years . The Biden administration retrospectively reported the missing data from the Trump years in 2021, resulting in the OECD scaling down a previous estimate. Clemence Landers , a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development (CGD) who previously worked at the U.S. Treasury, tells Carbon Brief that a “very educated guess that there will be no reporting from the U.S.” in the coming years. The U.S. government website tracking aid has not been updated since December. If climate finance is not recorded, this could hamper its inclusion in the annual $100bn goal, which lasts until 2025, as well as the $300bn goal that countries agreed on last year at COP29 to replace it, as Landers notes: “That does leave an enormous gulf in terms of the new global climate-finance target.” Climate-finance reporting practices mean that official data can be difficult to analyse in detail. In this article, annual U.S. climate-finance figures for the period 2015-2022 are based on those reported by the US government to the UN in biennial reports (BRs) and, for the years 2021 and 2022, its first biennial transparency report (BTR). These can be considered “official” climate-finance figures. They align with the figures that the U.S. federal government has released and are the ones used to inform the OECD’s assessments of developed countries’ progress towards the $100bn annual target. The figures only include bilateral climate finance and inputs into multilateral climate funds. MDB shares and private finance mobilised are not covered. Again, this aligns with the “climate-finance” totals quoted in progress reports by the Biden administration. The climate-finance totals for 2023 and 2024 are based on releases from the U.S. Department of State during the Biden administration. These figures are for the US financial year (FY), which runs from 1 October to 30 September. However, the FY figures are the same as the calendar year numbers reported to the UN for 2021 and 2022, so Carbon Brief assumes the same is true for 2023 and 2024. Due to the significant time lag in official reporting to the UN, the figures underpinning these totals are not due to be released until 2026. (The previous Trump administration did not report them at all and it is unlikely that the current one will either, now that the U.S. has announced its departure from the Paris Agreement.) Given this time lag, estimates for total international climate finance in 2023 and 2024 are derived from a joint analysis by the think tanks Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), ODI , Germanwatch and ECCO . This calculated likely totals in 2030, based on existing pledges and planned reforms . Carbon Brief assumes a steady trajectory to the overall $197bn estimated under the think tanks’ “business-as-usual” scenario, with bilateral finance, specifically, reaching $50bn by 2025. Climate-finance figures reported to the UN by the U.S. do not include details of the government departments and agencies responsible, making it difficult to determine the share overseen by USAID. The Biden administration also did not report the breakdown between agencies. This data is reported to the OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS), which contains figures up to 2023. However, the information in the CRS is not “official” climate finance, but rather “ climate-related development finance ,” identified as such using Rio Markers . Most countries apply simple coefficients to convert the figures they report to the CRS into their climate-finance submissions to the UN, but the US calculates its climate-finance submissions separately. Nevertheless, to obtain approximate figures, Carbon Brief has assumed that 100% of CRS projects marked as “principal” climate projects and 50% of the projects marked as “significant,” are climate finance. This aligns with a methodology used by other organisations, such as Oxfam, as well as other nations , including Germany, Japan and Denmark. However, it is only a rough estimate. Experts that Carbon Brief consulted stressed the uncertainties of climate finance reporting and said the numbers could be higher or lower.
The Trump administration may weaken a low-cost internet option funded by Biden’s 2021 infrastructure law. Boligee, Alabama — Green lights flickered on the wireless router in Barbara Williams’ kitchen. Just one bar lit up — a weak signal connecting her to the world beyond her home in the Alabama Black Belt. Next to the router sat medications, vitamin D pills, and Williams’ blood glucose monitor kit. “I haven’t used that thing in a month or so,” said Williams, 72, waving toward the kit. Diagnosed with diabetes more than six years ago, she has developed nerve pain from neuropathy in both legs. Williams is one of nearly 3 million Americans who live in mostly rural counties that lack both health care and reliable high-speed internet, according to an analysis by KFF Health News , which showed that these people tend to live sicker and die younger than others in America. Compared with those in other regions, patients across the rural South, Appalachia, and remote West are most often unable to make a video call to their doctor or log into their patient portals. Both are essential ways to participate in the U.S. medical system. And Williams is among those who can do neither. This year, more than $42 billion allocated in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is expected to begin flowing to states as part of a national “ Internet for All ” initiative launched by the Biden administration. But the program faces uncertainty after Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick last week announced a “rigorous review” asserting that the previous administration’s approach was full of “woke mandates.” High rates of chronic illness and historical inequities are hallmarks of many of the more than 200 U.S. counties with poor services that KFF Health News identified. Dozens of doctors, academics, and advocates interviewed for this article unanimously agreed that limited internet service hinders medical care and access. Without fast, reliable broadband, “all we’re going to do is widen health care disparities within telemedicine,” said Rashmi Mullur, an endocrinologist and chief of telehealth at VA Greater Los Angeles. Patients with diabetes who also use telemedicine are more likely to get care and control their blood sugar, Mullur found . Diabetes requires constant management. Left untreated, uncontrolled blood sugar can cause blindness, kidney failure, nerve damage, and eventually death. Williams, who sees a nurse practitioner at the county hospital in the next town, said she is not interested in using remote patient monitoring or video calls. “I know how my sugar affects me,” Williams said. “I get a headache if it’s too high.” She gets weaker when it’s down, she said, and always carries snacks like crackers or peppermints. Williams said she could even drink a soda pop — orange, grape — when her sugar is low but would not drink one when she felt it was high because she would get “kind of goozie-woozy.” Connectivity dead zones persist in American life despite at least $115 billion lawmakers have thrown toward fixing the inequities. Federal broadband efforts are fragmented and overlapping, with more than 133 funding programs administered by 15 agencies, according to a 2023 federal report . “This is America. It’s not supposed to be this way,” said Karthik Ganesh, chief executive of Tampa, Florida-based OnMed, a telehealth company that in September installed a walk-in booth at the Boligee Community Center about 10 minutes from Williams’ home. Residents can call up free life-size video consultations with an OnMed health care provider and use equipment to check their weight and blood pressure. OnMed, which partnered with local universities and the Alabama Cooperative Extension System, relies on SpaceX’s Starlink to provide a high-speed connection in lieu of other options. A short drive from the community center, beyond Boligee’s Main Street with its deserted buildings and an empty railroad depot and down a long gravel drive, is the 22-acre property where Williams lives. Last fall, Williams washed a dish in her kitchen, with its unforgiving linoleum-topped concrete floors. A few months earlier, she said, a man at the community center signed her up for “diabetic shoes” to help with her sore feet. They never arrived. As Williams spoke, steam rose from a pot of boiling potatoes on the stove. Another pan sizzled with hamburger steak. And on a back burner simmered a mix of Velveeta cheese, diced tomatoes, and peppers. She spent years on her feet as head cook at a diner in Cleveland, Ohio. The oldest of nine, Williams returned to her family home in Greene County more than 20 years ago to care for her mother and a sister, who both died from cancer in the back bedroom where she now sleeps. Williams looked out a window and recalled when the landscape was covered in cotton that she once helped pick. Now three houses stand in a carefully tended clearing surrounded by tall trees. One belongs to a brother and the other to a sister who drives with her daily to the community center for exercise, prayers, and friendship with other seniors. All the surviving siblings, Williams said, have diabetes. “I don’t know how we became diabetic,” she said. Neither of their parents had been diagnosed with the illness. In Greene County, an estimated quarter of adults have diabetes — twice the national average. The county, which has about 7,600 residents, also has among the nation’s highest rates for several chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, stroke, and obesity, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. The county’s population is predominately Black. The federal CDC reports that Black Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes and are 40% more likely than their white counterparts to die from the condition. And in the South, rural Black residents are more likely to lack home internet access , according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank. To identify counties most lacking in reliable broadband and health care providers, KFF Health News used data from the Federal Communications Commission and George Washington University’s Mullan Institute for Health Workforce Equity. Reporters also analyzed U.S. Census Bureau, CDC, and other data to understand the health status and demographics of those counties. The analysis confirms that internet and care gaps are “hitting areas of extreme poverty and high social vulnerability,” said Clese Erikson, deputy director of the health workforce research center at the Mullan Institute. Digital Haves vs. Have-Nots Just over half of homes in Greene County have access to reliable high-speed internet — among the lowest rates in the nation. Greene County also has some of the country’s poorest residents, with a median household income of about $31,500. Average life expectancy is less than 72 years, below the national average. By contrast, the KFF Health News analysis found that counties with the highest rates of internet access and health care providers correlated with higher life expectancy, less chronic disease, and key lifestyle factors such as higher incomes and education levels. One of those is Howard County, Maryland, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., where nearly all homes can connect to fast, reliable internet. The median household income is about $147,000 and average life expectancy is more than 82 years — a decade longer than in Greene County. A much smaller share of residents live with chronic conditions such as diabetes. One is 78-year-old Sam Wilderson, a retired electrical engineer who has managed his Type 2 diabetes for more than a decade. He has fiber-optic internet at his home, which is a few miles from a cafe he dines at every week after Bible study. On a recent day, the cafe had a guest Wi-Fi download speed of 104 megabits per second and a 148 Mbps upload speed. The speeds are fast enough for remote workers to reliably take video calls. Americans are demanding more speed than ever before. Most households have multiple devices — televisions, computers, gaming systems, doorbells — in addition to phones that can take up bandwidth. The more devices connected, the higher minimum speeds are needed to keep everything running smoothly. To meet increasing needs, federal regulators updated the definition of broadband last year , establishing standard speeds of 100/20 Mbps. Those speeds are typically enough for several users to stream, browse, download, and play games at the same time. Christopher Ali, professor of telecommunications at Penn State, recommends minimum standard speeds of 100/100 Mbps. While download speeds enable consumption, such as streaming or shopping, fast upload speeds are necessary to participate in video calls, say, for work or telehealth. At the cafe in Howard County, on a chilly morning last fall, Wilderson ordered a glass of white wine and his usual: three-seeded bread with spinach, goat cheese, smoked salmon, and over-easy eggs. After eating, Wilderson held up his wrist: “This watch allows me to track my diabetes without pricking my finger.” Wilderson said he works with his doctors, feels young, and expects to live well into his 90s, just as his father and grandfather did. Telehealth is crucial for people in areas with few or no medical providers, said Ry Marcattilio, an associate director of research at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. The national research and advocacy group works with communities on broadband access and reviewed KFF Health News’ findings. High-speed internet makes it easier to use video visits for medical checkups, which most patients with diabetes need every three months. Being connected “can make a huge difference in diabetes outcomes,” said Nestoras Mathioudakis, an endocrinologist and co-medical director of Johns Hopkins Medicine Diabetes & Education Program, who treats patients in Howard County. Paying More for Less At Williams’ home in Alabama, pictures of her siblings and their kids cover the walls of the hallway and living room. A large, wood-framed image of Jesus at the Last Supper with his disciples hangs over her kitchen table. Williams sat down as her pots simmered and sizzled. She wasn’t feeling quite right. “I had a glass of orange juice and a bag of potato chips, and I knew that wasn’t enough for breakfast, but I was cooking,” Williams said. Every night Williams takes a pill to control her diabetes. In the morning, if she feels as if her sugar is dropping, she knows she needs to eat. So, that morning, she left the room to grab a peppermint, walking by the flickering wireless router. The router’s download and upload speeds were 0.03/0.05 Mbps, nearly unusable by modern standards. Williams’ connection on her house phone can sound scratchy, and when she connects her cellphone to the router, it does not always work. Most days it’s just good enough for her to read a daily devotional website and check Facebook, though the stories don’t always load. Rural residents like Williams paid nearly $13 more a month on average in late 2020 for slow internet connections than those in urban areas, according to Brian Whitacre, an agricultural economics professor at Oklahoma State University. “You’re more likely to have competition in an urban area,” Whitacre said. In rural Alabama, cellphone and internet options are limited. Williams pays $51.28 a month to her wireless provider, Ring Planet, which did not respond to calls and emails. In Howard County, Maryland, national fiber-optic broadband provider Verizon Communications faces competition from Comcast, a hybrid fiber-optic and cable provider. Verizon advertises a home internet plan promising speeds of 300/300 Mbps starting at $35 a month for its existing mobile customers. The company also offers a discounted price as low as $20 a month for customers who participate in certain federal assistance programs. “Internet service providers look at the economics of going into some of these communities and there just isn’t enough purchasing power in their minds to warrant the investment,” said Ross DeVol, chief executive of Heartland Forward, a nonpartisan think tank based in Bentonville, Arkansas, that specializes in state and local economic development. Conexon, a fiber-optic cable construction company, estimates it costs $25,000 per mile to build above-ground fiber lines on poles and $60,000 to $70,000 per mile to build underground. Former President Joe Biden’s 2021 infrastructure law earmarked $65 billion with a goal of connecting all Americans to high-speed internet. Money was designated to establish digital equity programs and to help low-income customers pay their internet bills. The law also set aside tens of billions through the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, to connect homes and businesses. That effort prioritizes fiber-optic connections, but federal regulators recently outlined guidance for alternative technologies , including low Earth orbit satellites like SpaceX’s Starlink service. Funding the use of satellites in federal broadband programs has been controversial inside federal agencies. It has also been a sore point for Elon Musk, who is chief executive of SpaceX, which runs Starlink, and is a lead adviser to President Donald Trump. After preliminary approval, a federal commission ruled that Starlink’s satellite system was “ not reasonably capable ” of offering reliable high speeds. Musk tweeted last year that the commission had “ illegally revoked ” money awarded under the agency’s Trump-era Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. In February, Trump nominated Arielle Roth to lead the federal agency overseeing the infrastructure act’s BEAD program. Roth is telecommunications policy director for the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Last year, she criticized the program ’s emphasis on fiber and said it was beleaguered by a “woke social agenda” with too many regulations. Commerce Secretary Lutnick last week said he will get rid of “burdensome regulations” and revamp the program to “take a tech-neutral approach.” Republicans echoed his positions during a U.S. House subcommittee hearing the same day. When asked about potentially weakening the program’s required low-cost internet option, former National Telecommunications and Information Administration official Sarah Morris said such a change would build internet connections that people can’t afford. Essentially, she said, they would be “building bridges to nowhere, building networks to no one.” “That Hurt” Over a lunch of tortilla chips with the savory sauce that had been simmering on the stove, Williams said she hadn’t been getting regular checkups before her diabetes diagnosis. “To tell you the truth, if I can get up and move and nothing is bothering me, I don’t go to the doctor,” Williams said. “I’m just being honest.” Years ago, Williams recalled, “my head was hurting me so bad I had to just lay down. I couldn’t stand up, walk, or nothing. I’d get so dizzy.” Williams thought it was her blood pressure, but the doctor checked for diabetes. “How did they know? I don’t know,” Williams said. As lunch ended, she pulled out her glucose monitor. Williams connected the needle and wiped her finger with an alcohol pad. Then she pricked her finger. “Oh,” Williams said, sucking air through her teeth. “That hurt.” She placed the sample in the machine, and it quickly displayed a reading of 145 — a number, Williams said, that meant she needed to stop eating.

Women and allies took to the streets from coast to coast Saturday for a “Unite and Resist” national day of action. Women and their allies took to the streets of cities and towns from coast to coast Saturday for a “Unite and Resist” national day of action against the Trump administration coordinated by Women’s March. “Since taking office, the Trump administration has unleashed a war against women driven by the Project 2025 playbook, which is why, more than ever, we must continue to resist, persist, and demand change,” Women’s March said, referring to the Heritage Foundation-led blueprint for a far-right overhaul of the federal government that, according to the Guttmacher Institute, “seeks to obliterate sexual and reproductive health and rights.” “This is our day to stand together, make our voices heard, and show the world that we are not backing down,” Women’s March added. “Women’s rights are under attack, but we refuse to go backward.” Scenes from today’s Women’s March in San Diego. #Resist pic.twitter.com/RfRfk6S47G Women’s March executive director Rachel O’Leary Carmona asserted that “the broligarchy that owns Trump is working to ‘flood the zone’ with hateful executive actions and rhetoric, trying to overwhelm us into submission.” “But we refuse to lose focus,” she vowed. “We refuse to stand by.” In San Francisco, where more than 500 people rallied, 17-year-old San Ramon, California high school student Saya Kubo gave the San Francisco Chronicle reasons why she was marching. “Abortion, Elon Musk , educational rights and trans rights, LGBTQ rights, climate change — all of these things, I am standing up for what I believe in,” she said. Her mother, 51-year-old Aliso Kubo, said that “we came out here specifically to support my daughter and women’s rights.” Thousands rallied down the coast in Los Angeles, where protester Pamela Baez told Fox 11 that she was there to “support equality.” “I think I mostly want people to be aware that women are people. They have rights,” Baez said. “We just want to show everybody that we care about them. People deserve healthcare. Women deserve rights.” “I fear for our democracy & our rule of law.” 85 year old Betty Slade rented a bus to bring 40 people from #CapeCod to the IWD Unite & Resist rally & march that began on #Boston Common. She’s been to many protests, but says things under #Trump are worse than ever. @wbznewsradio pic.twitter.com/XGe3pgOrSe Thousands of people rallied on Boston Common on a chilly but sunny Saturday. “We are the ones who are going to stand up,” participant Ashley Barys told WCVB . “There is a magic when women come together. We can really make change happen.” Boston protester Celeste Royce said that “it was really important for me to be here today, to stand up for human rights, for women’s rights, to protect bodily autonomy, to just make myself and my presence known.” Sierra Night Tide told WLOS that seeing as how Asheville, North Carolina had no event scheduled for Saturday, she “decided to step up and create one.” At least hundreds turned out near Pack Square Park for the rally: Today at the Women's March in Asheville, NC pic.twitter.com/BPAIZORSUd “As a woman who has faced toxic corporate environments, living with a physical disability, experienced homelessness, and felt the impact of Hurricane Helene, I know firsthand the urgent need for collective action,” Night Tide said. “This event is about standing up for all marginalized communities and ensuring our voices are heard.” Michelle Barth, a rally organizer in Eugene, Oregon, told The Register Guard that “we need to fight and stop the outlandish discrimination in all sectors of government and restore the rights of the people.” “We need to protect women’s rights. It’s our bodies and our choice,” Barth added. “Our bodies should not be regulated because there are no regulations for men’s bodies. Women are powerful, they are strong, they’re intelligent, they’re passionate, they are angry, and we’re ready to stand up against injustice.” Hundreds gathered to rally and march the streets of downtown Saturday – one of several events that happened around Colorado Springs for International Women’s Day. @csgazette pic.twitter.com/q0oCGm7Zkz In Grand Junction, Colorado, co-organizer Mallory Martin hailed the diverse group of women and allies in attendance. “In times when things are so divisive, it can feel very lonely and isolating, and so the community that builds around movements like this has been so welcoming and so beautiful that it’s heartwarming to see,” Martin told KKCO . In Portland, Oregon, protester Cait Lotspeich turned out in a “Bring On the Matriarchy” T-shirt. “I’m here because I support women’s rights,” Lotspeich said in an interview with KATU . “We have a right to speak our minds and we have a right to stand up for what is true and what is right, and you can see that women are powerful, and we are here to exert that power.” The United States was one of dozens of nations that saw International Women’s Day protests on Saturday. In Germany, video footage emerged of police brutalizing women-led pro-Palestine protesters in Berlin.
Musk’s DOGE takeover is the first step in shaping government to his whims. The next steps could be even more terrifying. As billionaire Elon Musk seizes control over vast swaths of the U.S. government, blurring the line between his private business empire and the state, some analysts have begun to call this takeover what it is: a coup. This corporate coup may not look like the military coups we are familiar with — often backed by the U.S. itself — but it is not without precedent. The unfolding crises in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo show just how quickly this kind of unchecked corporate power can lead to state takeover and widespread violence. As the U.S. descends further down this path by the day, these examples hold a crucial warning. In 2019, in response to widespread protests demanding regime change, long-time Sudanese dictator Omar al-Bashir contracted a private militia group called the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to act as the presidential palace’s personal security. The choice backfired: Al-Bashir was himself deposed in a coup in partnership with the very militia that he had hired. Later that year, in a violent crackdown, the militia publicly massacred protestors staging a sit-in calling for civilian, not military, rule. With every coup comes a power vacuum and, with the help of Emirati and Israeli backers, the RSF seized the power vacuum, overtook the Sudanese military and violently established control over much of the country. The militia’s founder and leader is Chadian billionaire warlord Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo. His forces function as a corporate entity, profiteering off war, controlling state resources and using violence as a business strategy. The RSF began as a transnational corporation that dealt in war crimes globally, hired as mercenaries in counterinsurgency campaigns throughout the Middle East and North African region. In 2014, they were contracted by Saudi Arabia to massacre Houthis in Yemen . In 2017, they were deployed by the European Union as mercenary border patrol to violently stop migrants attempting to make their way to Italy. In 2019, they were hired by the former Libyan military commander to aid in his military campaign targeting civilians in Libya . Now, in the U.S., another corporate coup is unfolding. In recent months, Elon Musk has increasingly acted as an unelected power broker, using his economic and political might — including his influence in the spheres of telecommunications, militarism and artificial intelligence — to undermine democratic institutions and reshape the government in his own image. Musk’s influence extends far beyond the private sector. His power manifests through private ventures that dictate public policy — from X’s (formerly Twitter) control over the public conversation to Starlink’s role in global conflicts . His satellites control critical military and civilian communications. His companies, including Tesla, StarLink, SpaceX and StarShield, SpaceX’s military subsidiary, are deeply embedded in national security infrastructure, while his growing AI and data collection through X gives him unprecedented political sway. Now, Musk is openly using his wealth and influence to stage what can only be described as a corporate coup. Musk is effectively seizing federal spending and usurping the congressional power of the purse with his newly created “Department of Government Efficiency.” Just as Hemedti used the RSF to consolidate his control over Sudan, Musk is positioning his private empire as the backbone of an authoritarian takeover in the U.S. With Starlink increasingly playing an outsized role in critical communications infrastructure, Tesla’s surveillance systems tracking intimate data and AI-driven disinformation sourced from X flooding the media landscape, Musk’s coup is not coming in the form of tanks on the White House lawn — it is happening in boardrooms, data centers and the back channels of government contracts. Hemedti has managed to operate the RSF at its current scale primarily due to external support, with most of the funding and weaponry for the RSF coming from the United Arab Emirates. And much like Hemedti in Sudan, Musk is not acting alone. He is coordinating with a network of people who see democracy as an obstacle to their control. The U.S. Supreme Court’s 2024 decision in Trump v. United States laid the groundwork for a bleak future in the U.S. The dissenting judges raised the hypothetical that a president could deploy the Navy’s Seal Team 6 as his personal militia. In a broad expansion of presidential immunity from criminal consequences, the justices warned that the ruling functionally permitted a sitting president to wield state violence for private gain. The court quietly greenlit the type of corporate coup that has already engulfed Sudan. One of the fundamental principles of a functioning nation-state is the monopoly on the legitimate use of force. When that monopoly dissolves — whether in Sudan, where the RSF now controls entire regions, or in the U.S., where a sitting president could theoretically deploy private mercenaries with legal impunity — chaos follows. The rise of private militias is not just a symptom of state collapse; it accelerates it. Consider how private armies operate: They are not bound by the same rules as national militaries. They answer not to a constitution or a civilian government but to the highest bidder. The RSF, for example, sustains itself through gold smuggling, foreign contracts and exploitation of Sudanese resources. In the U.S., entities like Erik Prince’s former Blackwater (now Academi) have already demonstrated the dangers of privatized warfare, from civilian massacres in Iraq to clandestine counterterrorism operations . Musk’s SpaceX is already actively being used to coordinate military operations, with its military subsidiary StarShield . Recent reports have found that nearly 100 private mercenaries from an American private company, UG Solutions, are contracted to be used in Gaza. The difference between a mercenary force in a foreign war and one used domestically to suppress dissent is merely a matter of time and political will. This reality might come sooner than we think, as Erik Prince and his fellow mercenaries pitch the Trump administration on a plan to establish “processing camps” on U.S. military bases and deploy a private force to arrest migrants within the U.S. Prince, a close ally of Donald Trump , played a key role in backchannel diplomatic efforts, including a secret 2017 meeting in the Seychelles that was reportedly intended to establish a covert line of communication between the Trump administration and Russia. While the parallels between Musk’s corporate overreach and Hemedti’s warlord capitalism are striking, it is crucial to acknowledge the fundamental differences between the U.S. and Sudan. The conditions that enabled Hemedti’s rise — decades of colonial extraction, neocolonial meddling and the deliberate destabilization of Sudan’s political institutions — are not identical to the factors driving Musk’s consolidation of power. Sudan’s trajectory was shaped by imperialist forces that systematically dismantled its ability to maintain state sovereignty, while the United States, as an imperial core, has long been the architect of such destabilization elsewhere. However, the concept of the imperial boomerang — the idea that tactics of control developed in the periphery inevitably return to the center — helps explain how forms of corporate authoritarianism refined in places like Sudan and Congo are now manifesting in the U.S. The analogies must therefore be drawn carefully: Musk is not Hemedti, and the United States is not Sudan. But the underlying mechanism — unaccountable private power overtaking public governance — is the same. While Sudan provides the most direct warning, another unfolding crisis underscores the global nature of this phenomenon: the resurgence of the M23 militia in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Much like the RSF, M23 is not simply a rebel group — it is a corporate-backed paramilitary force acting as an occupying power. Supported by Rwanda, M23 has seized key mining regions in eastern Congo, displacing thousands and securing access to vast deposits of coltan, gold, and other critical minerals essential to the global tech supply chain. M23’s purpose is not ideological but economic. It secures strategic resource hubs, brokers deals with foreign actors and sustains itself through transnational networks of financing. In the same way that Hemedti profits from Sudan’s gold and RSF-controlled trade routes, M23 functions as a business venture in addition to wielding a military faction. The deeper problem is that both private militias and the entities who fund them exist in a legal gray zone. Under international law, war crimes and crimes against humanity are prosecutable when committed by state actors or state-backed forces. But what happens when the actors are corporate entities? The International Court of Justice cannot hear cases involving private corporations in genocide. Whilst the International Criminal Court may prosecute individuals, it has historically focused on heads of state, not corporations or billionaire executives. The United Nations has repeatedly failed to regulate private military companies beyond issuing toothless condemnations. This legal vacuum is not accidental; it is the result of decades of lobbying and legal maneuvering to ensure that the world’s most powerful economic actors remain beyond the reach of justice. Despite the atrocities committed by the RSF — including mass executions, forcible displacement, ethnic cleansing and sexual violence — there is no clear international legal mechanism to hold them accountable as a corporate entity. Hemedti himself remains not just free but powerful, using his wealth to shield himself from justice. The same impunity extends to M23’s leadership in Congo, which continues its operations despite overwhelming evidence of war crimes. An unelected plutocrat seizes government infrastructure, wields control over telecommunications and raids the treasury for personal gain. A billionaire-backed political strongman uses a loyal militia to usurp democracy. These are not the hallmarks of rogue states; they are the logical outcome of corporate authoritarianism. What is happening in Sudan is not an isolated crisis — it is a warning. The fusion of private capital, military power and unchecked corporate immunity is not just a problem for “fragile” states; it is a global threat. Sudan and Congo are the testing grounds. The United States could be next. If a private security force massacres civilians on behalf of a political leader, if a corporate-funded militia stages a coup — who is held responsible? As of now, no one. When private militias operate with immunity, when billionaires dictate government policy, and when corporate leaders wield military power without consequence, democracy ceases to function. The only way to stop this slide into corporate authoritarianism is to confront the legal black hole that allows it to exist. That means pushing for international accountability mechanisms for corporate war crimes, breaking the legal immunity of billionaires who fund paramilitary violence and reinforcing the principle that no private entity can wield the power of a state. The question is not whether the U.S. is immune to the fate of Sudan or Congo. It is whether Americans will recognize the warning signs before it is too late.
Musk views empathy as a “bug” that threatens his political agenda. This framing is instructive. Musk views empathy as a “bug” that threatens his political agenda. This framing is instructive. On Tuesday, Trump addressed a joint session of Congress, bloviating for a record-breaking hour and 40 minutes. The speech was filled with the kind of lies, vitriol, and self-adulation we have come to expect from the current president. Notably, Trump affirmed, during his speech, that Elon Musk is in charge of the infamous Department of Government Efficiency. “I have created the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, perhaps you’ve heard of it, which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight,” Trump said. Trump’s administration has repeatedly stated that DOGE is not, in fact, headed by Musk, as legal challenges around the entity have mounted. Since Trump’s speech, multiple legal filings have cited Trump’s affirmation of what has long been clear to the public: when it comes to the looting of the federal government, Elon Musk is in control. Trump’s speech was predictably ugly and overlong, and included few surprises. “Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is gone,” Trump rambled. Some Democrats present responded to Trump’s rhetoric by holding up small signs bearing messages that included, “Musk Steals,” “Save Medicaid,” and “Protect Veterans.” Many observers have compared the signs to ping pong paddles. Personally, I thought they looked more like auction paddles, but whether one associates the signs with table tennis or an elite shopping exercise, the imagery was not favorable. The signs were roundly mocked on social media, as some declared the effort was “ giving bingo .” Representative Al Green disrupted Trump’s speech, rising to his feet, raising his cane, and declaring that Trump had no mandate to cut Medicaid. Green was ultimately removed from the chamber by the Sergeant at Arms, while Republicans cheered and Democrats clutched their paddles. Congressional Democrats offered us a valuable lesson that night: This is what failure, ineptitude, and an unwillingness to protect others look like. Meek expressions of disapproval — from flimsy signs to an inconsistent attempt at rebellious(?) color coordination — made most Democrats in attendance appear unserious, and the contrast between their sad efforts, and Green’s loud, defiant gesture, only served to emphasize their weakness, as did their abandonment of their colleague. Some Democrats have gone beyond abandonment, with ten Democratic House members joining Republicans in a vote to sanction Green. It’s worth noting that representatives Jasmine Crockett and Maxwell Frost walked out during Trump’s speech. Each removed their jackets as they left, revealing messages on their t-shirts that read “RESIST” and “No kings live here,” respectively. A small cohort of Democrats followed them as they made their exit. Bernie Sanders also walked out during the speech. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Patty Murray opted not to attend the address. While congressional Democrats fail to mount any meaningful opposition to Trump’s agenda in Washington D.C., Elon Musk is bragging publicly about the “revolution” he is leading. In a recent, three hour-long conversation with podcaster Joe Rogan, Musk opined, “DOGE is a threat to the bureaucracy. It’s the first threat to the bureaucracy. Normally, the bureaucracy eats revolutions for breakfast. This is the first time that they’re not, that the revolution might actually succeed.” Revolution was a recurring theme in Musk’s remarks during the interview. When Rogan claimed that Trump was restrained by “neocon” appointees during his first administration, but faced no such obstruction during his second term, Musk noted, “This is a revolutionary cabinet. Maybe the most revolutionary since the first revolution.” The sprawling conversation included a flurry of misinformation, as Musk sought to beat back criticism around the havoc DOGE has caused nationally and internationally. Rogan affirmed each round of Musk’s nonsense with statements like, “It’s so fascinating that people can’t see this.” While Musk acknowledged “mistakes” such as DOGE’s discontinuation of ebola prevention efforts, he also attempted to cast doubt on the validity of the work DOGE had disrupted. “It could be the kind of thing where you sort of fund Ebola prevention, but it turns out that actually you’re funding a lab that develops new Ebola,” Musk said. Musk offered no evidence to back this claim, or his assertion that “DEI” had forced “a bunch of really good, talented old white guys” out of the Federal Aviation Administration, creating an air traffic controller shortage. Musk regularly amplifies, repeats, or simply invents hoaxes. The richest man in the world lies with abandon, secure in the knowledge that fact-checking efforts will not reach or impact his target audience. The mediasphere is incredibly fractured, and selective exposure means that many people will only encounter media that affirms, rather than corrects, their worldview. However, even people who are exposed to and believe corrections are not immune to the influence of misinformation. Studies have shown that even after being exposed to the truth, misinformation continues to shape people’s perspectives. Musk is seeking to affirm what feels true to people who want to believe in the Trump administration. Some will cling to those stories, even in the face of correction. But even if they feel forced to abandon a particular lie, there will always be more to choose from. The end game of this approach is to make facts irrelevant , since new “facts” can always be generated to support the right-wing position. Musk has turned his social media platform into a misinformation machine, offering a constant flow of fascist myths and fantasies to justify the actions of right-wingers and oligarchs. Meanwhile, DOGE has initiated cuts at the Social Security Administration that former SSA chief Martin O’Malley has warned could lead to a “system collapse and an interruption of benefits.” Musk attacked Social Security during his interview with Rogan, calling the program “the biggest ponzi scheme of all time.” He also made baseless claims that “entitlement fraud” is attracting immigrants from around the world to the United States. “If you end the illegal alien fraud, you turn off the magnet,” Musk claimed — framing DOGE’s gutting of federal programs and congressional attacks on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program as efforts to stem the flow of immigration. In addition to conjuring a completely false motive for immigration, and erasing the catastrophic conditions that actually lead people to migrate (conditions that the United States has often played a role in creating), Musk is also attempting to use anti-immigrant sentiment to prop up his lawless slash-and-burn attacks on federal programs. Musk is trying to further weaponize xenophobia and contempt to gain popular support for cuts that are throwing hundreds of thousands of people out of work (including tens of thousands of veterans), imperiling family-owned farms , jeopardizing climate catastrophe warning systems , depriving foreign aid recipients of care (including malnourished infants and HIV patients), and creating conditions that could disrupt the distribution of Social Security benefits, among other harms. In the hopes of spurring privatization, including massive contracts that would replace human bureaucracy with AI systems (an industry he is angling to dominate), Musk is invoking anti-immigrant bigotry. Now, I want to return for a moment to Musk’s comments about bureaucracy. Musk talks about bureaucracy as being more powerful than government officials. He claims that bureaucracy eats revolutions for breakfast, and that DOGE has been the exception to this rule. He is seeking to gut the machinery of government, which he believes has previously restrained people like Trump, and replace it with algorithmic governance. Even as AI technology flounders in the corporate world, Musk clearly believes he is poised to use this technology to overtake the US government and replace human bureaucracy with a monarchistic apparatus. With algorithmic governance, there would be no resistance, no shame, no compassion, and no fear of prosecution to interrupt the execution of oligarchical whims. This is Musk’s vision, and it’s why he is battling with Open AI to dominate a troubled industry. He wants the United States to be powered by Starlink and xAI. If the richest man in the world owns all of the machinery of the US government, he can fulfill anti-democratic tech blogger Curvis Yarvin ’s dream of a state “CEO” — which Yarvin describes as a kind of monarchy. Given Musk’s current level of power over the federal apparatus, that dream is clearly in the process of being realized. The removal of human agency and emotion from governance is consistent with Musk’s views on empathy, which he recently shared with Rogan. “We’ve got civilizational suicidal empathy going on,” Musk said. Musk qualified his remarks slightly, noting that he is not wholly opposed to empathy, but nonetheless believes that empathy is destroying Western civilization. “I believe in empathy, I think you should care about people. But you need to have empathy for civilization as a whole, and not commit civilizational suicide,” he said. After repeating multiple falsehoods about immigrants, Musk claimed it was empathy that had allowed immigrants to become a threat to the United States. “The fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy. The empathy exploit — they’re exploiting a bug in western civilization, which is the empathy response,” Musk said. Musk views empathy as a “bug” that threatens his political agenda. This framing is instructive. Musk is seeking to weaponize animus, in order to justify his destructive, self-serving actions, and that means he needs our resentments to outweigh our regard for other people, and ourselves. This means that to effectively oppose him, we have to focus on our connectedness and our shared regard for the people being harmed by DOGE, Musk, and Trump. Rather than simply recounting and denouncing each new outrage, we must keep this administration’s victims front and center in our narratives. We must uplift the stories of people whose lives are being lost, endangered or undone. Who is being harmed? Who is being threatened? What outcomes do those people deserve? This, we must emphasize, is what we are fighting for. We must constantly reiterate that we are acting in solidarity with, and in defense of, targeted and harmed communities. We must build narratives around our shared humanity, rather than grounding our politics in contempt. While it’s true that some people are contemptible, and some enemies must be fought, our guiding narrative must be based in compassion, what we love, and what we’re fighting for. For progressives and leftists who are frustrated with one another, and who may be deeply disappointed with the choices some community members have made, this will also mean moving away from a tendency to center critique and disqualification. We will not build strong movements around our resentments. We must move in spite of them. This is a time to invest deeply in mutual aid and community defense. Lately, I’ve noticed a shift among some progressives — away from prioritizing the protection of vulnerable people and toward a singular focus on protests aimed at stopping DOGE. Protest is necessary, but scattered demonstrations alone will not build the solidarity needed to survive the months and years ahead. To counter the forces of alienation and animosity that seek to divide us, we must build a culture of care. By creating as much safety and justice as we can, wherever we are, we will forge bonds that will sustain us in moments of collective resistance and refusal. As Democrats have shown, status quo politics are no match for Musk’s agenda. The techno-fascist revolution will not be beaten back with ping-pong paddle signage. We must live in opposition to it, which means being deeply invested in one another. Rather than being ruled by our resentments, we must be empowered by our collective concern for each other. The techno-fascist worldview would leave us isolated from one another, indifferent to reality, and unconcerned with the suffering of others. To defeat it, we must build our own revolution — one rooted in solidarity, not disposability. In Let This Radicalize You , Mariame Kaba and I wrote about a revolution of reciprocal care — a movement where refusing to abandon one another is fundamental to our politics. This is how we will survive together. This is how we will build the capacity to win: by insisting on the value of each other’s lives, no matter how much men like Musk seek to degrade us.
The news organization has filed more than a dozen FOIA requests based on the newly found email address. An independent news organization has obtained and published Elon Musk’s government email to encourage others to file Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests in order to make his work as head of the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) more transparent. The Intercept , an investigative news website , announced that it had uncovered Musk’s email address on Thursday . It listed Musk’s government email as “erm71@who.eop.gov.” “The email address reflects his attachment to the White House Office, the Executive Office of the President, and, apparently, Musk’s full initials plus his birth year, 1971,” The Intercept article written by media law attorney and reporter Shawn Musgrave stated. The publication justified the printing of Musk’s email info by noting that it could lead to more transparency at the legally dubious “department” he leads , including through additional FOIA requests by other news outlets. The Intercept stated that it has filed more than a dozen FOIA requests based on the newly unearthed email address alone. Wrote Musgrave : FOIA works best when requests are as specific as possible. The U.S. government sometimes plays games with journalists, researchers, and other watchdogs, rejecting asks it considers too vague — such as requests for correspondence that fail to include an official’s government email address. The report from The Intercept recognizes that, by placing Musk in the White House, the Trump administration “has taken measures to shield Musk and DOGE from public accountability and transparency, including by making the case that DOGE itself is not subject to FOIA at all.” But the report also indicates that many groups advocating for more transparency in government believe those standards are worth challenging, especially given how DOGE’s actions have impacted myriad departments and agencies across the federal government. “The government has given shifting and conflicting answers on Mr. Musk’s role, what DOGE is doing, and under what legal authority DOGE is operating,” Donald Sherman, chief counsel at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told The Intercept . “At every step, despite promising maximal transparency, taking every step they possibly can to shield DOGE’s operations from the public and from Congress,” Sherman added. DOGE has indeed faced widespread backlash for its lack of transparency, as well as for its outlandish claims that it has supposedly saved billions of taxpayer dollars through the cuts it’s made to federal agencies — claims that have frequently turned out to be false or misleading and have oftentimes been erased from the DOGE website after reporting showcased the errors. A late February analysis of government contracts ended by DOGE, for example, found that nearly 4 out of every 10 of them didn’t net any real savings at all . A FOIA request was filed against the Musk-managed department late last month by the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit group that aims to protect endangered species — alongside the request, the group also filed a lawsuit seeking to expedite and enforce it. Although DOGE faces a plethora of lawsuits, this appears to be the first one to request that it be more transparent with its work, according to a report from NBC News . “FOIA was designed to ensure that monumental and consequential undertakings such as this could not take place without transparency,” the filing by the organization states . “Yet that is what is occurring as Defendants are engaging in wholesale disregard for FOIA’s pro-disclosure mandate.” Americans overall are worried about DOGE’s work, including how it could directly benefit Musk himself, as the department has torn through several agencies that have previously regulated his businesses or were likely to do so in the future. Nearly 6 in 10 Americans (57 percent) have expressed those concerns, according to an Economist /YouGov survey published last month .
The ads include misinformation that is aimed at dissuading undecided voters from choosing the liberal candidate. A far right political action committee (PAC) that is largely funded by billionaire Elon Musk is producing social media ads and text messages that aim to deceive Wisconsin voters by falsely claiming to be in support of the liberal candidate in the upcoming state Supreme Court race. The group, which calls itself “Progress 2028,” is producing ads that appear to be supportive of Judge Susan Crawford, the nominally liberal candidate in the statewide election set to be held on April 1. But the language used in the ads is aimed at dissuading undecided voters, telling them that Crawford is “stand up for immigrants” and giving people formerly convicted of crimes “second chances.” The ads also wrongly claim that Crawford is against incarceration of any kind, which the candidate is not. As it turns out, Progress 2028 is actually managed by Building America’s Future , a right-wing PAC that supports President Donald Trump and receives much of its funding from Musk. This isn’t the first time Progress 2028 and Building America’s Future have tried to deceive voters. The groups used the same tactics during the 2024 presidential election , giving undecided voters errant information about then-Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, in hopes that their messaging would discourage voters from backing her at the polls. Musk has been funding Building America’s Future for years , even before he endorsed Trump in the 2024 election. The group has spent around $2 million in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race so far; Musk’s own group, America PAC, has spent an additional $3.2 million . Musk has a significant financial stake in the outcome of the election — if his preferred candidate, right-wing Judge Brad Schimel, wins, the balance of the court will shift from liberal to conservative control this year. Currently, Musk’s electric automobile company Tesla is suing Wisconsin over a regulatory decision that prohibits car manufacturers from also being able to own dealerships in the state. Regulators recently determined that the company didn’t qualify for an exemption to that law, resulting in Tesla filing a petition in Outagamie County court in January. The case could eventually make its way to the state Supreme Court. If Schimel wins the race, he wouldn’t necessarily have to recuse himself from the Tesla lawsuit, if it does indeed reach the state’s highest bench — a 2010 change in the state judicial code allows judges to remain on cases even if they have received endorsements or benefited from campaign contributions from parties involved in the case. Building America’s Future is likely pretending to be a group called Progress 2028 in part to hide its connections to Musk, as most voters in the state have negative feelings about the billionaire. Indeed, a Marquette University Law School poll published on Wednesday shows that only 41 percent of Wisconsin residents have a favorable view of Musk, while 53 percent of residents have an unfavorable view of him.
Trump is repeating lies about the crucial anti-poverty program to lay the groundwork for cuts, the senator said. In a scathing response to President Donald Trump’s address to Congress on Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) sharply criticized the president for repeating a widely debunked claim that Social Security checks are going toward deceased people, calling it an “outrageous lie.” During his address, Trump said that there are “shocking levels” of “fraud” within Social Security, claiming that there are millions of Social Security recipients aged between 100 and 360 years old — a completely false assertion circulated by Trump and Elon Musk in recent weeks. “By slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft we can find, we will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families,” Trump said, ignoring the fact that his administration has rapidly ushered in warnings of a “Trumpcession” just a few weeks into his second term. Sanders called out Trump’s lie in a speech delivered after Trump’s address, saying that it’s meant to pave the way for cuts to Social Security — which is the most effective anti-poverty program in the U.S., lifting tens of millions of people above the poverty line each year. “Tonight, Trump claimed that millions of dead people between the ages of 100 and 360 were collecting Social Security checks,” the senator said. “That is an outrageous lie intended to lay the groundwork for cuts to Social Security and dismantling the most successful and popular government program in history.” “Let’s be clear: Well over 99 percent of Social Security checks are going out to people who earned those checks — 70 million people. Nobody who is 150 years old or 200 years old or 300 years old is receiving Social Security checks,” Sanders went on. “And on and on the lies go.” Indeed, only 0.3 percent of Social Security payments are improper, and usually represent miscalculations or errors regarding beneficiaries’ family members. And yet, Trump and Republicans are in the process of enacting sweeping cuts to the program that will affect millions of beneficiaries. The Social Security Administration is eliminating thousands of jobs to align with the Trump administration’s and Elon Musk’s demands to slash federal agencies. A former head of the agency, Martin O’Malley, has said that the cuts, as well as Musk’s interruptions to critical administrative services, mean that the system will “collapse” and that checks could stop going out to recipients within the next one to three months. Meanwhile, the Republican Study Committee — which represents the vast majority of congressional Republicans — has called for massive cuts to the program, which would gut benefits for hundreds of millions of people across the country. Republicans have also proposed cuts to Medicaid and other crucial social programs in their latest budget proposal. Sanders, instead, has proposed expanding Social Security. The senator introduced a bill last week that would increase Social Security benefits by $2,400 a year and fully fund the program for the next 75 years. It would achieve this by “scrapping the cap” on the Social Security payroll tax, which currently does not apply to income earned above $168,000 — meaning that those with higher incomes do not pay into Social Security in every paycheck. People with incomes of $1 million, for instance, stopped paying into Social Security by March 2 this year. “No, we’re not going to cut Social Security,” he said. “Quite the contrary. We must expand Social Security benefits and extend its solvency for the next 75 years by scrapping the cap that allows a billionaire to pay the same amount into Social Security as a truck driver. Too many — too many of our seniors are hurting today to be cutting Social Security. Over 20 percent of seniors in this country living on $15,000 a year or less.” Sanders also called out Trump for rapidly plunging the country into oligarchy, standing in lockstep with Musk and other tech billionaires who contributed tens of millions to get Trump elected to gut the government. He ended his speech with a call for the American people to rise up and oppose Trump’s rule. “Let us never forget. Real change only occurs when ordinary people stand up against oppression and injustice — and fight back,” he said. “Yes, the oligarchs are enormously powerful. They have endless amounts of money. They control our economy. They own much of the media. They have enormous influence over our political system. But, from the bottom of my heart, I am convinced that they can be beaten.”
In his speech to Congress, Trump doubled down on the tariffs that economists say may trigger another Great Depression. On Tuesday evening, hours after the Dow Jones stock index had closed — falling several hundred points for the second day straight in response to the U.S. imposing high tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China — Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress and declared a new “golden age of America.” In two days, global stock markets have shed trillions of dollars in value, far more than the U.S. could ever possibly hope to reap through tariffs. Trump being Trump, he doubled down on an action that threatens to wreak havoc on the global economy, to send the market into a tailspin — and to dramatically raise unemployment across the three countries of North America. Come April 2, he announced, the U.S. will impose what he called “reciprocal tariffs” on countries around the world , thus likely setting off a cascading chain of negative market reactions and escalating tariff battles around the world. Trump singled out for mention the countries of the European Union, South Korea, India, and several others. And, while he acknowledged there might be economic pain, he made light of that and essentially told farmers, who stand to be hit particularly hard by the tariff wars, to simply buckle up and enjoy the bumpy ride. Let’s see how those farmers, most of them Trump voters ( upward of three-quarters of voters in farming counties went for Trump in 2024 ) appreciate that advice. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal has reported the deputy secretary-general of the International Chamber of Commerce as saying “this could be the start of a downward spiral that puts us in 1930s trade-war territory,” warning that Trump’s tariffs on imports could trigger a Great Depression-magnitude crash. GOP members of Congress responded to Trump’s inane claims about the economy by leaping to their feet and chanting, “USA, USA” and “Trump, Trump, Trump,” ignoring the fact that banking, the auto industry and high-tech stock have all been particularly hammered this week. Democrats sat stony-faced. The speech, a State of the Union in all but name, ran long , as Trump’s speeches have a tendency to do. For nearly two hours, the MAGA man blasted forth a mélange of outright lies, distortions based around kernels of truth, irrelevant anecdotes and shameless insults. He also went off on a truly cringeworthy self-pity party, repeatedly lambasting the Democrats — most of whom were sitting silently in the chamber and holding up placards with such phrases as “false” and “save Medicaid” — for being unwilling to applaud him. Trump’s a showman. He may whine like a damaged kitten, but he also knows when to be faux-generous; witness his call-out to the 13-year-old cancer survivor who had always wanted to be a cop, and whom Trump appointed, live on camera, as a Secret Service special agent; or his equally theatrical announcement to a young man in uniform that his dream of getting into West Point had come true and he had been accepted. Both youths went wide-eyed with excitement, thus furthering the narrative of Trump as the beneficent strongman. But cut out the reality TV antics, and what was left was a combination of recycled GOP tropes dating back to the Reagan era, and to Barry Goldwater before him — government is bad; the Panama Canal should belong to the U.S. again; oil is good; taxes are horrible; rich people are good, poor people are bad — layered with a veneer of Trump-patented, Gov. George Wallace-influenced, bigotries and imperial braggadocio. Trump’s tariffs and imports could trigger a Great Depression-magnitude crash. In those nearly two hours, the president repeatedly smeared undocumented immigrants as “criminals” and “savages.” He implied Democrats are weak on crime, whereas Republicans want to empower the police to be not just tough on crime, but also deliberately rough on law-breakers (excepting, of course, the ones from January 6, 2021). He asserted that transgender Americans must be rooted out of every institution, from women’s sports to the U.S. military, snarling: “Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It’s gone — and we feel so much better for it.” In Trump’s telling, Elon Musk ( fascist salutes notwithstanding ) is a true American hero for rooting out vast nests of corruption in USAID. No mention, of course, of the defunding of polio vaccination efforts, TB treatments globally, or HIV drugs that millions of African patients rely on. No mention, either, of the cessation of campaigns to control malaria and Ebola outbreaks, or of the millions of people he put at risk of dying of starvation because of the abrupt end to U.S. anti-hunger programs. (You know things are egregious in this arena when even a Supreme Court as conservative as this one decides, as it did this morning, that the Trump administration has overstepped its bounds by refusing to honor USAID contracts for work already completed.) Trump also repeated Musk’s tired canard that many millions of Social Security recipients are decades older than 100, including some who are over 160. In reality, the Social Security Administration uses an old computing program, COBOL , which does not have a built-in default date but might interpret 75 as 1875 instead of 1975, due to incorrect coding or legacy data handling practices. Had Musk spent a bit more time thinking before talking, he would likely have realized that what his hacker-squad has uncovered isn’t fraud on an epic scale, it’s simply the programming kinks of a six-decade-old computer program. But Musk, like Trump, seems never keen to parse his statements for accuracy. Say it enough times and the most flagrant lie eventually acquires a patina of reality. Some other tidbits from the speech: Trump really, really wants to grab Greenland for the United States. “We need it … for international world security,” he claimed. “And … one way or the other, we’re going to get it.” Greenland’s prime minister has already rejected Trump’s imperial ambitions. His plan, of course, will also be unwelcome news to the European Union, which has pledged to protect the borders of its members — a group that includes Denmark, a NATO member which governs Greenland. Trump also really, really doesn’t like Ukrainians, arguing that the military assistance they have secured from the U.S. in recent years is “like taking candy from a baby.” He’s none too fond of the European Union, which he accused of exploiting the U.S. on tariffs and of continuing to buy vast amounts of Russian oil and gas, even while the U.S. was spending money to arm Ukraine in its fight. But he does have rather a soft spot for Russia, whose leaders he said had sent his team “strong signals that they are ready for peace. Wouldn’t that be beautiful?” Arguably, though, the biggest takeaway of the night was just how messianic Trump has become. Jaw-droppingly, he asserted that the opening month of his presidency was more successful than that of George Washington . Later, as his lengthy oration dragged to a conclusion, he announced that during the assassination attempt against him in July, he “was saved by God to make America great again.” He continued: “It’s our turn to take America’s destiny into our own hands. … This will be our greatest era; with God’s help over the next four years.” He built to a Musk-ian crescendo: “We are going to … plant the American flag on the planet Mars, and even far beyond. … My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden age of America has only just begun.” Trump’s vision is, of course, a fever dream, tinted with the hues of a superhero cartoon narrative. In six weeks, Trump has frayed many of the U.S.’s closest alliances; has, to the mystification of those allies, reoriented the country toward Russia and North Korea in its United Nations votes; has poisoned the well of friendship with the U.S.’s neighbors to the north and south; and has eviscerated the livelihoods of many tens of thousands of hard-working public servants. Trump’s tariff wars will hurt U.S. consumers and many U.S. companies. And the damage to stock portfolios caused by his policies will hit the retirement accounts of tens of millions of elderly Americans and middle-aged Americans hoping to be able to save up for what’s stacking up to be an increasingly insecure future. His assault on anything remotely to do with promoting a cleaner, greener economy will condemn the world to intensifying climate change. The president has failed to instantly reduce inflation, and his tariff policies will almost certainly lead to an acceleration of price increases. And far from growing the economy, federal data suggest a sharp economic contraction this quarter. That combination of economic contraction and inflation is known as stagflation, the dreaded duo that bedeviled western economies in the 1970s. If and when it arrives, ushered in to the GOP’s endless, unthinking chants of “USA, USA,” it will come stamped “Made in America” and “Brought to you by President Donald J. Trump.”
In 2023 alone, $3.9 trillion was sapped from the bottom 90 percent — enough to give every worker a $32,000 raise. A new analysis has found that nearly $80 trillion in wealth has been redistributed from the bottom 90 percent of Americans to the richest 1 percent over the past 50 years, as neoliberal policies have come to roost and billionaires are poised to use their vast power to worsen wealth inequality in the coming years. Five years ago, researchers for RAND found that roughly $47 trillion earned by the working class between 1975 and 2018 was instead given to the richest 1 percent, in 2018 dollars. This calculation was based on calculations of the growth of the bottom 90 percent in the decades after World War II, when income distribution held steady between groups. In a new analysis published last month by RAND extending the analysis to 2023, RAND found that that figure is now $79 trillion in 2023 dollars, with inflation accounting for roughly $10 trillion of the growth. In 2023 alone, $3.9 trillion was redistributed from the bottom 90 percent to the top 1 percent — enough to give every worker a raise of $32,000 per year, per the office of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), who highlighted the new analysis in a release this week. The massive growth in the wealth gap has been fueled by the steadily falling share of economic growth going to the working class since the 1970s, amid the rise of neoliberalism as ushered in in large part by Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. In 1975, RAND found in its most recent report, the bottom 90 percent of Americans received about two-thirds of all taxable income in the U.S. That share dropped to 47 percent by 2019, with over half of income going instead to the top 10 percent. If rates of income growth had remained equitable from the rates prior to the 1970s, the median household income today would be double what it is now, the analysis found. “The massive income and wealth inequality in America today is not only morally unjust, it is profoundly damaging to our democracy,” Sanders said in a statement on Tuesday. Sanders’s statement comes as the Trump administration — including the richest man in the world, Elon Musk — seeks to even further widen the wealth gap with recently proposed tax policies and massive cuts to crucial anti-poverty programs like Social Security and Medicare. “Given this reality, we cannot provide another $1.1 trillion tax break to the top 1 percent by making massive cuts to healthcare, housing, education and nutrition assistance as President Trump and Republicans in Congress want to do,” Sanders said. “We must do the exact opposite.” Indeed, analyses show that Trump’s policies are set to widen the wealth gap even further. According to a recent analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, President Donald Trump’s tax proposals, like the extension of Republicans’ 2017 tax cuts and reducing the corporate tax rate, would provide $36,320 yearly in tax savings to the richest 1 percent, or people with incomes of over $914,900 a year. Meanwhile, the bottom 95 percent of Americans would see a tax increase.
Musk pushed the repeatedly debunked claim that Social Security was making payments to “dead people.” Tech billionaire Elon Musk, head of the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), purported on Friday that Social Security is a “Ponzi scheme” — a false claim that is likely an attempt to lay the groundwork for DOGE to target the highly popular agency for mass spending cuts. Musk made the comments on Friday in an appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” — a podcast with a long history of allowing guests to peddle disinformation without pushback. “We found just with a basic search of the Social Security database that there were 20 million dead people marked as alive. Some of them are getting money,” Musk told host Joe Rogan, parroting a long-debunked Republican talking point. The claim was most recently debunked by Trump-appointed acting Social Security Commissioner, Lee Dudek. “People in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record…are not necessarily receiving benefits,” Dudek said in February. Indeed, Musk’s comments reveal his unfamiliarity with how systems within the Social Security Administration (SSA) work — when the system is unsure about a certain date, for example, it defaults to the year 1875. And despite Musk’s claims that dead people are still receiving benefits, recipients are automatically disenrolled after age 115 as a failsafe to prevent that from happening. Democratic lawmakers in Congress blasted Musk’s comments, particularly his claims that Social Security is a “pyramid scheme” and a “Ponzi scheme.” “You don’t need to scratch your head and wonder what’s going on when you see that the Trump administration is decimating Social Security offices and staff,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) said in a statement . “And you don’t need to ponder what might happen next when Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, says that the tens-of-millions of seniors, families, and children who depend on these earned benefits are part of some scam — because that’s a real threat and a real promise: they are coming for your Social Security.” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) also criticized Musk’s statements on the podcast, pointing out that the tech billionaire was spreading lies about Social Security while receiving lucrative federal contracts. Musk “is a leech on the public,” Ocasio-Cortez said on X . “No matter how many billions he gets in tax cuts and government contracts, it will never be enough for him.” “Now he’s going after the elderly, the disabled, and orphaned children so he can pocket it in tax cuts for himself. It’s disgusting,” she added. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) condemned Musk’s comments in an appearance on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” program on Sunday. “I think what Musk, the wealthiest guy in the world, just said is totally outrageous. It’s a hell of a ‘Ponzi scheme’ when for the last 80 years Social Security has paid out every nickel owed to every eligible American,” Sanders said .
Several videos of Republican lawmakers being confronted by angry voters have gone viral online. Following a series of town hall events where angry voters have gone viral for challenging Republican lawmakers, Republicans are moving their town hall events online, where they can pre-select questions — and many are backing away from these events altogether. In a CNN interview with host Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday evening, Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (Louisiana) baselessly claimed that constituents upset with moves by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk are “paid actors.” Since Trump’s inauguration, voters at town halls across the country have been expressing their opposition to the president’s “tyranny in the White House,” citing the newly-formed “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) that has been illegally ripping through the federal government , shutting down entire agencies and purging workers en masse. Voters have also protested potential cuts to social safety net programs , including Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. Rather than address these concerns, however, Johnson scoffed at them. “The videos you saw of the town halls were of paid protesters in many of those places,” Johnson said , citing no evidence whatsoever. “These are Democrats who went to the events early and filled up the seats.” When Collins suggested that not “all” of the attendees were “paid protesters,” Johnson responded , “Many of them were.” He then conceded slightly, saying, “I don’t know.” Collins noted that one House Republican who was confronted at a town hall recognized the angry attendees as “his constituents.” “One Republican acknowledged they were constituents. That’s fantastic,” Johnson responded sarcastically, before adding: “They had Democrats come and fill the seats early, all right?” After the segment ended, Collins reminded her viewers that Republican lawmakers “also represent Democrats” in their districts. “That doesn’t mean they were paid to show up if they’re upset about this,” she added. After confrontations between Republicans and their constituents have gone viral, Republicans have been avoiding town halls, including events where they would typically be well received. Two Republican members of Congress, Reps. Tom Tiffany and Derrick Van Orden, recently skipped an event hosted by the Wisconsin Farmers Union in the western part of the state . Holy crap. At his town hall last night, Rep. Rich McCormick compared *his own constituents* who asked him tough and fair questions to January 6 insurrectionists pic.twitter.com/lQxMa7Vx1Z Party leaders have discouraged Republicans from hosting town hall events in the near future, saying that if they must host such an event, they should reduce the likelihood of videos being posted on social media by using tele-town hall formats , which allow lawmakers to pre-select questions and ensure that there are no follow-ups. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) hosted one such event on Thursday , responding to a complaint by a constituent about Musk’s sway over the federal government by heaping praise on the billionaire. Musk is “probably one of the most brilliant, accomplished, effective human beings that have ever walked on planet earth,” Johnson said during the meeting, adding that he believed “Elon is doing a fabulous job.” The Democratic Party has condemned Republicans for capitulating to Trump and Musk at every turn. “If Republicans had a spine, they would stand up against Trump’s disastrous agenda and put their constituents first. Instead, after hearing Americans’ fury last week, Republicans intend to silence the people who sent them to Washington as they bend the knee to Donald Trump and Elon Musk,” a blog post from the party stated .
The companies are accused of ripping off savings account holders, illegally collecting on student loans, and more. Consumer advocates on Thursday slammed the Trump administration for dropping various enforcement actions against companies accused of activities that include ripping off savings account holders, illegally collecting on student loans, and engaging in an unlawful mortgage broker kickback scheme. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s notices of voluntary dismissal came as the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs held a hearing for Jonathan McKernan, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the CFPB — which Accountable.US executive director Tony Carrk has called “a gift to big banks and special interests.” While the former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation board member awaits confirmation from the GOP-controlled Senate, Trump and Russell Vought, the CFPB’s temporary leader, have wasted no time trying to gut the agency and undo the work of its former director, Rohit Chopra , who oversaw cases against the following companies: Court paperwork “in the Rocket Homes case notes that the ‘Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dismisses this action, with prejudice, against all defendants,'” according to The Associated Press . “Dismissing a case without prejudice means that it cannot be refiled. Similar wording was used in the dismissals of the CFPB’s Capital One and Vanderbilt Mortgage suits.” Those decisions came after the CFPB last week dropped a case against SoLo Funds, which the agency accused of misleading borrowers about loan costs. Vought had then teased further action, saying on social media Sunday that “shockingly, the CFPB tried to destroy this company, SoLo, which incurred millions in legal fees and had to lay off 30% of its workforce. It was wrong and we dismissed the case. More to come but the weaponization of ‘consumer protection’ must end.” Meanwhile, critics like Christine Chen Zinner, consumer policy counsel at Americans for Financial Reform, are framing the CFPB’s dismissals as a betrayal of the agency’s mission. “The old CFPB stood ready to protect consumers and wrestle back the ill-gotten gains of big banks like Capital One,” Chen Zinner said Thursday. “With this decision, the Trump-appointed leadership is letting Capital One steal $2 billion from its depositors, another example of this administration standing up for Wall Street at the expense of everyday people who deserve the CFPB’s protection.” The CFPB just let Capital One off the hook for cheating consumers out of $2 billion. Dismissing this case is a gift to one of the biggest banks in the country. The CFPB must hold corporate lawbreakers accountable — not side with them over consumers Erin Witte, director of consumer protection at the Consumer Federation of America, also released a statement focused on the bank case. “The CFPB was created to be a watchdog for big banks, not a lapdog, and dismissing this case is a gift to Capital One,” said Witte. “$2 billion is a drop in the bucket for Capital One — less than half a percent of its total assets — but returning this money would make a huge difference to the hardworking Americans who trusted Capital One to safeguard their savings and were kept in the dark about how to earn more.” Witte also described the full list of dismissals as “unprecedented,” and told Reuters , “We’re getting a very strong message here that if you’re a bank, if you’re a student loan servicer, and you’re violating the law, the CFPB is not only not going to pursue you, they’re going to let you out of your case scot-free.” Accountable.US highlighted that “the news stands in stark and alarming contrast to McKernan’s remarks … to senators, promising to review all existing CFPB lawsuits before making any decisions around dropping litigation.” Student Borrower Protection Center executive director Mike Pierce said in a statement about the PHEAA case that “Russ Vought and Donald Trump sided with a lawless and corrupt student loan company at the expense of borrowers across the country — another sign that powerful financial interests are driving the capture and demolition of the federal consumer watchdog.” “This is a slap in the face to students, student loan borrowers, and working people everywhere,” Pierce continued. “PHEAA lied to some of the poorest and most vulnerable Americans, then illegally hounded them for debt that they did not owe, all to make a buck. And today, cowardly political sycophants backed down on the federal government’s only effort to hold PHEAA accountable.” “Of course, like all fascist toadies, Russ Vought will rightly be forgotten by history and sink into well-deserved irrelevance. But until then, law enforcement at every level of government must rush in to fill the void left by a federal consumer protection agency that now stands only to serve billionaires and big corporations,” he added. “Remember: these people prey on those in need because they are motivated only by the desire to exercise power, and they are motivated to do so because they are cowards. It is everyone’s job to remind Vought and his cronies of their powers’ limits, and to remind the world of their cowardice.” With 5 CFPB case dismissals so far today, flagging that @Public_Citizen 's enforcement tracker now includes 400+ cases against 350+ corporations at risk of being dropped or weakened in the Trump/Musk/Vought/DOGE deregulatory bloodbath. (Link in next post.) pic.twitter.com/icA6Mnddeq Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, also directed some blame at billionaire Elon Musk , the head of Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency , which is leading the administration’s efforts to slash the federal workforce and spending. “The Trump administration and Elon Musk are showing us exactly what it means not to have ordinary people protected by a strong Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — they are dismissing enforcement cases that sought to return billions to working families harmed by corporations accused of egregious conduct that violated the law,” said Saunders. “On top of the stop-work order and firing of CFPB workers doing their jobs, this sends a dangerous message to corporate America that financial fraud and abuse will go unchecked. We must preserve a strong, independent, and functional CFPB to stand up to corporate bullies.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a former bankruptcy professor, is the mastermind behind the CFPB. She is also the ranking member of the panel which McKernan appeared before on Thursday. The American Prospect executive editor David Dayen reported that the senator informed the nominee about the dismissals during the hearing. “Literally while you’ve been sitting here and you’ve been talking about the importance of following the law, we get the news that the CFPB is dropping lawsuits against companies that are cheating American families, or alleged to be cheating American families,” Warren said. “It seems to me the timing of that announcement is designed to embarrass you and to show exactly who is in charge of this agency right now: Elon Musk and his little band of hackers.”
“If you want to discuss policies in the Department of Labor, let’s bring in the real secretary,” Sanders said. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) is urging Republicans to call on Elon Musk to testify before the Senate labor committee in order to probe who in the Trump administration is truly in charge, as the Senate continues advancing cabinet picks in spite of Musk seemingly being behind most major decisions. In remarks on the nomination of President Donald Trump’s labor secretary pick, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, in the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Sanders said that he opposes Chavez-DeRemer’s nomination — but that it hardly matters who is in the cabinet with Musk at large. The labor secretary should be someone who protects workers’ rights and the interests of working people, with tens of millions workers subject to “starvation wages” and an increasingly huge gulf between the rich and the working class, Sanders said. And yet, the person making decisions related to labor and other issues facing working people is instead the richest person on earth, he said. “The most important point of this hearing is, let me be very clear: Today, we are not voting on who the next Secretary of Labor is. The next Secretary of Labor, the next Secretary of Education, the next Secretary of Housing, the next Secretary of the Treasury is Elon Musk. And let us understand that reality and not play along with this charade,” Sanders said. “Does anyone here really think that any Secretary of Labor, any Secretary of Education, is going to make decisions by himself or herself?” he asked. Indeed, as the senator pointed out, Musk held an outsized presence at Trump’s first cabinet meeting of his second term on Wednesday. Musk is not a cabinet-level official — in fact, his title as a special government employee means that he is only supposed to work for 130 days in a calendar year and underwent less vetting than normal federal employees. And yet, Musk spoke more than any of the official cabinet members, and when he was not speaking, Trump often referred to him as someone advising him on major decisions like laying off a million federal workers. At one point, Trump said: “Is anybody unhappy with Elon?” Trump asked. “If you are, we’ll throw them out of here.” “Let’s be honest. The American people understand it, and it’s time that we understood it as well. If you want to discuss policies in the Department of Labor, let’s bring in the real secretary,” Sanders said. “Mr. Chairman, I respectfully request that this committee bring Elon Musk before this committee so that we can really hear what’s going on with the government.” The committee ultimately voted 14 to 9 to advance Chavez-DeRemer’s nomination, with three Democrats joining Republicans in voting in her favor. Sanders voted “no.” Labor advocates have noted that, while Chavez-DeRemer was one of the few Republicans to support the pro-union Protecting the Right to Organize Act when she was a House member, she also falls in line with Republicans’ anti-worker views — supporting anti-union “right to work” laws. Musk, meanwhile, wants to shut down federal labor regulation entirely. After years of his companies being investigated by labor regulators for numerous alleged labor violations, Musk’s SpaceX filed a lawsuit last year attempting to shutter the National Labor Relations Board, the country’s top labor regulator.
“He sends one tweet, and all of a sudden, everyone backs off,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) slammed the GOP for blocking potentially lifesaving reforms to the pharmaceutical industry in a powerful speech on Wednesday, highlighting the vast power that unelected and increasingly unpopular billionaire Elon Musk has over the party. In a hearing in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce advocating for reforms on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), Ocasio-Cortez pointed out that such proposals could have already been signed into law if Republicans hadn’t capitulated to Musk’s intervention online last year. “Republicans are in support, Democrats are in support — so what happened? Well, on December 15th, at 4:15 in the morning, Elon Musk began firing off a barrage of social media posts opposing pharmacy benefit manager reform,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “All of a sudden, this bill that had almost unanimous support fell apart in a matter of hours,” she went on. “We had nearly 435 members on board with it — he sends one tweet, and all of a sudden, everyone backs off. And it kills drug pricing reform that would save people money on their insulin, on their asthma inhalers — everything that they need.” Patient advocates have long called for PBMs to be reined in over opaque practices that create yet more roadblocks for patients within the already complex and corporate health care system. Reforms proposed in Congress last year, a result of years of negotiations , would have limited the power of PBMs, widely regarded as middlemen in the pharmaceutical industry who have been scrutinized by federal regulators for their role in artificially inflating the costs of drug prices for patients and helping to kill small pharmacies across the country. Indeed, language to reform PBMs was originally included in Congress’s budget bill in December. But GOP leadership dropped the proposal from the legislation after Musk complained about the resolution being too long, with too much “pork” — a move critics said was a capitulation to the pharmaceutical industry. Worse, after the language was dropped, Musk said he didn’t even know what a PBM is, Ocasio-Cortez pointed out. “And then, to kick it off, five days after he kills pharmacy benefit manager reform, we get this tweet from Elon Musk: ‘What is a “pharmacy benefit manager?”’” said the lawmaker. “The problem here isn’t a substance issue, it’s not a process issue — it’s an oligarchy issue,” Ocasio-Cortez went on. “Whether you’re a Democrat or you’re a Republican, everyone here was elected to be accountable to the people of the United States — not to be governed by tweet, but to be governed by their duly elected representation.” The lawmaker said that Republicans should reject Musk’s influence to pass these reforms. “So I would love a commitment from our Republican counterparts, who we agree with on this issue, to just put it on the floor. And let us vote for it,” she said. “And we can actually get a result for the American people by booting this guy out from political influence.”
The poll also showed support from a significant segment of Americans for reducing or eliminating DOGE. A new poll shows that a majority of Americans are concerned about tech billionaire Elon Musk’s clear conflicts of interest as head of the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), which has been ripping through federal agencies and purging government employees en masse. In the latest Economist /YouGov poll , conducted February 23-25, respondents were asked whether they were concerned that Musk was using DOGE to benefit himself and his companies. Only 30 percent said they were not too concerned or not concerned at all, while nearly 6 in 10 Americans (57 percent) said they were somewhat or very concerned. Notably, Musk is listed as a “special government employee” — a designation that legally requires him to avoid any conflicts of interest relating to his governmental work, including actions that may affect his income, his companies or any agencies that regulate them. But Musk has been flouting those rules, firing workers at agencies that directly impact how his companies are regulated . Because of DOGE, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is planning to cut 10 percent of its workforce, including employees overseeing the safety of autonomous vehicles — which Musk’s motor vehicle company Tesla is pursuing. (Prior to this year, Tesla’s autonomous vehicles were being investigated by the federal government over various crashes.) Workers at the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) office that oversees neurological and physical medicine were also cut, a move that directly benefits Musk’s brain chip startup Neuralink. Those examples are just the tip of the iceberg , as DOGE has been targeting nearly a dozen agencies that have had investigations into or regulatory battles with Musk’s companies — including the Interior Department, the Justice Department, the National Labor Relations Board, and more. The Economist /YouGov poll also found significant support for reducing DOGE’s work, with 37 percent in favor of a reduction or complete elimination of the likely illegally formed agency . Twenty-seven percent said they want the agency kept the same, while 21 percent said they want it to be expanded, amounting to 48 percent total expressing some level of support for DOGE. Still, poll respondents had far higher levels of support for agencies being slashed by DOGE than for DOGE itself — for example, 28 percent of respondents in the poll said they want the National Park Service (NPS) to be expanded. Only 11 percent said they wanted that agency reduced or eliminated, a 26-point difference between NPS and DOGE. Nearly half (47 percent) said they wanted NPS kept the same — a 20-point difference between NPS and DOGE. Near the time of President Donald Trump’s inauguration, public opinion on Musk was split, with 46 percent saying they had a favorable view of the billionaire while 46 percent said they did not. But just one month into the Trump administration and Musk’s gutting of federal agencies, that rating has diminished , with just 43 percent saying they have a favorable view of Musk and 50 percent saying they have an unfavorable view.
Leland Dudek instructed managers earlier this week to draw up plans for a 50 percent cut to the agency’s workforce. The acting leader of the Social Security Administration reportedly instructed managers earlier this week to draw up plans for a 50% cut to the agency’s workforce, a push that advocates and lawmakers said would result in the gutting or total closure of local field offices — and likely benefit disruptions. The American Prospect first reported the request from Leland Dudek, whom Trump installed as SSA commissioner earlier this month after the agency’s former head resigned following a clash with Elon Musk’s deputies over their attempts to access highly sensitive personal data. At the time he was elevated to the helm of SSA, Dudek was under investigation for allegedly sharing information with Musk’s team improperly. According to the Prospect , the deadline for SSA managers to comply with Dudek’s request for mass-firing plans was Wednesday afternoon. “The decision could target one of the government’s most prominent public-facing initiatives: SSA field offices, where seniors, people with disabilities, and survivors whose parents have died can sign up for benefits and get information,” the outlet noted. “In an email to the Prospect , SSA would not confirm any reductions in its workforce beyond the abolition of two small internal offices announced this week… Sources have speculated to the Prospect that the terminations are being done piecemeal to avoid headlines of tens of thousands of jobs lost.” Nancy Altman, president of the progressive advocacy group Social Security Works , said in a statement Wednesday that Dudek’s push for large-scale staff cuts shows the Trump administration and Elon Musk want to “demolish” SSA. “Contrary to what Elon Musk and his acolytes may believe, AI chatbots are no substitute for in-person service from a human being,” said Altman. “Americans apply for Social Security benefits at the most vulnerable times of their lives. Moreover, many people who seek information may have trouble articulating or even knowing what questions they need to ask.” “If Musk’s plan goes through, it will deny many Americans access to their hard-earned Social Security benefits. Field offices around the country will close. Wait times for the 1-800 number will soar,” Altman warned. “ DOGE claims to be concerned about fraud, but the best way to detect fraud is through face-to-face contacts with humans who can detect suspicious responses and can read body language. It’s not too late to stop this disaster. We urge everyone to call their members of Congress and tell them that local Social Security offices must stay open and fully staffed.” In the wake of the Prospect ’s story, Government Executive reported that five of the eight regional SSA commissioners “whose offices oversee and support the agency’s frontline offices across the country” have decided to leave their posts at the end of this week amid the Trump administration’s onslaught against the federal workforce . “Their departures come amid rumors of impending staff cuts at SSA, where the workforce is already at a 50-year low and has toiled amid a customer service crisis born of lack of funding,” Government Executive noted. “Decades of congressional neglect have seen the agency’s administrative budget, which for decades sat at 1.2% of benefit outlays, shrink to under 1%.” The outlet added that “regional commissioners aren’t the only ones leaving SSA. An unknown number of other employees are also leaving the agency, which shuttered its civil rights and transformation offices this week.” Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor who served as SSA commissioner under the Biden administration, wrote late Wednesday that “Social Security is being driven to a total system collapse.” “I give the DOGE kids and co-President Musk 30-90 days before they crater it to the point of interruption of benefits,” O’Malley added. Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), a champion of Social Security and vocal supporter of expanding benefits, said in a statement that “ Donald Trump pledged no cuts to Social Security on the campaign trail, but now he and Elon Musk have plans to do exactly that.” “Let me be clear — laying off half of the workforce at the Social Security Administration and shuttering field offices will mean the delay, disruption, and denial of benefits,” said Larson. “This is nothing more than a backdoor benefit cut and an insult to Americans who have paid into the system and earned their Social Security — all to pay for trillions in new tax cuts for the wealthy. This has nothing to do with ‘governmental efficiency.'”
DOGE has put at risk basic government function, dramatically increasing the riskiness of daily life for all Americans. As the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) continues its rampage through government — so perfectly epitomized by Elon Musk’s ghastly dance with a chainsaw gifted to him by Argentina’s austerity-obsessed President Javier Milei at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week — one basic public safety agency after the next is being compromised. Anyone concerned about the threat of nuclear weapons can see that firing the personnel of the Nuclear Security Administration , the highly trained crew responsible for maintaining the safety and security of the country’s nuclear weapons stockpile, is a terrible idea. Except the boy-geniuses at DOGE somehow couldn’t work that out, and mistakenly fired the core of the country’s nuclear safety system. Similarly, with bird flu looming as the next great pandemic threat, now seems hardly the time to fire the USDA people responsible for monitoring the spread of the disease — as, again, was done, again allegedly by mistake, during the great culling of government employees. In both instances, the government set about trying to rehire the experts only to realize that, because the laid-off employees had been instantly locked out of their government email accounts, they were hard to find. Whodathunkit?! While most were subsequently rehired, the episodes should serve as a massive canary in the coal mine warning of the dangers of the ill thought out decimation of government currently underway. At the most basic level, summarily dismissing people with unique expertise in areas of critical public safety leaves a vast hole in the nation’s readiness to prevent, or to deal with, catastrophe. But the dangers go far beyond that: When people with highly specialized skills are treated as badly as those who have been summarily dismissed during the purge have been, when the government welches on paying wages and benefits, when it goes out of its way to humiliate the employees it seeks to dismiss — including by conjuring up nebulous “poor performance” reviews to justify termination — the government is essentially giving these people an incentive to instead sell their expertise to the highest bidder. The U.S. isn’t a financially bankrupt state in the way that Russia was immediately following the fall of the Soviet Union, but for some unfathomable reason, the Musk-Trump duo is making their decisions about dismantling our government at speed on the premise that it is. In an alarmist mood, one might also fear other parallels with what happened after the Soviet Union imploded in 1991: Huge numbers of highly skilled operatives, experts in bioweapons, in nuclear weapons, and so on, were suddenly left out in the cold by their own government. In the years that followed, many were snapped up by mercenary groups, arms smugglers, and other governments . And even if it’s unlikely that current U.S. federal workers will go running to support smugglers and other governments, the destruction of large parts of the federal system of government will still have vastly negative impacts. In the best-case scenario, these federal workers will likely move on to the private sector, if they find jobs at all. This potential transfer of skills and resources away from the federal government — and the public good — toward companies motivated entirely by their bottom line should concern us all. What would it mean for information about the spread of disease to end up behind a paywall, to be accessed only by the wealthy? This is the future the Trump administration likely envisions in encouraging federal employees to resign. In fact, its very own FAQ sheet on the “deferred resignation” period openly says : “The way to greater American prosperity is encouraging people to move from lower productivity jobs in the public sector to higher productivity jobs in the private sector.” This is why, rather than taking the time to carefully audit programs for waste, and to scale back the workforce of bloated programs in the wake of those audits, they have ordered what is essentially a squad of highly skilled young computer hackers into action. Many of these young men have long social media tails of racist, homophobic and sexist comments . They also have no knowledge of how government works. Yet, unfathomably, they have been empowered to go into federal departments, to take over their computer systems, and to then draw up lists of employees who can be summarily fired, all in the name of government efficiency and of dismantling anything remotely connected to diversity, equity and inclusion. The declared aim is, simply, to reduce the federal workforce by 10 percent — reminiscent of the way Roman generals wielded decimation on their legions, some of whose members had committed crimes such as desertion or mutiny, by randomly killing 1 in 10 of all the soldiers in the unit as a collective punishment, and, presumably, a macabre encouragement to their fellow legionnaires to make sure to root out potential future mutineers or deserters — no matter the cost or collateral damage. The sheer offense of handing the inner workings of government to Elon Musk and an anonymous group of young computer engineers becomes obvious when one looks at who is being fired. The Federal Aviation Administration has long been understaffed, and has had several fatal air crashes on its watch in recent weeks, including a mid-air collision in Washington, D.C. Those understaffing problems have now been exacerbated by the decision to fire an additional 400 workers. The union representing them reported that these included aviation safety assistants, maintenance mechanics and some of the people responsible for updating the digital maps used by pilots in flight. Two hundred Food and Drug Administration workers who monitored the safety of medical devices were laid off — although after a public outcry some were rehired. Meanwhile, so many people from the agency’s food safety division, with expertise on everything from unsafe chemicals in the food supply to the safety of baby formula, have been terminated that the head of that division resigned, saying it was pointless to continue given the lack of staff. The list goes on and on. Firings have rocked FEMA , NOAA , the Forest Service , which is a vital part of the country’s wildfire-fighting infrastructure, the 9/11 first responder program , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the National Institutes of Health , the Department of Veterans Affairs , and countless other agencies that help deliver everything from mental health services to school lunches. If an adversary wanted to devise a way to weaken the United States, I doubt they could have come up with a more effective methodology than that being unleashed on the U.S. by the Trump administration and the DOGE shadow government. Without any due process, contemptuous of the mechanisms that Congress has set up to regulate hiring and firing within the civil service, and absent public hearings or congressional debate, DOGE has put at risk basic government function. In doing so, it has dramatically increased the riskiness of daily life for all Americans. In the short-term, Trump and Musk may boast about the chainsaw that they are putting to the so-called Deep State. In the long-term, I suspect most Americans will realize the chainsaw has actually been put to mission-critical functions that keep society chugging along without cascading disasters. But by then it might be too late; the experts will have left government service, many will have gone to private industry or to overseas interests, and ordinary Americans will have been rendered more vulnerable to everything from pandemics to malfunctioning medical devices to unsafe food to nuclear accidents. Pardon my obtuseness here, but from where I’m standing, that comes off as quite a bizarre way to make “America Great Again.”
“We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions,” the staffers wrote. A group of staffers has resigned from Elon Musk’s rogue “Department of Government Efficiency” in a joint protest against the billionaire’s coup and indiscriminate slashing of the federal government. In a joint resignation letter reported by The Associated Press , the 21 workers said that they refuse to use their expertise to “compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans’ sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.” “We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE’s actions,” the group wrote. The group is made up of engineers, data scientists and product managers, the AP reported, who formerly held senior roles in major tech companies. They said that the lackeys hired by Musk lack the experience and knowledge that they and other federal bureaucrats fired by DOGE applied to their positions. The staffers were carryovers who worked for the U.S. Digital Service, which Trump reorganized and renamed as “DOGE” in an executive order on his first day in office. Experts have said it’s unclear if DOGE is a formal agency, as major offices and agencies can only be created by Congress, while numerous lawsuits, politicians and experts have said that Musk and the group are acting unlawfully. The White House itself has admitted that Musk “has no actual or formal authority” — even as it allows him to exercise wide authority over the government. In their letter, the former staffers said that people wearing White House visitors’ badges raided the agency to grill the Digital Service employees the day after Trump’s inauguration. The goal seemed to be to disrupt the agency from the start, with the visitors seemingly “guided by ideology and fandom of Musk,” AP reports. “Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,” the letter says. “This process created significant security risks.” The letter goes on to say that, earlier this month, the Trump administration laid off 40 workers from the office, whose mission is to improve and modernize government services. “These highly skilled civil servants were working to modernize Social Security, veterans’ services, tax filing, health care, disaster relief, student aid, and other critical services,” the staffers said. “Their removal endangers millions of Americans who rely on these services every day. The sudden loss of their technology expertise makes critical systems and American’s data less safe.” The resignation is the latest sign of unrest within the federal government as Musk, an unelected official, targets numerous agencies, enacting major cuts to crucial health research , Medicare and Medicaid, and life-saving foreign aid, among many others. Most recently, Musk has attempted to carry out a huge round of layoffs by sending an email to all federal employees demanding that they document their productivity over the past week or be laid off. This has caused some rifts within the administration as heads for the FBI, State Department, and other agencies have told employees to ignore the email.
A civil rights attorney said that the impeachment filing is “naked political retaliation.” On Monday, Republican Rep. Andy Ogles (Tennessee) introduced a resolution to impeach U.S. District Judge John Bates after Bates required federal agencies to restore content removed from websites for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. This impeachment resolution is the third action by Republicans this month against federal judges presiding over challenges to Trump’s executive orders. “The impeachment filing against Judge John Bates is naked political retaliation for his defense of legal procedure regarding trans-related health data,” Khadijah M. Silver, supervising attorney for civil rights at Lawyers for Good Government, told Truthout . Bates, a Bush appointee, ordered a temporary restraining order after agreeing with the plaintiffs that the removal of health-related documents by the Trump administration may have violated the Administrative Procedure Act and, in some cases, the Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires agencies to provide adequate notice before discontinuing “significant information products.” The Hill reported that over 80,000 pages had been removed from more than a dozen government websites in compliance with Trump’s anti-DEI and anti-trans executive orders. “By targeting a judge who simply required agencies to follow the law before removing vital information, Representative Ogles has revealed this administration’s willingness to weaponize impeachment against anyone who stands in the way of their anti-trans agenda,” Silver said. As part of his ruling, Bates ordered the republication of resources on LGBTQ youth, sexual health, contraception, and gender-affirming care, warning that the removal of such content could cause “serious injuries to the public health.” Doctors for America, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, had cautioned that this purge created a “dangerous gap in the scientific data,” which health professionals rely on to track disease outbreaks and provide evidence-based care. The articles of impeachment filed by Ogles claim that Bates’s conduct in the case was “so utterly lacking in intellectual honesty and basic integrity that he is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors.” In a social media post announcing the articles of impeachment, Ogles called Bates a “radical LGBTQ activist.” Elon Musk shared the announcement on X, stating, “Time to impeach judges who violate the law.” “Elon wants to impeach judges for stopping him. This rep. called the judge a predator,” civil rights attorney Alejandra Caraballo said on Bluesky . “They’re spinning up the stochastic terror machine to threaten the judge into submission.” Musk has also called for the impeachment of Biden-appointed U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson after Abelson blocked Trump’s executive orders aimed at ending federal support for DEI programs, and Obama-appointed U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who temporarily blocked Musk’s so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) from accessing Treasury Department payment systems. Last week, Republican lawmakers introduced impeachment articles against Engelmayer — a move that was celebrated by Musk, who accused the judge of being “corrupt.” Musk’s accusation was condemned by the American College of Trial Lawyers, which said that his statement was “groundless and reckless,” and “demeans our system of justice and puts the rule of law at risk.” Impeaching federal judges is very rare and requires a majority vote in the House of Representatives to impeach, followed by a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict and remove the judge from office. The most recent impeachment of a federal judge occurred in 2010, when U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Porteous Jr. of Louisiana was impeached by the House of Representatives, convicted by the Senate, and removed from office for accepting bribes.
Meanwhile, DOGE’s budget has doubled since the start of February, and Trump has spent millions in tax dollars on golf. A new analysis of government contracts cut by the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) shows that, around 40 percent of the time, these cuts haven’t yielded savings for taxpayers at all. The analysis, conducted by The Associated Press and based on data provided by DOGE itself, is further evidence that the Elon Musk-run “department” is misstating its total savings numbers, and misleading the public in the process. According to the analysis , 417 of the 1,125 contracts that are listed as having recently been canceled — a little more than 37 percent of those contracts — account for agreements that have “already been fully obligated.” In other words, the payments on those contracts have already been made, meaning that canceling them won’t result in any savings. Despite this finding, DOGE still claims that those 417 contracts somehow account for nearly half a billion dollars in savings. Charles Tiefer, a retired University of Baltimore law professor who is an expert on government contracting law, explained to The Associated Press that many of the contracts were merely set to expire, and that they wouldn’t have amounted to future spending unless they were renewed. Canceling them now doesn’t create any new savings, he said. “It’s like confiscating used ammunition after it’s been shot when there’s nothing left in it,” Tiefer said. “It doesn’t accomplish any policy objective. Their terminating so many contracts pointlessly obviously doesn’t accomplish anything for saving money.” Despite its purported “efficiency,” DOGE’s own budget appears to be ballooning. From January 30 to February 8, the budget for the “department” more than doubled , going from $6.75 million to $14.44 million. The original budget for DOGE was much smaller, too — at its start, the Trump administration allocated just $750,000 for the project. DOGE doesn’t appear to be scrutinizing its own spending habits — nor those of President Donald Trump. While DOGE continues to scrap various contracts and programs that are in the thousands of dollars, Trump has reportedly spent over $10.7 million in taxpayer funds to play golf . That’s likely a higher rate of taxpayer spending than was seen in the first month of his first term in office, when Trump engaged in six golf outings . In the first month of his second term, Trump has spent at least seven days golfing — around a quarter of the days he’s been in office so far . DOGE has faced widespread criticism for ripping through the federal government, with many constitutional experts pointing out that the “department” may not be legal at all. Notably, DOGE staffers have accessed sensitive computer systems , including the Treasury Department’s payment systems (although staffers are now temporarily suspended from accessing those systems by a court order ). DOGE also intends to access IRS and Social Security data. DOGE has fired or furloughed thousands of federal workers so far, including over 1,000 National Park Service workers . The department has also mistakenly fired workers who were tasked with monitoring nuclear weapons , gutted the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and canceled close to $1 billion in Department of Education contracts. Meanwhile, at least three members of the DOGE team have recently come under fire for their misogynistic, racist and/or white nationalist activity online. One staffer resigned after media uncovered his racist social media posts — but after Vice President J.D. Vance and Trump came to the staffer’s defense, Musk reinstated him to the task force .
Meanwhile, resistance grows to Elon Musk’s demands and threats to the federal workforce. Reporters, workers and now judges across the country are disputing the cost-cutting claims of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has targeted federal employees across multiple sectors with firings, forced resignations and threatened layoffs. One of the millions of Americans being impacted by DOGE’s draconian measures is Latisha, an employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs. She says that Musk’s recent demand ordering federal employees to email a summary of their work from the past week was “insulting” and “disrespectful,” and that “his real goal is to gut public services in the federal workforce and pave the way for privatization of public services, goods and programs that we all need and love.” She outlines how Black Americans and veterans, who are disproportionately represented among the ranks of federal workers, are being particularly affected by these cuts. We also speak to ProPublica editor-in-chief Stephen Engelberg about his recent reporting on a “clearly wrong, clearly disproved” statistic being cited by the Trump administration about the number of federal employees who are working remotely. The statistic is being used to justify the “king-like powers” claimed by Trump and the nepotistic hires at DOGE, says Engelberg. This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: We begin today’s show looking at growing resistance to Elon Musk’s demands and threats to the federal workforce, and how reporters are disputing the cost-cutting claims of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. On Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked DOGE from accessing private information at the Office of Personnel Management and Education Department. Also on Monday, a different federal judge said the way DOGE is operating may be unconstitutional since the the appointments clause of the Constitution requires leaders of federal agencies to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and Elon Musk was neither nominated nor confirmed. This all comes after the Trump-appointed heads of key agencies, including FBI Director Kash Patel, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, all told their workers not to comply with a demand Musk made on Saturday to all 2.3 million federal workers. On his social media platform X, Musk wrote, quote, “Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump’s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation,” unquote. In response, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees called Musk “unelected and unhinged.” Meanwhile, President Trump backed Musk’s plan, calling it a, quote, “pretty ingenious idea,” and said workers who don’t answer would be, quote, “semi-fired or fired,” even as the Office of Personnel Management contradicted him and said responses were voluntary. Elon Musk doubled down on Sunday, writing on X, his social media platform, quote, “A large number of good responses have been received already. These are the people who should be considered for promotion,” unquote. Critics noted a promotion would make them probationary, and Musk has directed federal agencies to fire probationary workers. For more, we’re joined by two guests. Stephen Engelberg is ProPublica ’s editor-in-chief, which has a team of reporters covering Donald Trump’s second presidency. And in Philadelphia, we begin with a federal worker at the Department of Veterans Affairs, where the Trump cuts already led to the dismissal of more than 1,000 newly hired workers, including nurses, doctors and other workers. Latisha is using only her first name for interviews, in part out of fear of reprisal. She’s also a member of the American Federation of Government Employees. We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Latisha, let’s begin with you. You work at the Department of Veterans Affairs. All 2.3 million federal workers have gotten this message they have to say what they did this week, and if they don’t respond, they will be considered resigned — except that a number of different agency heads said you shouldn’t respond to that email. And yet President Trump says it was an “ingenious idea.” Can you explain the kind of chaos in the Veterans Affairs Administration right now? How are federal workers feeling and responding? LATISHA: Good morning, Amy. Thank you so much for having me and for drawing attention to this national fight. I just want to make the disclaimer that things that I share today are my personal views and of my experience, and I am not representing my agency nor my union in any fashion. The email — “What did you do last week?” — it’s insulting. It’s disrespectful to the work that federal workers do every single day. As you mentioned earlier, it caused mass confusion, also concern for privacy and the security of the very sensitive and confidential information federal workers handle every single day. This is a game to DOGE. This is a game to Elon. He has acknowledged that it is a ruse. And federal workers are learning and understanding that this is all a ruse, right? It’s under the guise of efficiency, of accountability, but we know the “rude awakening,” that Elon calls it, or the second dose of reality, which is his real goal, is to gut public services in the federal workforce and pave the way for privatization of public services, goods and programs that we all need and love. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Latisha, the VA is one of the largest agencies in the federal government, about 400,000 employees. What was the communication you got from VA supervisors about — if any, about what you should do in terms of this deadline that Musk imposed? LATISHA: Yes. So, you know, we were at the time — you know, earlier part of the day, before we were then told that we did not have to reply, you know, our union, as well as our agency, did direct us to comply to the request. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And what has been the morale and the — of your fellow employees as you’re facing this contradictory pronouncements and announcements of layoffs, rescinding of layoffs? Could you talk about what the impact is on your day-to-day work? LATISHA: Sure. So, you know, including myself, as well as my colleagues, this is very distressing for us. It’s demoralizing, and it’s dehumanizing. We know what we do for the federal government, for the American public, truly, every single day. Like, the United States Postal Service ensures that mail gets processed and delivered to every home address in the United States of America. The Consumer Protection Bureau ensures that, you know, these corporations are held accountable and making sure that everyday working families are not being scammed. It’s demoralizing. We know that it’s meant to be intimidating, to sow chaos and confusion for the ultimate goal of gutting public services and, you know, paving a way for Elon and his very wealthy, disgustingly wealthy allies to gain more profit. And it’s not right. You know, if Elon is successful, this will impact working families everywhere. In fact, it already is, right? With the loss of jobs, with the mass resignations, there will be, and has already been, perhaps delays in processing of claims at Social Security and Medicare. Delays will come for medical care for veterans. You know, our public lands will not be ready and accessible and safe for the summer and spring seasons. This will continue to have deleterious impacts for many generations to come. And I’m very happy to be a part of a group of informal rank-and-file workers who are fighting back against these austerity measures. AMY GOODMAN: In addition to Latisha, who is a Veterans Affairs federal worker, we’re joined by Stephen Engelberg, who is ProPublica ’s editor-in-chief, which has a team of reporters covering President Trump. In December, Stephen, you wrote ” An Open Letter to Elon Musk ,” in which you suggested his Department of Government Efficiency read the ProPublica reporting on wasteful practices and spending by federal agencies. On Monday, you wrote a piece headlined “The Trump Administration Keeps Citing an Untrue Stat as It Targets Federal Workers.” It begins, “As the administration of President Donald Trump throws one government agency after another into the ‘wood chipper,’ a startling statistic about federal workers keeps coming up: Only 6% of federal employees are working full time in their offices. “By any post-pandemic standard, it’s an astoundingly low number, particularly as major American corporations move to force workers back to the office five days a week. “It’s also completely untrue,” unquote. Stephen Engelberg, talk about why you dug into this one false claim among many, what you found, and how it fits into the bigger picture here, why this is so significant. STEPHEN ENGELBERG: Good morning, Amy. Well, of course, we are hearing an awful lot of things that are untrue — you know, Ukraine attacked Russia, so on. I mentioned in the piece the, you know, rise and fall of the $50 million in condoms to Gaza. So, there are many, many kind of false claims filtering around here. This one caught my eye, because it was a bit of a sort of a kerfuffle in early December. A senator from Idaho, Senator Joni Ernst, who’s been a longtime foe of the federal workforce’s purported wasteful practices, put out a report, and it said 6% of federal workers — only 6% of federal workers show up to work Monday through Friday. And the minute that came out, it was on — it was in the New York Post . You know, Hannity picked it up, Fox News, Speaker Mike Johnson. So, it was everywhere. And, you know, being an investigative type — we at ProPublica do a lot of investigative reporting — I was just curious: Where did this come from? And so, I went to the report. The report had footnotes. And the footnote took me to something that was a story done by Federal News Network, an operation out of Washington that covers the federal workforce. And they had done a sort of completely unscientific survey saying, you know, “Write in if you want to tell us about your work habits.” And so, they got a little over 6,000 people writing in. And by the time that I got to the website, they had put an editor’s note in, saying this is an unscientific survey, everyone is self-selected. There is no possibility that this is actually accurate. In fact, the OMB has done kind of the definitive survey of this, and, first of all, only 50% of federal workers can work remotely at all. So, half the workforce goes to work every day, because, if we think about it, aircraft carriers and veterans’ hospitals and so on. I mean, the doctors can’t work remotely. The nurses can’t work remotely. The 5,000 sailors on an aircraft carrier, they’re not working remotely. So it was obviously wrong. And then, of the remaining 50% of us, they spend about 60% of their time at work. So, this statistic was clearly wrong, clearly disproved. And frankly, I didn’t think it was much of a story, because, you know, there was — you know, the various fact-checking websites came out a few days later, picked up the editor’s note on the story and said, “Look, this is baloney.” PolitiFact said, you know, “pants on fire,” which is the lowest possible rating for truth of a political statement. But then, lo and behold, when Trump took office, this thing started popping up again. On January 20th, it was in Trump’s fact sheet explaining why they’re going to cut the federal workforce. And so, I thought that was worth kind of honing in on and sort of explaining to people. The first iteration of this, the report, might have been a bit of sloppy research, you know, misreading of a story in a footnote by somebody writing a report. But the second iteration of it was not. That was done with malice of forethought. And I thought that was worth stopping and telling people, so that’s why I did the story. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Stephen, I’m wondering if you could talk about the status of DOGE, what exactly it is. One of your articles in ProPublica says, “If DOGE is a federal agency, it can’t shield its records from the public,” which the Trump administration has been doing. But “If it’s not an agency, then DOGE’s tens of millions of dollars in funding weren’t legally allocated and should be returned,” some people are contending. Could you talk about this limbo area that DOGE exists in? STEPHEN ENGELBERG: Yeah, I mean, I think the way they’re handling it is, you know, despite the public statements about transparency, to limit any transparency. You know, as your viewers no doubt noticed, when they were sort of challenged on this, they began putting out some notion of what they’re doing. You know, talk about “tell me five things you did last week.” DOGE began reporting some of the things they’ve done, and said, “Look, we’ve saved $55 billion.” And it turned out it was nowhere near that. So, I think this is designed — you know, you’ll notice they’ve gone round and round on who even runs DOGE. I mean, you know, at one point, obviously, the president said, “I’m appointing Elon Musk to run this thing.” When they began to notice that maybe that might have legal implications, they announced that, no, he’s not running it at all. But they won’t say who is running it. You know, it walks like a duck. It quacks like a duck. It’s a duck. I mean, this is a federal agency. It’s wielding arguably the most power that any federal agency has ever wielded. I mean, when other presidents who were, shall we say, skeptical of the federal workforce became president, the Office of Personnel Management, which runs, is the HR sort of arm of the government, they were not able to fire thousands upon thousands of workers at a stroke. So, I think it’s pretty clear. And I think that, ultimately, this will be concluded that DOGE is a federal agency, and whoever is running it is the leader of an agency, and that’s going to have a lot of implications. AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go to a video that ProPublica and Documented obtained from a 2023 speech by the now, well, director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, who is considered one of the chief architects of Project 2025. He spoke at a private gathering at the pro-Trump think tank Center for Renewing America. Here, Vought is describing his goal of defunding federal bureaucracies. RUSSELL VOUGHT: We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected. We want — when they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are so — they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down, so that the EPA can’t do all of the rules against our energy industry, because they have no bandwidth financially to do so. We want to put them in trauma. AMY GOODMAN: So, Stephen Engelberg, talk about the significance of what Russell Vought, now, once again, head of OMB, said. STEPHEN ENGELBERG: I think it’s incredibly important. I mean, it’s a funny thing. You know, you do a lot of stories in the run-up to an election, and I remember that one fairly vividly. And I thought, you know, that it was chilling, it was important. We played it up a lot. But I also wondered if this was a sort of rhetorical flourish, as these things sometimes are. That is not a rhetorical flourish. You listen to that and you look at what’s happened, and you can see that is the game plan. Whatever they said during the campaign about “2025 is not really what we’re going to do,” I think it’s turning out it is exactly what they’re going to do. And in particular, that one clip gave us as much of an insight as any into this kind of abstract thing that they say: “Well, it’s a unitary executive” I mean, this is a sort of fairly fringe legal argument that now is at the center of our country, which is that you don’t really have any independence in the executive branch; the president leads the executive branch, and therefore, he can hire and fire anybody at any time. There are some things where we have a level of norms, right? I mean, generals can get fired. Previous presidents have fired various senior generals. So, you can’t say that that was against the law. But then you have other things like the Consumer Fraud Protection Bureau — the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, CFPB, or the EEOC, which are independent agencies, and laws suggest that you can’t just fire the people that run those. And the argument here is, “Yes, you can. The president is the president. Separation of powers means that everybody who works for the executive branch, under any circumstances — inspector generals, you name it — they’re all subject to dismissal immediately by the president,” since he has what, you know, he himself, I think, is now referring to as king-like powers. And that is what is driving this. And Vought is an architect of that viewpoint. So, I think that clip turns out to be one of the most important things we did in the run-up to the election, far more important even than we understood at the time. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to ask you — also, you’ve been tracking quite a few of the employees of DOGE. Many of them have not gotten much attention. One of them that you tracked was a woman by the name of Katherine Armstrong Loving, who has been apparently attached to EPA. She, it turns out, is the sibling of Brian Armstrong, who runs the industry crypto company Coinbase, which, by the way, donated, as you mentioned, $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund. How does this square with Trump’s promise to drain the swamp? STEPHEN ENGELBERG: Well, I mean, I think, you know, we’re going to be learning more and more as time goes on. And, you know, it certainly appears that the hiring of people working for DOGE went through the sort of personal networks of various people, you know, people who worked at Palantir, other kind of Silicon Valley things, people from SpaceX. It is not the slightest surprise, I think, to anybody that some of these folks are going to turn out to be siblings, friends and allies of various contributors. The problem here, again, is that if you’re going to give this group of people absolute power and there is no transparency, how is the public to know when they stumble/walk straight into an obvious conflict of interest? I mean, there’s so much going on. You know, there was a moment there where somebody found a contract that the State Department was going to buy $400 million worth of Teslas. And then it was quickly sort of erased. And Trump keeps saying, “Well, we just won’t let Elon do anything that’s a conflict of interest.” But if you look at the range of his companies and his wealth, it’s most of the government. I mean, you know, it isn’t just cars. It isn’t just rockets. You know, Neuralink is a company that has major sort of oversight from the Food and Drug Administration, and he’s trying to create this cutting-edge technology relating to the brain, and so on and so on and so on. So, I mean, you know, there’s nobody home. They fired the main government ethics officer. I mean, I think that’s saying it with words. You talk about draining the swamp as a thing, but let’s not look at what you say. Let’s look at what you do. AMY GOODMAN: We’re going to end with Latisha. Latisha, you are a federal worker with the VA, a very vulnerable population, I mean, the highest in any group of people, the highest number of suicides every day. I hear about the cutting, the slashing of the LGBT office within the VA. If you could start off, though, by talking about the racial composition of federal workers? LATISHA: Yes, Amy. That’s a great question. So, first off, I do want to share that about 30% of our entire federal workforce are U.S. military veterans. And my understanding is that about one in five of all VA employees are veterans, as well. So, you know, not only do I serve veterans in my capacity, I work alongside them, as well. You know, these veterans are the supporters of their families and bring in income for many of our working families, so it will have a deleterious impact on them. Namely — excuse me — there is a long history of Black workers in the public sector. Since 1861, the federal government has been employing Black workers. As of, well, post-World War II, actually, there were about 150,000 Black workers within the federal government. And these folks were lobbying. They were organizing to make sure that everyone in the federal government had more fair working practices, safer conditions and stronger collective bargaining rights. Today, 20% of the entire — of all Black workers in the United States of America work within the public sector, earning a living wage, living with more stability and, importantly, receiving lifesaving, life-changing benefits. In fact, if I’m not mistaken, 25 — or, Black workers in the public sector make about 25% more than those in the private sector. So, yeah, this will have a major impact on Black families specifically. Black families cannot afford to lose these jobs. As a predominantly working-class population, we have to fight, resist DOGE and these austerity measures, and the larger fight for racial justice, and as well as the larger fight to save our democracy. AMY GOODMAN: Latisha, we want to thank you for being with us, a federal worker with Veterans Affairs, member of the American Federation of Government Employees, and Stephen Engelberg, ProPublica editor-in-chief. We’ll link to your piece , “The Trump Administration Keeps Citing an Untrue Stat as It Targets Federal Workers,” and the other pieces that you’ve been involved with. Coming up next, the private company running the migrant detention center in Guantánamo has a history of abuse. Stay with us.
The annual CPAC event was held just outside of Washington, DC this past weekend. During the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) this past weekend, tech billionaire Elon Musk gleefully waved a chainsaw on stage, touting his work as head of the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), which has purged thousands of federal employees since President Donald Trump took office. The conference, held in Washington, D.C., also featured what appeared to be a Nazi salute from right-wing media provocateur Steve Bannon — the second time in a matter of weeks that a Trump loyalist has been accused of performing a Nazi salute on a public stage. Musk, who wore sunglasses indoors for the entirety of his appearance, spent much of his time on stage boasting about DOGE’s work so far, claiming that the legally dubious department has been “fighting the Matrix.” In reality, DOGE has been firing and furloughing federal employees with reckless abandon — even going so far as to terminate workers tasked with keeping track of nuclear weapons , who the Trump administration has since attempted to rehire. DOGE has also frozen federal grants and spending for programs that millions of Americans rely on. The DOGE team is primarily composed of men under the age of 25, many of whom have recently come under fire for their racist, misogynistic and white nationalist online footprints. Musk has expressed similar sentiments, repeatedly endorsing Alternative for Germany (AfD), a neo-Nazi political party whose leaders have promoted vehemently anti-immigration views, downplayed and denied the Holocaust, and suggested that educating Germans about the horrors of Nazism is a “pesky” ordeal. Musk’s interview at CPAC this weekend was his first major public appearance since he performed what appeared to be a Nazi salute during an event on Trump’s inauguration day. Throughout Musk’s rambling appearance — during which he asserted that his mind “is a storm” and “I am become meme” — the billionaire appeared to have a “hard time speaking coherently,” one journalist noted . Before Musk exited the stage, he was gifted a chainsaw from far right Argentine President Javier Milei — a reference to Milei’s “chainsaw plan” to slash public spending and implement a series of drastic austerity measures. Musk waved the chainsaw wildly over his head, vowing to continue gutting the U.S. government. Meanwhile, Bannon’s speech made headlines not for its content, but for featuring what appeared to be a Nazi salute. After imploring a cheering crowd to “fight, fight, fight!” Bannon raised his right arm into the air at a 45 degree angle — a gesture that many experts have condemned as an attempt to pay homage to the brutal Nazi regime that systematically murdered millions in the 1940s. Here's video of Steve Bannon doing a Sieg Heil today at CPAC. It is what it is and it's what Bannon intended. Don't let yourself be gaslit. pic.twitter.com/LDT2kU43ZV Bannon later claimed that he makes the gesture at the “end of all my speeches to thank the crowd.” But even a far right French politician who was set to appear with Bannon recognized the gesture as a Nazi salute, canceling his appearance as a result. “Yesterday, while I was not present in the room, one of the speakers out of provocation allowed himself a gesture alluding to Nazi ideology,” said National Rally leader Jordan Bardella . “I therefore took the immediate decision to cancel my speech that had been scheduled this afternoon.” The conference was also headlined by Trump, who spent his 75-minute speech bragging about his administration’s actions over the past month, including his executive orders rescinding transgender rights; his moves to empower federal agencies to embark on a mass deportation campaign; and DOGE’s purge of thousands of government employees. “We have escorted the radical left bureaucrats out of the building and have locked the doors behind them,” Trump said of the cuts . “We’ve gotten rid of thousands.” Trump also used his speech to denounce media he disagrees with as “a threat to democracy.” Trump’s attacks on the press have been criticized by First Amendment advocates, including Free Press co-CEO Craig Aaron, who has warned that the president’s actions — including his apparent attempt to weaponize the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to target left-leaning news organizations — are indicative of a “free-speech emergency.”
The Federal Unionists Network, a new labor group, mobilized workers in a nationwide “Save Our Services” day of action. This article was originally published by Labor Notes. Federal employee union members have been speaking out, rallying, and suing, as agency after agency has been hit by Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) — a private unaccountable entity which has been demanding access to all government records while spreading wild lies about waste and fraud. Around 20,000 workers have been summarily fired so far. Federal workers raised the alarm at over 30 “Save our Services” rallies around the country Wednesday, including in New York, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Philadelphia, Denver, Boston, Boise, Chattanooga and Chicago. Workers protesting included those fired, or under threat, at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the IRS, Social Security, the Veterans Administration, and an alphabet soup of other agencies that do everything from running national parks to warning residents about impending floods. Protesters warned of the potential privatization of essential services like Social Security and veteran’s healthcare, and the elimination of consumer and environmental protections. “The only way we have out of this is if the federal workforce on the front lines puts out a call to the broader labor movement and enters the streets and makes this a political crisis that they cannot manage,” said Chris Dols, president of IFTPE Local 98 at the Army Corps of Engineers, at one of three Wednesday Save Our Services rallies in New York City. Dols is one of the leaders of a new group, the Federal Unionists Network , which called the protests. Using lists they had been building for months and contacts made through the explosion of energy over the past weeks, members called federal union activists around the country, asking them to bottom-line local actions. Many of these rallies were endorsed by local or national chapters of federal worker unions. “Everybody right now and for the weeks or months or whatever it takes needs to become an organizer,” said Dols. “If you’re a federal employee and you don’t know what your union is, get involved with the FUN, we’ll help you figure it out. If you don’t have a union, we’ll help you learn how to organize one.” First in line for firing, according to the administration, are 200,000 workers who are on probation, usually because they have been in their role for less than 12 months. “It’s stressful because you have probationary people that are learning their job and they’re getting emails with no notice that they’re terminated, just ‘Goodbye’,” said Jaclyn Imperati, an AFGE member who works at the Executive Office of Immigration Review in New York City. “You just changed your life, you left a job to come here, and now you’re being terminated. Wow.” At many agencies, workers report they were put on “administrative leave” in letters that said the worker’s “ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the agency’s current needs, and your performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the agency.” The letter was boilerplate: Workers received them even when they had superb evaluations. The language may be designed to avoid lawsuits by claiming that the firings were for cause. However, some workers said the letters didn’t even include their names, instead containing fields that said ‘firstname’ and ‘lastname.’ Imperati said that people are turning to the union due to the threats. “We doubled our membership in our building the day that all this started happening,” she said. “I think working for the federal government has always been viewed as something that’s protected,” she said. “You can’t just be fired at will. You can’t just be fired because somebody had a bad day.” Now, she said, her co-workers see “the union is the only protection you have from being terminated without cause.” (Federal workplaces are open shop so workers don’t have to join the union.) The Trump administration’s mass firings of federal workers and strangulation of federal funding continued this week at the Federal Housing Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and the Administration for Children and Families, which is responsible for the Head Start program, which offers early childhood education and nutrition services for low income families. Some laid off workers are responsible for checking medical devices to make sure they’re safe. Others work on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Around 400 FAA employees were fired: They do maintenance of FAA navigation equipment. FHA workers help people get mortgages who otherwise can’t get them. On top of the firings, no-one is being hired to fill existing vacancies. “Veterans Affairs, the EPA, the Department of Justice, there’s a hiring freeze across the government,” said American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) staffer Timothy McLaughlin. He said there were already 50,000 vacancies in the VA system. “There’ve been thousands of probationary employees and potential hires who have been told, you’re not coming, we’re retracting our offers,” said McLaughlin. “I’ve gotten calls from people crying. This is ruining people’s lives.” Many of Musk’s and Trump’s actions are being held up in court or walked back as constituents raise hell. Some workers who were told their jobs no longer existed have later been told to come back. “Hands off our research!” was the message at a 500-person rally at the University of Washington in Seattle. Members of Auto Workers Local 4121, the University of Washington Academic Workers, rallied against funding freezes that are bringing their research to a halt and causing layoffs. “I’m proud that I will have contributed something to helping leukemia patients in the future,” said Philip Creamer, a Hematology and Oncology postdoc researcher at the rally, “But I can’t do this without a stable source of funding and so much of that comes from the NIH.” The union plans a rally at the Department of Health and Human Services and nationwide phonebanking aimed at lawmakers. NIH Fellows United, a new union at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, issued a demand to bargain over the hiring freeze, bans on travel, cancellation of all meetings, and a “communications blackout,” the union said. “The law is clear, the Trump administration can’t unilaterally change the terms of our employment,” said Marjorie Levinstein, who is on the union’s bargaining committee and researches drug addiction. They are members of Auto Workers Local 2750. Dols, in New York, urged unionists to think bigger than contract violations: “Sure, our union contracts are being scrapped. They’re breaking the deals and that’s awful. They’re really breaking laws. But the real message is to save our services, because there is no Social Security without Social Security workers. There is no environmental protection without the Environmental Protection Agency and the people who work for it.” “How do you spell corruption?” “E-L-O-N!” workers chanted at the Federal Plaza at a noon picket in New York City. Workers at the CFPB, at Social Security, and at IRS, charged that Musk’s minions have been grabbing the public’s data with no oversight or accountability. Spencer Gould, vice president of NTEU chapter 47 at the IRS in New York said that the unions are the front line of defense as Elon Musk and Trump “are grabbing the personal data of every American, to do who knows what for who knows who.” “They are smashing the institutions that are the parts of government that house the democracy of our country,” he said. Musk is head of a private entity, DOGE, and neither DOGE nor his appointment to lead it was brought before Congress. A fight over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), formed after the 2008 financial meltdown, is in the courts. The Trump administration installed a director who ordered the agency to shut down, but the Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) sued, and a court order is currently keeping it open. Musk prematurely tweeted “CFPB RIP” on February 7. CFPB worker Jasmine Hardy explained her job at a New York rally: “When there are credit reporting errors, preventing people from getting access to credit, we can fix those errors.” Hardy is Vice President of NTEU Chapter 335. She said it’s hard to track down the records and set things straight, “but that’s what I’m going to do, because I want to work for the American people.” Hardy said that the CFPB has won back $21 billion for the public since it started, by limiting excessive bank overdraft fees, credit card fees, and fees banks like to charge just because they can. Bankers and billionaires, naturally, don’t like the agency. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who championed the creation of the Bureau, suggested that Musk’s animosity comes from his plan to create “X Money” as part of a plan to make X (formerly Twitter) the “everything app.” “Guess which agency would be making sure that Elon’s new project couldn’t scam you or steal your sensitive personal data?” said Warren, “The CFPB.” “The division of powers and the checks and balances have somehow fallen apart,” said Dols. “It is now up to us to follow through on our oath to the Constitution, to the government we serve, and the public we serve, to make sure that Elon Musk does not get away with this.” Joe DeManuelle-Hall and Danielle Smith contributed reporting.
An unelected IT task force is taking over the controls of government with no legal authority, putting us all at risk. An unelected IT task force is taking over the controls of government with no legal authority, putting us all at risk. After Donald Trump’s election in November, big-time donor and billionaire adviser Elon Musk began to outline his plans to slash government spending through something called the “department of government efficiency” (DOGE), a name referencing a 2010s dog meme and a cryptocurrency created as a joke in 2013. But it wasn’t clear exactly what form Musk’s task force would take until Inauguration Day, when Donald Trump issued an executive order repurposing the existing U.S. Digital Service as the “U.S. DOGE Service,” and tasking it with “modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.” The order further stated that small DOGE teams would be embedded in various federal departments, where they would have access to “all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems.” Legally, this makes DOGE something like an IT task force — and notably, not a real government agency or department. Officially, Musk and DOGE aides are “special government employees,” a designation generally used for part-time expert consultants working no more than 130 days of the year. In fact, in an ongoing court case against Musk, the White House administration alleged on February 17 that “Mr Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself,” and that “Mr Musk is not the U.S. DOGE Service Administrator.” But that’s on paper. Over the ensuing weeks, Trump and Musk have continued to demonstrate that they have no respect for rules, laws or the Constitution. Musk is running DOGE as if it were the most powerful part of government — putting officials on leave, accessing private data, shutting down federal agencies and overriding spending authorized by Congress. On February 10, New York Magazine identified 18 agencies and departments that DOGE has accessed , including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Defense Department, the Department of Education, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Social Security Administration (SSA) and Veterans Affairs (VA). “There is not one single entity holding Musk accountable,” historian Douglas Brinkley told The New York Times . “It’s a harbinger of the destruction of our basic institutions.” A federal official witnessing the DOGE takeover warned the paper: “Before Congress and the courts can respond, Elon Musk will have rolled up the whole government.” One of DOGE’s most high-profile and terrifying breaches was of the Treasury Department, which manages the country’s finances by collecting taxes, paying bills and producing money. In late January, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent allowed DOGE members to access the Treasury’s payment system, a unit known as the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS). This previously little-known but hugely important office processed nearly 1.3 billion payments in fiscal year 2023, totaling $5.4 trillion , including tax returns, Social Security benefits, disability payments and federal salaries. BFS is overseen by nonpartisan career employees who are highly trained and subject to monitoring and oversight. DOGE affiliates allegedly began requesting access to BFS in December, according to The New York Times ,but were repeatedly denied by David Lebryk, Treasury’s most senior career civil servant. But after inauguration, the pressure grew. On January 24, Trump’s newly appointed Treasury chief of staff emailed a group of department officials, stating that BFS access should be given to Tom Krause, a software executive and Musk ally affiliated with DOGE, so that Krause could pause USAID payments. Again, Lebryk pushed back, noting that the Treasury does not have the legal authority to turn off authorized payments. Within days, Lebryk was pushed out of his job, and Bessent granted BFS access to Krause and the DOGE team. Outsiders accessing this closely guarded payment system could lead to several major crises. First, Musk and his aides have gained access to the private data of individuals, including bank account information and social security numbers, violating Americans’ privacy and opening the door for cyber-attacks. It also means Musk, a walking conflict of interest, now holds sensitive information about his competitors and their government contracts. But perhaps most concerning of all, experts fear the rogue DOGE team will use its access to stop congressionally approved payments that do not align with Trump’s goals — like it already attempted to do with USAID payments. When news of DOGE’s actions at the Treasury spread, opposition quickly mounted. On February 3, two labor unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans sued Bessent, Treasury and the BFS for illegally disclosing individuals’ sensitive information to Musk, a private citizen. “The scale of the intrusion into individuals’ privacy is massive and unprecedented,” stated the complaint. “People who must share information with the federal government should not be forced to share information with Elon Musk or his ‘DOGE.’ And federal law says they do not have to.” The following day, on February 4, protesters outside the Treasury were joined by congressional Democrats , who were denied entry to the building. Trump’s Treasury Department repeatedly attempted to assure politicians that DOGE’s access to the BFS payment system was “read-only,” meaning agents could not make changes, and that no payments had been canceled. But these claims drew skepticism: After all, the Treasury chief of staff had sent emails about plans to stop USAID payments, and Musk repeatedly boasted on social media about allegedly cancelling payments. “Why on earth should we believe that, particularly when he is saying the exact opposite, loudly and repeatedly for everyone to see?” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, asked Politico . Sure enough, as WIRED soon revealed, the access was not read-only. A 25-year-old “special government employee” named Marko Elez did, in fact, have write access . In a court filing on February 11, Treasury officials walked back their earlier denials , stating that Elez had “mistakenly” and “briefly” had the power to alter the payments database. The filings also confirmed that the DOGE team had initially sought BFS access with plans to cancel USAID payments. Many experts say the access is concerning either way. “It’s a distinction without a difference,” one source told WIRED , pointing out that Elez should not have had “access to this almost $5 trillion payment flow, even if it’s ‘read-only.’ None of this should be happening.” Elez temporarily resigned from DOGE after the Wall Street Journal pointed to a series of racist social media posts from his accounts — but Musk has since reinstated him. On February 13, the Treasury’s Department’s Office of Inspector General informed Democratic senators that it had launched an audit into ongoings at BFS, including studying the “adequacy of controls in place” for granting access to the payment systems and for making sure payments are made in accordance with the law, as well as reviewing the so-called fraudulent payments DOGE claims to have found. “Elon Musk and DOGE can’t be allowed to creep on Americans’ most sensitive data as they operate in the shadows,” Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said in a statement , following the Inspector General announcement. “This is an important step, and inspectors general must be free to pursue their investigations without interference.” The Inspector General letter noted that, “given the breadth of this effort,” the audit will likely take until August — noting that the Office will provide interim updates if it uncovers critical issues. Meanwhile, on February 6, in the lawsuit brought by the unions, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly temporarily banned Special Government Employees from accessing Treasury payment records and systems. She exempted Krause and Elez, who were permitted continued read-only access. In another lawsuit filed on February 7, 19 state attorneys general argue that allowing DOGE to rifle through the Treasury payments system is causing “ongoing harm to States and their residents.” The following day, U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer issued an emergency order , banning any “political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department” from accessing Treasury systems containing confidential information, and ordering them to immediately delete any downloaded material. Another judge extended that order on February 14. In his order, Judge Engelmayer noted that current policies presented a risk of “disclosure of sensitive and confidential information,” as well as “the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking.” As the two lawsuits progress — along with many others seeking to block various executive orders — it has yet to be seen if Trump, Musk and their allies will obey court orders . Defiance would be unprecedented: As The New York Times pointed out recently, a 2018 Harvard Law Review article could not find any instances of “open presidential defiance of court orders in the years since 1865.” Yet, Republican leaders are performatively pretending that the flurry of federal injunctions and temporary restraining orders represent judicial overreach. The White House accused Judge Engelmayer of being an “activist judge,” and Musk called for his impeachment. Vice President J.D. Vance made the wildly incorrect claim on social media that “Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.” The administration’s comments drew sharp criticism from the American Bar Association (ABA), which said these claims “create a risk to the physical security of judges and have no place in our society.” To disobey court orders, it continued, is to “threaten the very foundation of our constitutional system.” Yet many fear that is exactly where Trump is headed. In fact, he may have already started. On January 31, a federal judge in Rhode Island issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from freezing federal payments. But on February 10, just three weeks into his presidency, the judge ruled that the Trump administration has continued to freeze some federal funds — in blatant violation of the order.
Vance also gave a speech in Munich, hypocritically scolding Europe’s leaders for many actions Trump has engaged in. Last week, Vice President J.D. Vance met with Alternative for Germany (AfD) co-chair Alice Weidel, a political leader in that party who has downplayed the significance of the Holocaust and whose party has been described by many as a neo-Nazi organization . The meeting took place while Vance visited the country, where he also spoke at a security conference taking place in Munich, issuing demands for other countries to be more open to far right political movements. AfD is designated as a “suspected extremist” organization by Germany’s government. The party is vehemently anti-immigration , particularly toward Muslim people. Its leaders have also espoused antisemitic viewpoints and have downplayed or outright denied the Holocaust. Weidel is among them. Recently, she has complained about the Holocaust being “politically instrumentalized” against her political party . She also described efforts to maintain the educational history of Holocaust as “pesky,” and visibly rolled her eyes at discussion of the historical event that involved the mass killing of millions of people by the Nazi regime. At the meeting between Vance and Weidel , the two discussed the war between Russia and Ukraine, German domestic policies, and also restrictions within the country against ultra-nationalist political parties being able to take part in elections. Vance also met with other political leaders in Germany, but his meeting with a member of the AfD is notable because of how far to the right the party is — and how giving them attention could be an attempt by the Trump administration to legitimize them. Although AfD is currently polling in second place for a nationwide election scheduled for later this month, all of the other major political parties in Germany have agreed not to form a new coalition government with the far right group . Vance is the second major figure in the Trump administration to have interacted directly with AfD. Elon Musk, head of the White House’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” has also spoken fondly of AfD, endorsing the neo-Nazi party and speaking at one of their rallies late in January — just days after he was accused of performing a Nazi salute multiple times during one of Trump’s inauguration festivities. Vance has also been criticized for the speech he gave in Munich last week, in which he chastised Germany and other European nations for purportedly being against free speech. Many of the statements Vance made within that speech were hypocritical, as he complained about actions supposedly taken by governments to quell free speech or a free press that President Donald Trump or the Trump administration have taken in the past . Vance, for example, chided a recent judicial decision in Romania to annul the first round of a presidential election, which resulted in a far right candidate, Călin Georgescu, advancing with the most votes. The judge in that case came to that decision from evidence showing Georgescu had benefited immensely from a mass influence campaign orchestrated by Russian actors . “When we see European courts canceling elections and senior officials threatening to cancel others, we ought to ask whether we’re holding ourselves to an appropriately high standard,” Vance said in his speech — ignoring the fact that Trump himself had tried to overturn his loss in the 2020 presidential election and had made multiple threats to do it again if he lost the 2024 race . Vance also tried to suggest that European countries were infringing on individuals’ speech rights, asserting that the Trump administration was the epitome of defending such freedoms. “In Washington, there is a new sheriff in town. And under Donald Trump’s leadership, we may disagree with your views, but we will fight to defend your right to offer them in the public square,” Vance said . Again, the vice president’s claim here ignores Trump’s storied antagonistic relationship with the free press in the United States, where he has constantly called for news media to lose their “licenses” over reporting about him that he disliked. More recently, the Trump White House has refused to allow reporters from The Associated Press (AP) to attend news events involving the president over AP ’s decision to continue calling the body of water south of the U.S., the Gulf of Mexico, instead of the administration-approved moniker, “the Gulf of America.” Further, in his first campaign for president (and indeed in his campaign in 2024 ), Trump repeatedly admonished his political opponents, hinting he would use the Department of Justice (DOJ) to punish them. Trump also infamously led chants of “lock her up” against 2016 Democratic candidate for president Hillary Clinton . Despite that history, Vance still promulgated the myth that he and Trump abided by the ideal that, in the U.S., “you cannot win a democratic mandate by censoring your opponents or putting them in jail.” After Vance’s speech, current German Chancellor Olaf Scholz blasted him for effectively propping up far right political movements in Europe. “I expressly reject what US Vice President Vance said at the Munich Security Conference,” Scholz said in a social media post , advocating for a continued “firewall against extreme right-wing parties.”
“There is no way to overstate how serious a breach this is,” one critic of “DOGE’s” work said. The acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration has resigned from her post, after serving the agency for over three decades, in opposition to Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (“DOGE”) attempting to gain access to sensitive data. The exact nature of what is included within “DOGE’s” search is as yet unknown, but experts have stated that it could be very intrusive of the personal information of millions of Americans. Michelle King, who was selected by the Trump administration to serve as acting commissioner, refused a request from “DOGE” to access the data, and resigned from her position in protest of their actions. She was replaced by Leland Dudek, a manager at the agency in charge of its anti-fraud office. Dudek was chosen ahead of dozens of individuals higher up in the chain of command within the agency , perhaps an indication that his selection was based more on loyalty to President Donald Trump and/or Elon Musk than it was on merit, as resignations in other departments within the Trump administration have embarrassingly resulted in next-in-line figures also refusing to go along with the White House’s demands, most notably within the Justice Department last week . “DOGE” has torn through a number of government agencies and departments, and has breached numerous secure systems, including by gaining access to “top-secret” systems in the Treasury Department . Critics of “DOGE’s” attempts to enter similar systems within the Social Security office are suggesting that the questionably legal “department” has likely already accessed them . “There is no way to overstate how serious a breach this is,” said Nancy Altman , president of Social Security Works, an organization that advocates on behalf of preserving the agency and its work. Altman added that, given the numerous examples of the Trump administration taking a retributional approach to some of the president’s political opponents, access to Social Security files is incredibly alarming. “If there is an intent to punish perceived enemies, someone could erase your earnings record, making it impossible to collect the Social Security and Medicare benefits you have earned,” Altman said . Martin O’Malley, a former Social Security Administration commissioner (as well as former governor of Maryland), also criticized “DOGE’s” actions within the agency, warning that Musk’s team could interrupt the payment service that millions of Americans rely on. “At this rate, will break it. And they will break it fast, and there will be an interruption of benefits,” O’Malley said to The Washington Post . “DOGE’s” breach of the Social Security Administration isn’t exactly a surprise — during the 2024 presidential campaign, now-Vice President J.D. Vance indicated that Elon Musk could lead a task force to purportedly audit the agency . As head of “DOGE,” Musk has already made unfounded claims about Social Security, making attacks against how it’s being managed, which suggests cuts to the program could be coming. For example, during a press conference in the Oval Office last week, Musk said a “cursory examination of Social Security” discovered that there were people receiving benefits from the program that are 150 years old. “Now, do you know anyone that’s 150? I don’t,” Musk said. “They should be in the Guinness Book of World Records. … So that’s a case where I think they’re probably dead.” But Musk’s claims disregard how the agency is run, and may be more indicative of his and the “DOGE” staff’s ignorance about coding systems used by the Social Security Administration, which utilizes a reference point dating back to 1875 in cases where a specific date may be unknown, a fact-check from Wired noted . Indeed, the agency automatically disenrolls recipients who are over the age of 115 , a failsafe to prevent fraud from happening. Speaking to that publication, former NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake blasted Musk and “DOGE” for failing to take the time to understand systems they’re unfamiliar with. “DOGE going into all these agencies with largely unfettered access with a wrecking ball and no understanding of the business logic and structure behind the code, database and configured business logic, related payment systems, and integrated decision trees, poses real risks to the privacy and persona-level data of millions of people across all of those records,” Drake said .
The ad had been scheduled to be delivered to members of Congress as well as subscribers at the Pentagon and White House. Critics of the Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post are targeting the newspaper over its “ gutless ” refusal to run a paid wrap-around advertisement that makes a prominent demand for President Donald Trump to fire mega-billionaire Elon Musk from his cohort of inner-most advisers. The special ad, at a cost of $115,000, was orchestrated by the pro-democracy watchdog Common Cause, a progressive advocacy group and had been scheduled to be delivered to members of Congress as well as subscribers at the Pentagon and White House on Tuesday. On Friday, however, the group was notified by the newspaper that it was backing out of the arrangement. Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post didn’t want you to see our ad questioning who’s in charge of this White House. We wont’t stop holding power accountable. “Elon Musk is attempting to run our government like one of his companies, and it’s hurting the American people,” reads some of the language of the campaign on which the ad is based. “Even more concerning is that President Donald Trump is allowing it to happen. It’s time to say enough and FIRE Elon Musk from any role within our government.” The campaign, like the ad refused by the Post , points people to an online petition where they can back the demand Musk be fired and information to contact their members of Congress. “Our elected officials are totally abandoning their duty to their constituents while Elon Musk does as he pleases,” reads the call to action. “Whether your senators are on the right, on the left, or in the center, they ALL need to hear from everyday Americans like us today.” The Hill , given an exclusive for the story, reports that one of the ironies of the situation is that when the Post gave Common Cause a sample look at how the advertisement would appear, the example was a previously run ad by the the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), an industry lobby group, highlighting the new president’s promise to “end the electric vehicle mandate on Day 1,” which included an image of a smiling Trump with his thumbs up. “They gave us some sample art to show us what it would look like,” Kase Solomón, president of Common Cause, explained. “It was a thank-you Donald Trump piece of art.” According to The Hill : The ad’s design features a large picture of Musk with his head tilted back, laughing, along with a cutout image of the White House and large white text: “Who’s running this country: Donald Trump or Elon Musk?” Lower down on the page it features smaller font text stating: “Since day one, Elon has created chaos and confusion and put our livelihoods at risk. And he is accountable to no one but himself.” “The Constitution only allows for one president at a time. Call your senators and tell them it’s time Donald Trump fire Elon Musk, ” it says, followed by the URL FireMusk.org. Here’s what the ad was supposed to look like: The ad: pic.twitter.com/jcDvCZljyy Solomón said it was not clear why the newspaper made its decision, but it seemed very much to do with the nature of the ad’s content and possibly to with the political leanings of the Post ’s owner, the second-richest man in the world after Musk himself. Both men have major business interests that could be injured if they run afoul of President Trump. “Is it because we’re critical of what’s happening with Elon Musk?” asked Solomón. “Is it only okay to run things in The Post now that won’t anger the president or won’t have him calling Jeff Bezos asking why this was allowed?”
It’s the latest brazen signal that he doesn’t recognize limits on his authority to impose his far right agenda. Fears that the United States is in the midst of a constitutional crisis — or something significantly worse — intensified Saturday after President Donald Trump wrote in a social media post that “he who saves his country does not violate any law,” a variation of a quote attributed to Napoleon Bonaparte. Trump’s post on X — the platform owned by billionaire shadow government leader Elon Musk — came as his administration continued its sweeping and destructive assault on the federal government and workforce, running roughshod over the law in the process. Trump’s post Saturday was the latest brazen signal that the president doesn’t recognize limits on his authority to impose his far-right agenda. New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie called Trump’s message “the single most un-American and anti-constitutional statement ever uttered by an American president.” Since taking office less than a month ago, Trump and Musk have moved aggressively to dismantle federal agencies and remove any officials who could shine light on or obstruct their efforts. Trump, his handpicked Cabinet officials, and Musk have also disregarded or openly attacked the other two co-equal branches of government, accusing judges who have moved to halt or limit the new administration’s actions of being Democratic partisans. In some cases , the Trump administration has actively defied rulings from federal courts, an alarming indication of what’s to come. Yasmin Abusaif and Douglas Keith of the Brennan Center for Justice noted Friday that “the last time the United States saw widespread open defiance of court orders by elected officials was when governors in Southern states refused to integrate their schools after the Supreme Court ruled against segregation in public education in Brown v. Board of Education .” “President Dwight Eisenhower — though he was no fan of the court’s decision — ultimately dispatched troops to the South to help enforce the ruling, saying , ‘The Supreme Court has spoken and I am sworn to uphold the constitutional process in this country, and I will obey,'” Abusaif and Keith continued. “The governors’ efforts to defy court orders are widely acknowledged as one of the most shameful periods in U.S. history.” Frank Bowman, a law professor and former federal and state prosecutor, wrote for Slate last week that “with each passing day, the practical ability of the courts to stop, or even materially hinder, the catastrophe diminishes.” “If Trump successfully defies the courts,” Bowman added, “the only remaining obstacle to dictatorship will be public revulsion, national popular protest, and the hope that such a reaction would cause Trump to retreat and, at long last, recall some fraction of the Republican Party to its constitutional duty.”
The next four years will be filled with battles as resistance springs up amid the administration’s assault on workers. The Trump administration has wasted no time attacking worker rights and bestowing even more power to employers through a barrage of anti-worker executive orders since Trump’s second term began. Within his first two weeks in office, Trump rapidly targeted LGBTQIA+ workers and undid civil rights protections. He fired two Democratic commissioners on the five-person Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). He terminated Chair Charlotte Burrows, whose term was supposed to last until July 2028, and Vice Chair Jocelyn Samuels, whose term was supposed to last until July 2026. He also fired EEOC General Counsel Karla Gilbride, whose four-year term wasn’t supposed to end until 2027. These moves leave only the commission without a quorum, which means that the organization taxed with enforcing federal laws against job discrimination is effectively powerless. The 60-year executive order granting the Department of Labor the necessary tools to protect the civil rights of federal contract workers was rolled back and the department was ordered to stop ongoing investigations into civil rights violations. The president also fired more than a dozen inspectors at government agencies, including the Department of Labor. The “Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” executive order is a clear attack on trans people, including in the workplace. The move directs agencies like the Department of Labor and the EEOC to rescind its updated workplace harassment policies, which include protections for trans and gender-nonconforming people. The administration also signed an order barring transgender people from serving in the military, a move that could eject nearly 15,000 people over their identity; rescinded a Biden administration executive order that directed employers to strengthen protections for LGBTQ people; instructed federal workers to delete their pronouns from email signatures; and removed documents connected to LGBTQ protections from the EEOC website. The president has instituted a federal hiring freeze, mandated a return to the office for nearly every remote federal worker, and reclassified thousands of federal employees in order to make them easier to fire. He also sent out a government-wide email inviting federal workers to quit their jobs as part of a “ deferred resignation program ” that would pay them through September. A group of unions (the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE); AFGE Local 3707; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); and the National Association of Government Employees) are suing Trump over that program. “We are filing this lawsuit to stop the purge of qualified professionals from the federal government workforce. Not only are these actions illegal and a scam, but they are eroding the health and well-being of our communities,” said AFSCME President Lee Saunders in a statement. “These workers do everything from making sure families receive their Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits on time to protecting our drinking water and the food we eat to overseeing our national security. If this chaos goes unchecked, it will have devastating impacts on working people.” “A climate of fear makes our workplaces and communities less safe. Mass deportation policies threaten civil liberties, encourage racial profiling, separate families and cause massive economic and emotional hardship.” The Wall Street Journal reports that the administration is on the verge of implementing an executive order that would fire thousands of federal health workers and Trump has moved to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, which employs 10,000 people. He’s also submitted regulations to weaken federal worker protections, signed an executive order to reduce the size of the federal workforce, and fired a Democratic member of the federal employee appeals board. The Economic Policy Institute’s Senior Policy Analyst Margaret Poydock told Truthout that these moves are “aimed at gutting the federal workforce and politicizing the career civil service.” Labor advocates had anticipated Trump would revamp the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to suit his administration’s corporate agenda, but how it would unfold when he took office had remained unclear. He fired NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo right away, which was expected. However rather than going through the usual steps of appointing a partisan majority, he also fired Democratic board member Gwynne Wilcox, the first Black woman to serve on the board. The move is unprecedented in addition to being against the law, and Wilcox said she is “pursuing all legal avenues to challenge removal.” On February 1, Trump fired Abruzzo’s successor, Acting General Counsel Jessica Rutter. The firings reduced the board to just two members, which means that, like the EEOC, the board lacks a quorum and cannot issue any decisions or regulations. This allows companies to ignore labor law by dragging out cases in which a board ruling is needed. Employers are already using the development to their advantage. After Whole Foods workers voted to unionize in Philadelphia, the company asked the NLRB to overturn the victory. “In the absence of a Board quorum, the Regional Director lacks statutory authority to investigate objections or certify the results, or otherwise engage in representation case procedures, including investigating objections or conducting the objections process,” reads the filing. At Slate , Mark Joseph Stern points out that the goal of these firings may extend beyond impeding another federal agency. A depleted NLRB sets the stage for Trump to terminate the 1935 precedent Humphrey’s Executor , a decision that allowed Congress to protect independent agencies from partisan interference and prohibited the president from removing members of such agencies. The GOP-controlled Supreme Court has essentially been circling the decision in recent years, expanding the president’s power to fire regulators, but so far that precedent has only applied to multimember commissions. “If the Supreme Court does scrap Humphrey’s , it will probably unleash a spate of firings across other independent agencies,” writes Stern. Jack Goldsmith, who ran the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel in the Bush administration, told The New York Times that the Trump administration might have made the moves in hopes of igniting legal challenges. “On one level, this seems designed to invite courts to push back because much of it is illegal and the overall message is a boundless view of executive power,” said Goldsmith. “But really, they are clearly setting up test cases.” Destroying the NLRB has been a long-time goal of billionaire and Trump adviser Elon Musk. In January 2024, Musk’s SpaceX company launched a lawsuit against the board after it accused the GOP megadonor of illegally firing workers. In November 2024, SpaceX and Amazon entered the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to argue that the NLRB is unconstitutional. In addition to heightening Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, the Trump administration has also taken legislative steps to punish immigrants. In January, Trump signed the Laken Riley Act , which found bipartisan support in the House weeks before he took office and in the Senate just hours after Joe Biden left. Framed by lawmakers as a bill aimed at protecting people from violence, the bill allows states to weaponize the law against the most vulnerable members of communities. With its passage, enforcement officers are allowed to indefinitely detain immigrants without bail, just for being accused of nonviolent, low-level crimes. “A climate of fear makes our workplaces and communities less safe. Mass deportation policies threaten civil liberties, encourage racial profiling, separate families and cause massive economic and emotional hardship for millions of working people across the country,” read a statement from the AFL-CIO from a recent Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing. “The terror instilled by raids and targeting means that fewer people report crimes, visit a doctor, or send their kids to school — all of which undermines the health, wellbeing and safety of our communities.” As seen during the first Trump administration, many opponents will attempt to counter his political agenda in courts and in the halls of Congress. However, myriad legal challenges did not stop Trump from retaking power, and many perceive the Democratic response to the administration’s overreach as inadequate. Some of the most crucial battles will take place in the workplace and on the streets. Recent examples of this disconnect include the Democrats’ failure to extend former NLRB Chair Lauren McFerran’s term, their insistence on launching task forces as opposed to actual plans and Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’s claim that the party lacks the leverage to stop Trump. The work of progressive lawmakers and the work of attorneys will no doubt be important in the coming years, but some of the most crucial battles will take place in the workplace and on the streets. Direct action and coordinated pressure are already having an impact. In Chicago, the immigrant rights movement launched education campaigns to counter the imminent ICE raids. “The city’s vast networks of workers’ centers, unions, and community organizations have spent months preparing, disbursing flyers and cards, and sending the message to residents: Don’t talk to ICE,” Sarah Lazare and Rebecca Burns explained in an In These Times article. “The two-hour training at Arise Chicago’s offices yesterday night was the organization’s sixth in-house training that month, and just one of numerous actions taking place across the city to defend immigrant residents.” Trump’s “border czar” Tom Homan has openly complained that such education is impeding ICE from deporting people. “Sanctuary cities are making it very difficult,” he recently told CNN . ​“For instance, Chicago … they’ve been educated on how to defy ICE, how to hide from ICE.” After labor reporter Kim Kelly revealed that Elon Musk’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) was planning to access the internal systems of the Department of Labor, hundreds of workers showed up outside the Frances Perkins Building to protest the move. “This is about our health,” AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler told the crowd. “This is about our safety. This is about our jobs,” she declared. “Mine workers, construction workers, laborers, nurses — all are protected by DOL . And because of the people in this building, we can stand up.” On the same day, a coalition of unions filed a lawsuit aimed at blocking Musk’s team from accessing Department of Labor files. In response to the backlash, Musk’s ​“kickoff meeting” at the Department of Labor was reportedly moved from an in-person event to a virtual one, proof that any form of backlash can potentially impede the administration’s designs. A recent Washington Post article details how some federal employees are engaging in workplace resistance to fight back, which includes workers creating an encrypted chat to shield the administration from sensitive data and marking emails from Trump as spam — “just to piss them off.” “The 2.3 million civilian federal workers have found themselves on the front lines of Trump’s war against the bureaucracy, and, in ways cosmetic and substantive, some are mounting a defense,” the article explains . The last couple weeks have been a whirlwind, but the Trump administration is just starting to implement its policy agenda. The next four years will be filled with battles for the working class and it remains to be seen what form those will take.
More than 10,000 student complaints related to disability access and sexual and racial harassment are on hold. This story was originally published by ProPublica , a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. In the three-and-a-half weeks since Donald Trump returned to the presidency, investigations by the agency that handles allegations of civil rights violations in the nation’s schools and colleges have ground to a halt. At the same time, there’s been a dramatic drop in the number of new cases opened by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights — and the few that attorneys have been directed to investigate reflect some of Trump’s priorities: getting rid of gender-neutral bathrooms, banning transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports and alleged antisemitism or discrimination against white students. The OCR has opened about 20 new investigations since Trump’s inauguration, sources inside the department told ProPublica , a low number compared with similar periods in previous years. During the first three weeks of the Biden administration, for instance, the office opened about 110 new investigations into discrimination based on race, gender, national origin or disability, the office’s historic priorities. More than 250 new cases were opened in the same time period last year. Historically, the bulk of investigations in the office have been launched after students or their families file complaints. Since Trump took office, the focus has shifted to “directed investigations,” meaning that the Trump administration has ordered those inquiries. “We have not been able to open any (investigations) that come from the public,” said one longtime OCR attorney who asked not to be named for fear of losing their job. Several employees told ProPublica that they have been told not to communicate with the students, families and schools involved in cases launched in previous administrations and to cancel scheduled meetings and mediations. “We’ve been essentially muzzled,” the attorney said. A spokesperson for the Education Department did not respond to requests for comment. Even though new case openings typically slow during a presidential transition as new political appointees gain their footing and set priorities, it is not typical for it to all but stop. “Under the first Trump administration, of course things shifted and there were changes, but we never had this gag order on us,” said another OCR attorney who also asked not to be named. The shift at the OCR comes as Trump has called the Education Department a “con job” and is expected to issue an executive order that the department be dismantled. In her confirmation hearing on Thursday, Trump’s nominee to be education secretary, Linda McMahon, said she hadn’t decided whether to cut funding to the OCR, as Republicans have called for . This week, the Trump administration terminated more than $900 million in contracts that mostly focused on education research and data on learning and the country’s schools. The cuts were made at the behest of Elon Musk’s cost-cutting crew , known as the Department of Government Efficiency, which said it also ended dozens of training grants for educators that it deemed wasteful. Since 1979, the department’s civil rights arm has worked to enforce the nation’s antidiscrimination laws in schools . It operates under a congressional mandate to uphold the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as well as the federal laws that prohibit discriminating against students because of gender or disability. About 12,000 complaints were under investigation when Trump took office. The largest share of pending complaints — about 6,000 — are related to students with disabilities who feel they’ve been mistreated or unfairly denied help at school, according to a ProPublica analysis of department data. Investigators were pursuing about 3,200 active complaints of racial discrimination, including unfair discipline and racial harassment. An additional roughly 1,000 complaints were specific to sexual harassment or sexual violence, the analysis found. The remainder concern a range of discrimination claims. Students and families often turn to the OCR after they feel their concerns have not been addressed by their school districts. The process is free, which means even if families can’t afford a lawyer to pursue a lawsuit, they may still get relief — access to disabilities services or increased safety at school, for example. When the OCR finds evidence of discrimination, it can force a school district or college to change its policies or provide services to a student, and it sometimes monitors the institutions to make sure they comply. Last fall, for example, the OCR concluded that a rural Pennsylvania school district had failed to protect Black students from racist taunts and harassment by a group of white students. White students in the Norwin School District had circulated a photo of themselves labeled “Kool Kids Klub,” wore Confederate flag clothing, told a Black student to “go pick cotton” and used racial epithets, investigators found. District officials initially said they saw no problem with some of the white students’ behavior and did not believe the students had created a racially hostile environment. But the OCR’s findings and corrective action required the district to study several years of racial harassment complaints and undergo training on how to better respond to racial conflict in the district. The department’s power to hold schools accountable when they fail to protect students and provide relief in real time — while a student is still in school — makes its work urgent, civil rights attorneys and department staff said. About 600 of the Education Department’s roughly 4,000 employees work in the OCR, either at the Washington headquarters or one of 12 regional offices. At least 74 department employees, some of whom had taken diversity training, have been placed on administrative leave, according to Sheria Smith, an OCR attorney and president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, a union that represents nonmanagement Education Department employees. Smith said 15 of those workers on leave are from the OCR. Fifty newer Education Department employees were fired Wednesday, she said, including three from the OCR. “The one thing that is clear right now is we have a complete disruption of the services we provide and are hearing from our stakeholders,” Smith said, citing as an example a Kentucky family reaching out to silenced OCR workers to plead for answers about the complaint they’d made about how their elementary school handled their child’s sexual assault. “It is the members of the public that are suffering with these disruptions,” she said. Another department employee who asked not to be identified, fearing they could lose their job, said a number of the students’ complaints are urgent. “Many of these students are in crisis,” the employee said. “They are counting on some kind of intervention to get that student back in school and graduate or get accommodations.” There are students who need help now, the employee said. “And now the federal government is literally doing nothing.” The department’s new leadership has said publicly it plans to broaden the types of discrimination the department will investigate. Among the cases it is investigating is whether one all-gender restroom in a Denver high school discriminates against girls. The acting head of the OCR even took the unusual step of announcing the investigation in a press release, something previous administrations typically did not do. “Let me be clear: it is a new day in America, and under President Trump, OCR will not tolerate discrimination of any kind,” acting OCR head Craig Trainor said in the press release announcing that he had directed civil rights staff to investigate a Denver Public Schools bathroom because it “appears to directly violate the civil rights of the District’s female students.” Denver schools spokesperson Scott Pribble called the investigation “unprecedented.” He added, “This is not the first all-gender bathroom we have in a school, but it’s the first time an investigation has been opened by OCR.” There are other girls’ restrooms in the school; only one was converted to an all-gender restroom after students lobbied school administrators to do so. Trainor again took a tough approach on Wednesday when he announced a new investigation into high school athletics groups in Minnesota and California, both of which have said they would not shut transgender women out of women’s sports. The administration had already opened three similar investigations against other institutions for alleged violations of Title IX, the federal law that prevents gender-based discrimination in education programs, in response to the executive order Trump had signed to ban transgender women and girls from participating in women’s sports. The states “are free to engage in all the meaningless virtue-signaling that they want, but at the end of the day they must abide by federal law,” Trainor said. The OCR also decided that it would investigate a complaint filed in August by the Equal Protection Project, a conservative nonprofit, that alleges discrimination against white students. The Biden administration had not acted on the complaint, but new department leaders decided within days that it would proceed with an investigation. The complaint alleges that the Ithaca City School District in New York excluded white students by hosting an event called the Students of Color Summit. Cornell University professor William Jacobson, who founded the Equal Protection Project, said his organization has filed about 60 complaints over the years with the OCR, some of which remain under investigation. Asked whether he thought the change in administration helped fast-track the Ithaca complaint, he said, “I don’t see how it could have hurt.” “We want evenhanded enforcement, and we hope the department will be more aggressive than it has in the past,” Jacobson said. “If there are programs that exclude Black students, we want the department to go after that, but I am not aware of such programs.” Ithaca school officials declined to comment. Catherine Lhamon, who oversaw the OCR under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, questioned the current administration’s approach of issuing press releases to announce investigations. One announcement included a quote from a former collegiate athlete who has railed against transgender women in sports. “It’s hugely political and suggests a conclusion before the OCR has even conducted an investigation,” Lhamon said. The agency, she said, is supposed to be a neutral fact-finder. The agency appears to have ended its long-standing practice of making public a list of institutions that are being investigated and what type of discrimination is alleged. That was last updated Jan. 14, the week before Trump’s inauguration.
Trump and Musk are slashing global vaccination efforts, funding for medical research and access to health information. Remember “alternative facts”? It’s been eight years since Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to President Donald Trump, uttered those words during a “Meet the Press” interview. The patently Orwellian phrase set off a firestorm of coverage: According to Conway, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer wasn’t lying when he said Trump had drawn “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration,” despite clear evidence to the contrary. Spicer’s facts weren’t false, Conway said, just “alternative.” Two months before that interview, in November 2016, Oxford Dictionaries declared “post-truth” the word of the year. Trump’s first presidential campaign and the global ascendancy of the far right had sparked a pervading interest in fake news, disinformation and the political utility of truth-telling in a world shaped by algorithmic forces. Pundits grappled with the realization that social media’s prime role in disseminating news now meant that quick reactions — the stronger the better — would take precedence over thoughtful engagement. If Trump had a first term marked by “alternative facts,” his second has demonstrated an outright hostility to anything resembling truth at all: Yes, there are the classic Trump lies (like his ludicrous claim that diversity, equity and inclusion programs are making planes fall out of the sky), but there’s also his administration’s brazen purge of health and climate data — an assault on foundational scientific knowledge that archivists have scrambled to preserve. Trump has also ordered $4 billion in cuts to National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants used to fund critical research at universities, cancer centers and hospitals. A federal judge temporarily blocked Trump’s order on Tuesday, but medical researchers have warned that, if implemented, the cuts could hamstring efforts to cure cancer and chronic health conditions, rendering scientific breakthroughs unobtainable. And then Trump has made ridiculous statements like this: “We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas,” he told reporters last month during a signing ceremony for the Laken Riley Act . The baseless claim, first promoted by Elon Musk and his “ Department of Government Efficiency ” (DOGE), seems in fact to be referencing an $83.5 million payment to support HIV prevention and treatment efforts in the East African country of Mozambique, whose Gaza province is unrelated to the Gaza Strip in the Middle East. The nongovernmental organization that received the funds, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, said none of the money was used to acquire condoms. This is a far cry from the eye-catching headlines about rash government spending on “ explosive condoms ” for Hamas. But even the use of government funds to purchase contraceptives is not particularly notable; the U.S. Agency for International Development has worked on global HIV prevention efforts for decades. On Tuesday, Musk finally walked back the White House’s claim, telling reporters , “Some of the things that I say will be incorrect.” It’s a chilling acknowledgement — no more lip service will be paid to the pursuit of truth, just expect and accept a steady stream of falsities from those in power. While Musk tacked on a note that DOGE’s incorrect statements “should be corrected,” he knows it doesn’t matter. The $50 million condom claim already went viral across social media and conservative news networks; now that it’s lodged in the brains of countless Trump supporters, it’s unlikely that a belated press briefing will change anyone’s mind. Plus, Musk then added, “I’m not sure we should be sending $50 million worth of condoms to anywhere.” Again, we didn’t . And yet this flippant ignorance is also part of the new anti-truth paradigm, a weaponized, intentional “I’m just asking questions” attitude, crafted to obfuscate simple facts. Musk could, of course, choose to learn the details of global HIV prevention, why the U.S. does it, how public health efforts in Mozambique have a ripple effect on all of us. But why would he? The same ideological current runs through Trump’s gutting of medical research. The slashed NIH funds for researchers’ overhead costs boastfully disregards even considering why those costs might be necessary. And the impact on public health could be devastating. Take HIV prevention, for instance. U.S. health officials first became aware of AIDS in 1981, but it took four more years for then-President Ronald Reagan to speak about it publicly. By 1990, HIV was a leading cause of death for young people in the U.S.; more than 40 million people have died from HIV globally. But today, for many in the U.S., the HIV/AIDS epidemic now feels like it’s in the rearview mirror. That’s thanks in large part to concerted efforts from activist groups like the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), which fought to expand the approval and availability of life-saving drugs. New HIV infections have declined since 1984 by an estimated 76 percent. ACT UP’s efforts set the government’s public health agenda, pushing for vital change from agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NIH. It is because of these efforts that we have federal funding for HIV prevention and treatment in the first place — the same funding now being cut or placed on pause . But the epidemic is not over, certainly not globally, and also not in the U.S. “Especially here in New York City where the HIV epidemic really started, there’s been a lot of investment to get that last little bit to end the epidemic in recent years,” Jason Zucker, an adult and pediatric infectious disease physician at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, told me. “If we want to end the epidemic, it’s going to be really hard. You have to increase your efforts to increase testing and identify every person living with HIV, so you can try to spend additional time and effort linking them to care and getting them on treatment, because undetectable equals untransmittable.” The second Trump presidency has made that battle all the more difficult. I spoke with Zucker before Trump announced the cuts to NIH funding, but after he had ordered a freeze on the disbursement of all federal funds. While that freeze was also temporarily halted by a federal judge, courts ruled Trump has been defying the judge’s order. And as part of Trump’s ban on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and “gender ideology,” his administration has continued to scour grants for any mention of words that could be loosely construed as relating to DEI — which in practice has spanned a range of topics, even flagging words like “diversity” and “women” for review. Zucker noted that Trump’s multipronged attacks “will really impact our ability to bring the epidemic to a close like had been planned.” Public health, we know, is not a priority of the Trump administration. Five years ago, the Trump administration failed to respond to the emergence of COVID-19 in a timely or effective manner. The global pandemic sparked a new wave of vaccine denialism and a crumbling of trust in our government’s health agencies — trust that won’t be restored with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a noted vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist , at the helm of the Health and Human Services Department. The CDC botched its public health guidance, first under Trump, and then continued to sow confusion under President Joe Biden’s administration, shifting the onus of responsibility for public health from the state to individuals . Trump’s attacks on medical research, federal funding, and access to health and climate data are the logical outgrowth of the post-truth seeds first planted in 2016 and watered during the COVID-19 pandemic. And while the media focus has been on the consequences for scientific research, Zucker emphasized to me that the biggest impacts will be on treatment. “The whole point of research is to give us better methods of caring for people,” Zucker said. “I say that as someone who’s primarily a researcher: My work doesn’t matter if I can’t translate that into providing better care.”
Elon Musk has made numerous unverified and false claims that his DOGE project has unearthed “fraud.” The official government website for Elon Musk’s so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” was easily hacked, as its source code included ways to breach its web pages. The breaches by at least two individuals showcase the recklessness with which DOGE has been ripping through federal agencies and departments. Since President Donald Trump created DOGE through a legally dubious executive order, it has placed unlawful spending freezes on various programs that don’t align with the president’s far right agenda. It has also furloughed thousands of federal workers, ostensibly to cut wasteful spending and weed out supposed “fraud” within the government. DOGE.gov was created only after Musk was questioned by reporters about where the public could scrutinize DOGE’s work. Musk responded by saying it was being documented on a DOGE account on X as well as on an official government website , which was blank at the time Musk first referenced it. On Friday, tech website 404 Media reported that the government website could be edited by virtually anyone , as its source code — accessible on most websites through a right-click within a web browser — enabled people to make modifications to it. Two sources shared with 404 Media just how easy it was to change the website. One of those sources reportedly made alterations to the site themselves . At least two changes have been documented. In one instance, the site was changed to read, “THESE ‘EXPERTS’ LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN.” The other instance was also critical of the operation — “This is a joke of a .gov site,” that person wrote on DOGE.gov. “Feels like it was completely slapped together. Tons of errors and details leaked in the page source code,” one of the sources told 404 Media . New from 404 Media: anyone can push updates to the site. Two sources independently found the issue, one made their own decision to deface the site. "THESE 'EXPERTS' LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN." pic.twitter.com/Tk81I1qk9E In addition to DOGE.gov’s poor security, observers have criticized its unprofessional appearance and the fact that it does not showcase any of DOGE’s actual work in detail. “This will be unsurprising to anyone who has visited the DOGE.gov website since its inception — it looks like a high schooler could’ve made it,” The New Republic’s Malcolm Ferguson wrote . The site is “little more than a glorified feed of posts from the official DOGE account on Musk’s own X platform, raising new questions about Musk’s conflicts of interest in running DOGE,” Wired’s David Gilbert observed . The site has promised to publish supposed “savings” it has made by freezing government spending, pledging to do so “no later than Valentine’s day.” As of noon Eastern Time, those savings have yet to be published. The site also has a page called the “Unconstitutionality Index,” which, through its title, attempts to show that the rulemaking ability of government agencies outpaces the number of laws for those agencies, insinuating that is a sign of actions outside their authority under the U.S. Constitution. However, agency rulemaking isn’t unconstitutional if it’s performed in a manner authorized by Congress — when such laws are passed, they legally empower agencies to regulate, which inherently means there will be many more rules than there are laws. Daily Beast reporter Sean Craig has also pointed out that this “index” wasn’t created by DOGE, but rather is an analysis by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank. Both Musk and President Donald Trump have suggested that DOGE has uncovered multiple instances of “fraud.” But they have failed to provide actual examples, pointing to examples of legal government spending that they disagree with instead. This spending was authorized by Congress and signed into law by presidential administrations, including likely during Trump’s first term. Among those who have pointed out that DOGE’s claims of fraud are incorrect are federal judges who have placed holds on DOGE’s spending freezes. “The Defendants now plea that they are just trying to root out fraud” through DOGE’s work, U.S. District Judge John McConnell wrote in an order earlier this week . “But the freezes in effect now were a result of the broad categorical order, not a specific finding of possible fraud.” U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols — a judicial appointee of Trump’s — also noted that lawyers for the government couldn’t justify putting 2,000 federal workers on leave “beyond asserting without any record support that USAID writ large was possibly engaging in ‘corruption and fraud.’” DOGE’s work itself is highly circumspect, especially Musk’s involvement in government affairs. Musk has reportedly received “special government employee” status from the Trump administration. That designation requires that individuals do not oversee matters in which they have a financial stake — a requirement that Musk is clearly flouting, as he has billions of dollars in government contracts and his role at DOGE grants him oversight over agencies that have previously investigated his companies . At least three staffers on Musk’s DOGE team have faced widespread backlash after investigations into their online footprints uncovered posts promoting racism, white nationalism, and violence against women. The first staffer to make headlines, Marko Elez, resigned from DOGE after his racist posts were made public. But after Vice President J.D. Vance and Trump came to his defense, Musk reinstated Elez to his position.
The impact of “Citizens United” is clearer than ever with Elon Musk buying his way into power, Pramila Jayapal said. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington) introduced a constitutional amendment to reverse Citizens United on Thursday, as an out-of-control billionaire informally appointed by President Donald Trump has set out to destroy the federal government in the wake of the most expensive election in U.S. history . The amendment would reverse the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision to give corporations, dark money groups and the wealthy the ability to spend unlimited amounts to influence elections, unleashing a deluge of money and undue influence on politics. This funding is instrumental in deciding elections, with data showing that the vast majority of federal elections are decided by which candidate spent more. The impact of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission becomes increasingly prominent each election cycle , with more and more money being flooded into elections, drowning out individuals’ voices. This year, its effect is clearer than ever, with Elon Musk, an unelected official, slashing federal agencies and controlling federal spending seemingly without oversight. Jayapal, who has previously introduced legislation to reverse the decision, called out Musk in introducing the amendment. “Corporations are not people and money is not speech,” said Jayapal. “In every election cycle since the disastrous Citizens United decision, we have seen more and more special interest dark money poured into campaigns across the country — this year, with a billionaire paying millions to buy a seat as Shadow President.” A release by Jayapal’s office says that the amendment disposes of the establishment of corporate personhood, specifying that only people have Constitutional rights — targeting the root of the Citizens United decision, which asserts that limiting outside groups’ ability to spend on elections is a violation of First Amendment rights. It also mandates that election contributions be publicly disclosed at all levels of government. The legislation, known as the “We the People Amendment,” is cosponsored by 28 lawmakers, including progressives like Representatives Summer Lee (D-Pennsylvania) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan). It was Citizens United that allowed Musk, the richest man in the world, to spend at least a quarter of a billion dollars on electing Trump this November. Federal election filings have shown that Musk gave $260 million to Super PACs backing Trump and his fascist agenda.. Seemingly in return, Trump hired Musk as a “special government employee” to act as the head of the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) — a position and entity with questionable legal jurisdiction within an administration which appears to have no respect for the law or the judiciary. A host of other billionaires, including several key figures in Big Tech , were also instrumental in funding Trump’s win. Musk has already made back his investment nearly 600-fold, with his wealth having ballooned by $154 billion since election day. Some commentators have outright said that Citizens United paved the way for Musk to be in his position of power, with the outsized role of money in politics incentivizing politicians, Democrat and Republican, to pander to corporate elites rather than work for the people.
Musk inserted himself into Germany's elections in December, when he endorsed the far right Alternative for Germany. The head of the political party likely to win Germany’s parliamentary elections later this month has criticized billionaire Elon Musk for his interference in German elections, stating that there will likely be consequences for the billionaire’s promotion of the neo-Nazi political party Alternative for Germany (AfD). Friedrich Merz, himself a conservative, is the leader of the right-wing Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the party currently ahead in the polls. Although Merz has consistently staked out far right anti-immigration views, his party, like other traditional German political parties, has stated that it will not form a coalition government with AfD , even though AfD is currently in second place. Late last year, Musk officially endorsed AfD . That party’s leaders have campaigned on vehemently anti-immigrant policies and have repeatedly spewed antisemitic rhetoric, including downplaying or outright denying the Holocaust. In an X post on Wednesday , Merz, referencing Musk specifically, said, “What happened in this election campaign cannot go unchallenged.” Merz added that there will either be a “political” or “legal” response to Musk’s involvement in the elections. “I want to analyze this calmly after this election campaign,” Merz said. Merz’s response to Musk — and how the German government, under his party’s watch, may react to the billionaire in the coming months — is a stark departure from Musk’s warm reception from right-wing lawmakers in the United States. Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration, Musk’s so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) — which exists only through a legally questionable executive order — has ripped through federal departments and agencies, furloughing and firing public sector workers, freezing grants and funding for various projects, and accessing sensitive data of millions of Americans, including the payment systems within the Treasury Department. With a Republican Congress unwilling to challenge the executive branch’s allowance of such actions, the most viable option for stopping DOGE in its tracks appears to be injunctions from judges within the judicial branch — which some Republicans have suggested Trump should ignore , a move that could potentially spark a constitutional crisis. Musk, who is listed as a “special government employee” by the Trump administration , is legally obligated to avoid conflicts of interest within his work. But there are clear examples of him flouting such precautions — including the DOGE team essentially shutting down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has been investigating complaints against Musk’s companies. Meanwhile, it appears as though Tesla, Musk’s electric vehicle company, is set to receive around $400 million in State Department contracts to produce armored electric trucks for government officials. Tesla was reported as likely to receive the contract as far back as December — but the impending contract has faced increased scrutiny this week as Musk’s DOGE team has made headlines. Late Wednesday evening, the State Department removed the word “Tesla” from the potential contract, prompting Musk to call at least one of the reports on the contract a “lie” — even though it’s clear that Tesla is the most likely candidate to produce the vehicles being sought. Polling shows that, as Musk’s influence on the federal government continues, Americans are increasingly skeptical of his role. A recent Economist /YouGov poll , for example, shows that voters are split on whether they want Musk to have influence on how the government functions, with 44 percent saying they want him to have “a lot” or “a little” influence, and 45 percent saying they don’t want him to have influence at all. Furthermore, Americans have a net-negative view of Musk’s work so far, with a plurality (47 percent) saying they disapprove of his role in government, and just 38 percent saying they approve.
Trump is making real the words of OMB director Russell Vought, who said “we are living in a post-Constitutional time.” No sooner did Donald Trump take the oath of office than he immediately took a wrecking ball to government agencies and programs that protect nearly every aspect of Americans’ lives. States, public interest organizations, schools, doctors, unions, immigrants, federal workers and individuals have filed more than 60 lawsuits challenging Trump’s legal authority to take these actions. At least nine judges throughout the country have temporarily halted several of them. Courts have put temporary holds on Trump’s attempts to: end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, freeze billions of dollars in federal spending appropriated by Congress, transfer incarcerated transgender women to men’s prisons, remove scientific data from the websites of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, give his de facto co-president Elon Musk unfettered access to sensitive Treasury Department records, and put 2,200 United States Agency for International Development (USAID) employees on leave. One federal judge, George A. O’Toole, who had temporarily paused the Trump administration’s federal worker buyout program, lifted the stay because he found that the plaintiffs — unions who represent over 800,000 federal workers — didn’t have standing to sue, which means they weren’t directly harmed. Known as “Fork in the Road,” the program provided federal workers an incentive to resign with the promise of pay through September 30. About 75,000 workers have already taken the deal. After O’Toole’s ruling, Trump discontinued the program. The White House alleged that rulings against the administration were made by “judicial activists” and their decisions constitute a “constitutional crisis.” But it is Trump’s noncompliance with some of those court orders that is threatening to end the rule of law in the U.S. On January 31, John J. McConnell Jr., chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) prohibiting the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) from freezing federal funding and refusing to resume disbursements of congressionally appropriated federal funds. Nevertheless, officials in the administration continued to improperly freeze federal funds and refused to continue disbursing funds that had been appropriated. When he issued the TRO, McConnell wrote, “The Defendants now claim that this matter is moot because it rescinded the OMB Directive. But the evidence shows that the alleged rescission of the OMB Directive was in name-only and may have been issued simply to defeat the jurisdiction of the courts.” The 23 Democratic attorneys general who brought the original lawsuit in Rhode Island federal court against Trump and several of his officials filed a motion for enforcement of the temporary restraining order. On February 10, McConnell granted the plaintiffs’ motion and ordered the defendants to immediately do the following: restore frozen funding, end any federal funding pause, clear any hurdles to implementation, comply with the plain text of the TRO, restore withheld funds (including those appropriated in the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Improvement and Jobs Act), and resume funding of institutes and other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health. Judge McConnell began his order with this language from the 1975 Supreme Court decision in Maness v. Meyers : basic proposition that all orders and judgments of courts must be complied with promptly …. Persons who make private determinations of the law and refuse to obey an order generally risk criminal contempt even if the order is ultimately ruled incorrect. The orderly and expeditious administration of justice by the courts requires that an order issued by a court with jurisdiction over the subject matter and person must be obeyed by the parties until it is reversed by orderly and proper proceedings. McConnell referred to the “plain language of the TRO” and noted that “The Defendants acknowledged that they understood what the TRO required.” “It’s very rare for a president not to comply with an order,” Victoria Nourse, director of the Georgetown Law Center on Congress and Democracy, told The New York Times . “This is part of a pattern where President Trump appears to be asserting authority that he doesn’t have.” It is also unusual for a court to accuse a party of not following its ruling, retired federal judge Nancy Gertner said on NPR ’s “Morning Edition.” On February 10, plaintiffs in another lawsuit said the Trump administration was continuing to place employees of USAID on administrative leave, notwithstanding a court order that they stop. Officials in the Trump administration are signaling their intention to disobey judicial rulings with which they disagree. The legal way to challenge an adverse judicial ruling is not to disobey it or impeach the judge who issued it. It’s to file an appeal with a higher court. “Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power,” Vice President J.D. Vance posted on X, attacking an order by U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer that Musk and his young muskrats at the “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) could not have access to the Treasury Department’s vital payment systems containing sensitive data. Implicit in Vance’s declaration is that the president decides whether the power he is exercising is legitimate. Trump echoed Vance’s condemnation: “No judge should frankly be allowed to make that kind of a decision. It’s a disgrace.” “Vance’s arguments, if one can call them that, are entirely without merit and sound to me like strong hints that the White House and its Musk contingent are planning to ignore court rulings that they find inconvenient or that they see as hostile to their takeover agenda,” Laurence Tribe, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, told NBC News . Musk also slammed Engelmayer. “A corrupt judge protecting corruption. He needs to be impeached NOW!” Musk posted on X. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) called Engelmayer’s ruling “outrageous” and wrote on X, “This outlaw should be reversed immediately and Engelmayer should be forbidden by higher courts from ever hearing another case against the Trump admin.” Rep. Darrell Issa (R-California) pledged to introduce legislation to “stop these rogue judges and allow Trump and DOGE to tell you where the government is spending your money.” Congress, however, has shown little appetite for reining in the worst excesses of Trump’s blitz. The legal way to challenge an adverse judicial ruling is not to disobey it or impeach the judge who issued it. It’s to file an appeal with a higher court. The Supreme Court established the principle of judicial review in the 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison . “It is emphatically the duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is,” the court said. The holding rested on the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers based on three co-equal branches of government — legislative, executive and judicial. “There’s no point in separating the judicial from the executive if the executive can just ignore what the courts have decided,” said Saikrishna Prakash, a law professor at the University of Virginia. It is the legislative branch that has always decided how to structure the executive branch by establishing federal agencies and appropriating money to fund them. But consistent with Project 2025’s goal of “ deconstruction of the administrative state ,” Trump has effectively shuttered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and USAID. He has defanged the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. He’s also moving to abolish the Department of Education. The Constitution says that the president has a duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” But Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and chief architect of Project 2025, said in 2022 that we are living in a “post-Constitutional time.” Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan warns of a constitutional crisis “when the president of the United States doesn’t care what the Constitution says.” Although presidents have engaged in unconstitutional acts, “I never had the sense that there was a president for whom the Constitution was essentially meaningless,” she told The New York Times . In his December 2024 year-end report, Chief Justice John Roberts noted that in the past few years, elected officials on both sides of the aisle have “raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings.” He declared, “These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected.” But Karlan is worried that the Supreme Court might uphold Trump’s actions because he would ignore their adverse rulings. “The idea that courts should preserve the illusion of power by abdicating their responsibilities would just make the constitutional crisis even worse,” she warned. In 1953, Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson said that the power of the high court is that it gets the last word in legal disputes. “We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final,” he wrote in Brown v. Allen . If a party disobeys a court order, the judge can hold them in contempt, impose fines and even imprison them. The marshals would be charged with enforcing a custodial order. But the Marshal Service is part of Trump’s Department of Justice, and he would likely order them not to comply. “At that point, you have a full-on constitutional crisis,” former Judge Gertner said.
Journalist Eric Lipton discusses Trump and his allies’ cryptocurrency schemes, Elon Musk’s operations, and more. How is Elon Musk personally benefiting from his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency? The agency, known as DOGE, is tasked with slashing “trillions” of dollars in federal spending and has set its sights on regulatory agencies, including ones that have opened investigations into Musk’s business practices. “At a minimum, it’s an appearance of conflict of interest,” says journalist Eric Lipton, who is investigating Musk and DOGE for The New York Times . Musk’s business empire is a major beneficiary of government contracts, says Lipton, and “all of the disruption that is happening across the federal government has benefited his operations.” Lipton also discusses Trump and his allies’ cryptocurrency schemes and the Trump family’s investments in the Middle East. This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Drop Site News has revealed that procurement plans from the State Department include some $400 million to buy new Tesla armored Cybertrucks. This comes as Tesla owner and the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is already one of the biggest beneficiaries of U.S. government contracts and is now also the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, tasked with slashing the federal budget and firing thousands. On Wednesday, the newly created House DOGE subcommittee held its first meeting, chaired by Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene. Elon Musk did not testify as Democrats blasted Republicans for giving him free rein to dismantle government agencies. This is Democratic Congressmember Robert Garcia. REP. ROBERT GARCIA: This entire plan is about hurting the American social safety net and destroying our institutions. And it’s important that we actually call out what is happening at this subcommittee. This is not about working with the richest man on the planet. This is actually about empowering — this committee wants to empower the richest person in the world to hurt people, so they can take all of this money, that they so-called want to save, and then give it to themselves, their companies and their billionaire friends. NERMEEN SHAIKH: Congressional Democrats have also called on officials to, quote, “uphold federal ethics laws in relation to Elon Musk’s role as a special government employee.” On Tuesday, Elon Musk spoke to reporters from the Oval Office, standing alongside President Trump, who remained seated at the Resolute Desk. It was the first time Musk took questions about his DOGE operation. REPORTER: Mr. Musk, the White House says that you will identify and excuse yourself from any conflicts of interest that you may have. Does that mean that you are, in effect, policing yourself? What are the checks and balances that are in place to ensure that there is accountability and transparency? ELON MUSK: Well, we actually are trying to be as transparent as possible. In fact, our actions — we post our actions to the DOGE handle on X and to the DOGE website. So, all of our actions are maximally transparent. In fact, I don’t think there’s been — I don’t know of a case where an organization has been more transparent than the DOGE organization. AMY GOODMAN: For more, we’re joined by Eric Lipton, three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, investigative reporter at The New York Times , part of a team investigating Elon Musk’s business with the federal government. His latest piece , “Elon Musk’s Business Empire Scores Benefits Under Trump Shake-Up.” Eric, welcome back to Democracy Now! Why don’t you lay out the agencies that Elon Musk has gone after — the wealthiest man in the world — and also the fact that these are the very agencies that have been investigating him, whether we’re talking about the NLRB or the EEOC, whether we’re talking about the FAA or fining him or talking about the Consumer Protection Board, all of this? ERIC LIPTON: Right. I mean, what we examined was the fact that Elon Musk, as you said, is one of the largest contractors that the federal government has. He’s received, you know, over $15 billion worth of contractual obligations from the federal government in the last decade, $3.8 billion just in 2024. The bulk of that comes from the Department of Defense and NASA, because he is launching almost everything they put up into orbit — spy satellites, astronauts, cargo, communication satellites. And so, you know, at the same time, he is also the subject of dozens of distinct investigations and lawsuits and complaints that the federal government agencies are handling, from across the landscape. Just about every acronym you can come up with, they’ve got some investigation of him. And so, for example, the Federal Aviation Administration is simultaneously currently examining the recent explosion of the Starship rocket that blew up and sent debris coming down over the Caribbean last month, and the planes had to get out of the way, or else they would have been struck by falling debris as that rocket blew up. And they’re also examining whether or not to allow SpaceX’s Starship to launch 25 times a year out of Boca Chica in South Texas near the Mexican border. And they’re also looking at the damage that those launches are having to the wildlife in this adjacent wildlife refuge. I was there in June of 2024 during one of the launches and then walked the area nearby and saw, you know, various eggs that were destroyed, from threatened species of birds, that had been blown up by the debris that was sent out by the rocket. And there was an investigation of that. So, all these things are ongoing. So, the guy, at the same time, has billions of dollars of pending contracts. He’s got all of these investigations. And now he’s been tasked by Trump to look into the FAA, to look into the Department of Defense. And so, that creates — at a minimum, it’s an appearance of conflict of interest. And the open question is: What role is he playing in potentially putting restraints on some of the same regulators that are investigating him? And we do not have transparency into that. Despite what he said, it is not a transparent operation. It is incredibly hard to see into it. And all we know is that there is this overlap between the things that he interacts with the government on as a private businessman and the things he’s doing as a special government employee. NERMEEN SHAIKH: And, Eric, could you explain? There are something like 24 ongoing investigations by the National Labor Relations Board into Musk’s companies. If you could elaborate on that a little? ERIC LIPTON: Yeah. So, when Musk bought Twitter and was in the process of basically, you know, reducing and/or significantly cutting its staff, there was some criticism of his actions. And there was some of the — there were some allegations by employees there that he was — that the company was snooping on employees and mistreating the employees and improperly dismissing the employees, and there were complaints that were filed with the National Labor Relations Board. And there are many complaints. And the NLRB, as it’s called, is an entity that Elon Musk does not even think constitutionally should exist. He’s sued to try to get rid of it. And so, the NLRB now has lost its quorum, because Trump removed some members of the staff and a member of the board. And so, effectively, it is now in a static state. So, in all of these cases that we examined, in more than 10 different federal agencies, we did not find a situation where Musk himself used his power at DOGE to fire or to stop an investigation of himself. But what we did find was that all of the disruption that is happening across the federal government has benefited his operations, to the extent that there are investigations that have been stalled, or there are quorums on oversight bodies that no longer exist, or the chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission, for example, Trump fired, and the FEC was investigating whether or not Musk had made illegal campaign contributions and had an illegal — you know, essentially, a lottery or a sweepstakes during the election, giving out a million dollars to people who were registering to vote. So, what we found was this overlap between changes that have occurred and investigations that were targeting Musk and his operations. AMY GOODMAN: And explain how it works. How is it possible that he does not have to be investigated or signed off on conflict of interest agreements, that we don’t know what these conflicts of interest are, and yet he has this enormous power? People are now calling him the “X president,” not in terms of past, but the letter “X.” ERIC LIPTON: Yeah, I mean, you know, normally, if you’re a federal government employee, you can’t have a contract with the federal government. And also, if you’re a federal government employee, you are prohibited, under criminal law, from taking any action that could, on a particular matter — so, it can be a general policy, but on a specific matter — that directly impacts your family or yourself financially. And that’s a criminal offense if you do that. And so, a special government employee, which Musk is, means that you are essentially a private person who’s not a full-time employee, but you’re advising the government, but your role is significant enough that you actually have this status as special government employee. And SGEs, as they’re known, are actually subject to the same federal conflict of interest criminal law. So he is prohibited, under federal criminal law, from taking any action, specific action, that can benefit himself. Now, but there is a waiver process. A waiver can be granted to a person who’s a special government employee that effectively allows them to take actions that benefit themselves. We’ve asked the White House if such a waiver has been granted to him. The answer that we got earlier this week is that Musk is filling out his financial disclosure report, because as a special government employee, you’re required to fill out a financial disclosure report, which details all of your financial holdings. And what happens then is, then, the ethics lawyer reviews that document and then evaluates where your conflicts of interest emerge, based on your holdings, and then they write up what’s called an ethics letter. And the ethics letter says, “You must recuse from this, this, this and this, or else you will have a conflict of interest.” And it’s only after the ethics letter exists that typically you get a waiver. So, that would suggest he doesn’t yet have a waiver, because he’s just filling out the financial disclosure report. And they also told us that that financial disclosure report is not going to be made public, which is actually allowed under law if you’re a special government employee and you’re not paid. It is a confidential financial disclosure report. So, that’s a long answer for: We don’t really have a basis of evaluating if he’s doing things that violate the conflict of interest law, because we don’t know what the ethics letter, the limits that it sets, and we can’t even evaluate if he’s honoring the ethics letter, because it doesn’t appear as if the ethics letter exists yet. NERMEEN SHAIKH: So, Eric, we want to go to the other reporting that you’ve done on the Trump memecoin in an article headlined “Early Crypto Traders Had Speedy Profit on Trump Coin as Others Suffered Losses.” Could you lay out what you found in that piece? ERIC LIPTON: Yeah, this is an entirely separate line of reporting. It’s been an incredibly busy period since Trump went into office, working crazy hours and seven days a week trying to try to examine so many different things that are happening simultaneously. But my colleague David Yaffe-Bellany and I have written three or four articles now about the Trump memecoin, which was introduced on January 17th at 9 p.m., at the same moment that a bunch of cryptocurrency executives were gathering in Washington for what they call the Crypto Ball. And what we were really particularly interested on was how is the Trump family profiting from this new cryptocurrency memecoin, and who is making money and who is losing money. And we spent two weeks really digging into that, while we were working on other stories, and trying to gather the data based on examining the blockchain, which records every single transaction, every purchase and every sale, and looking at who the winners and losers were by looking at their wallets. And what we found was that more than 800,000 people that followed Trump’s advice lost more than a billion dollars. And at the same time, the Trump family and its partners have made more than $100 million in transaction fees. And there are other traders who got in really quickly, who know what a memecoin is all about, which is a speculative, sort of worthless platform — you know, it has no inherent value. It’s just a speculative vehicle. And these really sophisticated traders instantly purchased large amounts of the Trump memecoin, and then they sold it just as the retail traders, the fans of Trump who were sort of, you know, just getting onto their computers and more slowly purchasing them — those retail buyers became, effectively, the liquidity for the sophisticated seller, that then was selling to them, and they were buying those tokens. And so, the short answer is that a certain small group of people made enormous profits, but hundreds of thousands of people that followed Trump’s advice lost money. And the Trump family is walking away, and its partners, with more than $100 million simply in fees. And so, you know, you sort of wonder, you know, “Who benefited in that situation?” And it is not, clearly, the people that follow Trump. AMY GOODMAN: And finally, Eric, we just have a minute, but another piece that you wrote, “What to Know About the Trump Family’s Deals in the Middle East.” ERIC LIPTON: Yes, busy times. So, yes, we were also examining how — the Trump family, during the first term, limited its new international deals. They’re not doing that now. They’re doing a bunch of deals with, in particular, a Saudi Arabian company called Dar Al Arkan. They’ve got a deal in Dubai and two in Saudi Arabia, one in Oman. And so, they are moving full steam ahead on new international deals, and, in fact, even on deals, for example, in Serbia, in Belgrade, that the government of Serbia owns the land. So, Trump is both setting foreign policy relative to Serbia at the same time as his family is going to be building a hotel on government-owned land. You know, that’s a conflict of interest right there. AMY GOODMAN: And, of course, there’s Ivanka and Jared Kushner in Albania, and Jared Kushner, of course, getting $2 billion from Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia. ERIC LIPTON: Yeah, a lot to write about. We are very busy right now, and I hope that you’re reading these stories. I mean, you know, accountability matters, but it’s important that you take the time to read these stories, that you share these stories. You know, just writing into a vacuum doesn’t make a difference. AMY GOODMAN: Eric Lipton, thanks so much for being with us, three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, investigative reporter at The New York Times , investigating Elon Musk’s business with the federal government.

House Republicans’ draft budget calls for $2 trillion in cuts to federal nutrition assistance and other programs. House Republicans unveiled a draft budget resolution on Wednesday that calls for $4.5 trillion in tax breaks that would disproportionately benefit the wealthy while proposing $2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, federal nutrition assistance, and other programs. Lawmakers are set to mark up the House GOP’s budget blueprint on Thursday as Republicans look to craft a sprawling reconciliation bill that can pass both chambers of Congress with a simple-majority vote. Last week, Senate Republicans released their own budget resolution that proposed significant cuts to Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and other spending that benefits working-class families. “Instead of tackling rising prices and delivering relief for American families, House Republicans are charging ahead with trillions of dollars in deeply unpopular tax breaks for billionaires like Donald Trump and Elon Musk ,” Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collaborative , said Wednesday in response to the House GOP resolution. “And, they’re paying for their billionaire handouts by ransacking healthcare, food assistance, and other vital programs that American workers and families rely on,” Jacquez added. The new resolution released by the Republican-controlled House Budget Committee specifically calls on the chamber’s energy and commerce panel to “submit changes in laws within its jurisdiction to reduce the deficit by not less than” $880 billion over the next decade. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over Medicaid. The measure also instructs the House Committee on Agriculture, which has jurisdiction over SNAP, to cut no less than $230 billion in spending between fiscal years 2025 and 2034. “They wanna do a giant tax cut that disproportionately helps the rich while taking away people’s health insurance and food while still adding trillions to the debt,” Bobby Kogan, a former Senate Budget Committee staffer who is now senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, wrote in response to the resolution. House Republicans just released their budget resolution – which keys up their reconciliation bills, which can avoid a filibuster and be passed with a simple majority. This is VERY real. They are calling to cut Medicaid by AT LEAST $880 billion, and to cut SNAP by AT LEAST 20%. pic.twitter.com/4voFun3RTh — Bobby Kogan (@BBKogan) February 12, 2025 House Republicans just released their budget resolution – which keys up their reconciliation bills, which can avoid a filibuster and be passed with a simple majority. This is VERY real. They are calling to cut Medicaid by AT LEAST $880 billion, and to cut SNAP by AT LEAST 20%. pic.twitter.com/4voFun3RTh Overall, the House GOP’s budget resolution calls for $2 trillion in cuts to “mandatory spending” over the next decade, taking aim at a category that includes Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and SNAP. While Social Security benefits cannot be cut through the reconciliation process, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) can . Congressional Republicans have outlined a number of ways they could slash Medicaid and SNAP, including punitive new work requirements that analysts say would strip benefits from tens of millions of low-income people. But Families USA executive director Anthony Wright said Wednesday that “we don’t need to know the mechanisms of how Medicaid would be cut to know the impact would be catastrophic: The sheer size of the proposed cuts means millions of Americans losing coverage, hospitals and clinics plunged into budget shortfalls, and healthcare services we all depend on being eliminated.” “This budget resolution is a five-alarm fire alert for our healthcare,” said Wright. “House Republican leadership put a giant bullseye on Medicaid, with the intent to strip Americans of their healthcare benefits to pay for tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations.” Kobie Christian, a spokesperson for the progressive coalition Unrig Our Economy, issued a similarly scathing statement on Wednesday, arguing that House Republicans “showed us that what they value is more tax breaks for greedy billionaires and giant corporations with everyday people paying the price.” “At a time when everyday Americans face increasingly higher prices , Speaker Johnson and his stooges want to write billionaires a check and force working-class people to foot the bill for their outrageous tax breaks for corporations and the ultra-wealthy,” said Christian. “Everyday Americans will not stand for these games — it’s time for Republicans in Congress to end their campaign that puts the ultra-wealthy first on the backs of the rest of us.”
When we see a parallel government taking shape, we should not refrain from calling fascism what it is. I have to admit, I thought it would take more than a few short weeks for the richest man on Earth to expose U.S. democracy as little more than a paper tiger. We have checks and balances, after all — the separation of powers, due process, a centuries-old Constitution — all no match, apparently, for “special government employee” Elon Musk and his brood of near-adolescent lackeys at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). With the speed of a self-driving Tesla crashing into oncoming traffic, Musk’s DOGE has run roughshod over federal bureaucracy, gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), canceling close to $1 billion in Education Department contracts and promoting mass buyouts for government workers. In the process, DOGE employees have reportedly breached U.S. taxpayer records and accessed sensitive student loan data; one team member was even “briefly” and “ mistakenly ” given the ability to edit the Treasury’s federal payment systems. Musk, of course, is not an elected official. He has not received congressional approval to reshape the federal government, and his authority has been granted by President Donald Trump alone. But on Tuesday, Trump signed a decree granting Musk even more power: The heads of federal agencies must now receive DOGE approval before making new hires. Many of the actions by Musk and the rest of Trump’s administration have already received significant legal pushback: Labor unions, Doctors for America, dozens of religious congregations, the American Civil Liberties Union and attorneys general from 22 states are among the groups that have sued. Legal experts and sitting senators say DOGE’s blitzkrieg is unconstitutional, and federal judges , for the most part, have agreed. Court orders have temporarily blocked the federal funding freeze, Trump’s rescindment of birthright citizenship, Musk’s dismantling of USAID and DOGE staffers’ access to Treasury systems. But concerns are mounting over whether these legal measures will be enough to stop the Trump-Musk wrecking ball. The day before Trump bolstered DOGE’s workforce oversight a federal judge ruled that the president had defied orders to restart the flow of federal funds. That ruling sparked articles with headlines like “ What happens if Trump starts ignoring court rulings ?” and “ Here’s what federal judges could do if they’re ignored by the Trump administration .” (The answer, it seems, is not much.) Trump insists that this is what voters wanted when they reelected him in November, and he says that Musk — who shelled out more than $250 million to help him win his presidential campaign — was always part of the deal. But while Trump’s approval rating hovers above 50 percent in a new poll , only about a quarter of Republicans have said they think Musk should have “a lot” of influence over government operations. Still, Musk has been granted far-reaching authority, and it could ultimately serve his own financial interests. Musk-led companies hold billions of dollars in government contracts and have been the subject of at least 20 federal investigations . The inspector general of USAID — the agency Musk just moved to destroy — was leading at least one of them, looking into the use of Starlink satellites in the war in Ukraine. Neuralink, Musk’s brain computer chip company, is under investigation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Agriculture after 1,500 animals died at company testing facilities. And Musk has promised to attack the Federal Aviation Administration, which launched an investigation into SpaceX after one of the company’s rocket ships exploded in January. In a Monday letter to the White House, Sen. Adam Schiff (D-California) demanded information about Musk’s conflicts of interest and ethical obligations. But if federal court orders can’t get Trump to bend the knee, a letter is unlikely to do the trick. Plus, the White House has already shared its foolproof plan: “If Elon Musk comes across a conflict of interest with the contracts and the funding that DOGE is overseeing,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on February 5, “then Elon will excuse himself from those contracts.” Oh, good, that clears things up. What could possibly go wrong? History may provide some answers. In his 2004 book, The Anatomy of Fascism , Robert Paxton, a political scientist and history professor at Columbia University, coined the terms “parallel state” and “parallel structures” to describe how authoritarians steadily exert dominion over state functions. “An outsider party that wants to claim power sets up organizations that replicate government agencies,” Paxton writes. “The fascist parties’ parallel structures challenged the liberal state by claiming that they were capable of doing some things better.… After achieving power, the party could substitute its parallel structures for those of the state.” The comparison is not 1:1, of course. Paxton cites Nazi Germany’s paramilitary force, party court, youth movement and separate foreign policy branch as examples of parallel organizations that supplanted traditional state agencies after the Nazis achieved power. Notably, Trump is already in power, and Musk’s takeover is not absolute. We have not seen the wholesale replacement of our federal agencies by an external body (yet). But Paxton’s historical analysis provides a useful framework when thinking about DOGE. After all, Paxton notes, “Hitler never formally abolished the constitution drafted in 1919 for the Weimar Republic, and never totally dismantled the normative state in Germany, though he himself refused to be bound by it.” Fascism need not announce itself with shiny gold horns and formal decrees. It can, and does, as we know, creep in slowly. When we see a parallel government taking shape, operating as the state’s shadow and pushing the outer limits of the law, we should take heed. If it looks like a fascist and talks like a fascist, well… Right now, we’re in a sort of pilot phase. The legal system is still there to contain Trump, but he’s seeing how far he can stretch and warp its bounds until it breaks. If Trump succeeds, brazenly shirks judges’ orders and pushes forward implementing all his heart’s desires — well, it’ll be the snap heard around the world. We can look again to history to see what could come next.
The move “plainly violates the First Amendment,” AP’s executive editor said. The Trump administration revoked Associated Press reporters’ access to a White House event this week after officials demanded that the publication change an editorial standard in compliance with a President Donald Trump order — a chilling instance of censorship that violates constitutional rights, the publication said. In a statement , AP Executive Editor Julie Pace said that the Trump administration blocked the publication from an Oval Office event and executive order signing on Tuesday. This was done in retaliation for the publication not complying with the Trump administration’s demand that it change its editorial standards to align with Trump’s order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to “Gulf of America.” The name change has not been recognized by other countries, including Mexico. “It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism,” Pace said. “Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP ’s speech not only severely impedes the public’s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment.” Later that day, the White House barred another AP reporter from an evening event in the White House’s Diplomatic Reception Room. An AP article on the incident called this “highly unusual.” Shortly after Trump signed the “Gulf of America” order on his first day in office, AP issued guidance saying that the publication “will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.” “Trump’s order only carries authority within the United States. Mexico, as well as other countries and international bodies, do not have to recognize the name change,” the publication said. “As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.” In the same notice, the publication said that it would be changing future references to Denali, in Alaska, to Mount McKinley, in compliance with a Trump order to erase the name used by Alaska Natives and to instead recognize President William McKinley. Trump signed an order on Tuesday directing agencies to comply with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as it hacks and slashes its way across the federal government. Musk was present at the signing. Access to these events allows press to report accurately on statements by officials, and to ask questions as officials make themselves available to journalists for comment. At the signing on Tuesday, for instance, Musk answered a number of questions about his role in the government as he conducts his administrative coup. The White House Correspondents’ Association raised alarm about the AP ban. “The White House cannot dictate how news organizations report the news, nor should it penalize working journalists because it is unhappy with their editors’ decision,” the group’s president, Eugene Daniels, said in a statement . “The move by the administration to bar a reporter from The Associated Press from an official event open to news coverage today is unacceptable.”
“Greedy billionaire trying to ripoff the American people pretending to be altruistic is all I see,” the lawmaker said. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota) has slammed billionaire Elon Musk for defending taxpayer funding for his own company after he has spent weeks eviscerating federal contracts for crucial services like health care and research. In a press conference in the Oval Office on Tuesday, a reporter asked Musk whether or not it would be considered a conflict of interest for Musk to look into contracts administered by the Department of Defense, which provides funding for SpaceX. Musk responded by saying that the contracts for his companies provide “value” for Americans, suggesting that the funding he has slashed as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — including funding for combating famine , education research, clinical trials for illnesses like cancer , and more — is wasteful. “First of all, I’m not the one filing the contract, it’s people at SpaceX,” he said, as though he doesn’t directly benefit from the contract regardless of the logistics of it being granted. “And I’d like to say, if you’ve seen where — where it was awarded to SpaceX and it wasn’t by far the best value for money for the taxpayer, let me know. Because every one of them was ,” Musk went on. Musk’s SpaceX and Tesla have received at least $18 billion in federal funding over the past decade. SpaceX’s contracts have grown in value in recent years, with the company receiving $3.7 billion in federal contracts in the 2024 fiscal year. Meanwhile, due in large part to taxpayer subsidies to his companies, Elon Musk has become the richest man on Earth, with a net worth of nearly $400 billion — more than the yearly budgets for entire agencies responsible for services like health, housing, agriculture and education. Shareholders for Tesla have approved a pay package of $56 billion for Musk, with the package currently being held up in court. Additionally, Musk has used his ownership of X to shape public opinion. Since the billionaire purchased the platform, he has carried out widespread censorship , especially of left-wing accounts , while uplifting right-wing and Nazi content — along with anyone who defends him and his companies. “So let me get this straight, he wants contracts for cancer research cancelled but says let keep contracts for his company SpaceX to do research. Greedy billionaire trying to ripoff the American people pretending to be altruistic is all I see,” Omar said in a social media post on Tuesday. Other progressive lawmakers condemned Musk’s claims on Tuesday that he is carrying out the will of voters and that “the people are going to get what they voted for,” pointing out that Musk is an unelected official carrying out an administrative coup and that DOGE was created after Trump was elected. “The people didn’t vote for you to cut off cancer research funding,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington). Omar also shared an article from last month about Europe’s largest pension fund selling its $585 million stake in Tesla. The pension fund cited issues with Musk’s “ exceptionally high ” pay package. “The greedy billionaire that Europe rejects is the same man the Republicans are imposing on the American people,” Omar said. “Mind you, Elon has never suggested using his wealth to help the American people who made him a billionaire with the help of U.S. taxpayer dollars.” Omar and other lawmakers held a press conference on Tuesday further criticizing Republicans for supporting drastic cuts to essential services while keeping military funding intact. “We have seen this Republican playbook before. They claim we must cut spending on education, on health care like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, on housing, on foreign aid, on climate solutions. But when it comes to defense contractors, they open the purse strings, pouring billions of dollars into the pockets of their well-connected friends,” said Sen. Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts). “This bloated Pentagon budget does not make us safer.”
Edward Coristine created URLs that promoted racism against Black people and sexual violence against women and children. A third employee of billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is under fire for his disturbing online footprint, which includes registering URLs featuring racial slurs and references to rape and child sexual abuse. The DOGE task force — which was created through a legally dubious executive order by President Donald Trump — has spent the past weeks ripping through government agencies, furloughing or firing government workers and cutting spending that doesn’t align with Trump’s far right agenda. The group has operated with virtually no oversight, despite its employees being granted access to some of the country’s most sensitive data. On Wednesday, the Elon Musk-based news site Musk Watch reported that a member of the DOGE team, 19-year-old Edward Coristine, created multiple disturbing web URLs , including kkk-is-cool.club, raping-women.club and child-porn.store. Coristine also created URLs that included the n-word and referenced slavery, and URLs promoting the use of date rape drugs. All of these URLs redirected users to a photo sharing website, tesla.sexy (a clear indication of his affinity for Musk), which Coristine said would allow users to post images without their IP addresses or any other identifying features being logged. Coristine was formerly an intern for Musk’s Neuralink company . Currently, he is listed as a senior adviser to the Bureau of Diplomatic Technology at the State Department, and as an “expert” at the Office of Personnel Management, suggesting that his role likely includes determining which government employees should remain in their positions. In addition to creating a litany of abhorrent URLs, Coristine has interacted with at least one prominent white supremacist on the social media site X, responding to a post by Joseph Bronski, a noted backer of the long-debunked racist social theory of eugenics. The contents of Coristine’s now-deleted post — which was in response to a post by Bronski promoting racist narratives regarding the IQ levels of white and Black children — are unknown. The revelation of Coristine’s URLs and other online activity is indicative of a disturbing pattern within DOGE, as at least two other members of the team have posted similar content. Gavin Kliger, who is listed as a “special adviser” to the director of the Office of Personnel Management, recently promoted white nationalist and misogynistic posts on X. According to reporting from Reuters , these posts included vehemently anti-immigrant sentiments, including demands that migrants adhere to “standards of hygiene and social norms” of the countries they immigrate to. Marko Elez, a DOGE member who has access to Treasury Department systems (including those relating to a majority of payments made by the U.S. government), has also posted racist content on social media . In a series of now-deleted X posts, Elez called for the repeal of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, bragged about being racist “before it was cool,” and demanded that hatred of Indian workers within the tech industry be normalized. Elez also expressed disgust at the idea of interracial marriage, suggested that U.S. immigration policy should be based on eugenics, and said that he wouldn’t “mind at all if Gaza and Israel were both wiped off the face of the Earth.” Elez, who was the first of the DOGE workers to come under fire for his online footprint, resigned from his position after the posts came to light. Soon after his resignation, however, Vice President J.D. Vance and Trump came to his defense, and Elez was eventually reinstated. Meanwhile, Musk himself has expressed a number of far right and bigoted views . He has repeatedly endorsed the neo-Nazi political party Alternative for Germany (AfD), and was recently accused of performing a Nazi salute at a Trump rally on inauguration day. He has also expressed opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and has promoted accounts on X that have downplayed or denied the Holocaust.
The Office of Commercial Space Transportation has proposed fines and grounded Elon Musk’s SpaceX for numerous incidents. This story was originally published by ProPublica , a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. When SpaceX’s Starship exploded in January, raining debris over the Caribbean, the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily grounded the rocket program and ordered an investigation. The move was the latest in a series of actions taken by the agency against the world’s leading commercial space company. “Safety drives everything we do at the FAA,” the agency’s chief counsel said in September, after proposing $633,000 in fines for alleged violations related to two previous launches. “Failure of a company to comply with the safety requirements will result in consequences.” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s response was swift and caustic. He accused the agency of engaging in “lawfare” and threatened to sue it for “regulatory overreach.” “The fundamental problem is that humanity will forever be confined to Earth unless there is radical reform at the FAA!” Musk wrote on X . Today, Musk is in a unique position to deliver that change. As one of President Donald Trump’s closest advisers and head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, he’s presiding over the administration’s effort to cut costs and slash regulation. While it’s unclear what changes his panel has in store for the FAA, current and former employees are bracing for Musk to focus on the little-known part of the agency that regulates his rocket company: the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, known as AST. “People are nervous,” said a former employee who did not want to be quoted by name talking about Musk. The tech titan and his company have been critical of the office, which is responsible for licensing commercial rocket launches and ensuring public safety around them. After the fines in September, SpaceX sent a letter to Congress blasting AST for being too slow to keep up with the booming space industry. That same month, Musk called on FAA chief Mike Whitaker to resign and told attendees at a conference in Los Angeles, “It really should not be possible to build a giant rocket faster than paper can move from one desk to another.” FAA leadership seems to have heard him. The day of Trump’s inauguration, Whitaker stepped down — a full four years before the end of his term. And experts said the pressure is almost certain to grow this year as Musk pursues an aggressive launch schedule for Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built. Whitaker did not respond to requests for comment. Part of the problem for AST, experts say, is bandwidth. The office has seen a sixfold increase in launches in the past six years, from 26 in 2019 to 157 last year — with SpaceX leading the pack . At the same time, AST’s staffing and budget have not kept pace. The agency has roughly 160 people to oversee regular flights by private rocket companies — sometimes more than one a day — bringing satellites to orbit, giving rides to astronauts, assisting with national security surveillance efforts and carrying tourists to the edge of space. Launch traffic “has increased exponentially,” said George Nield, who led the office from 2008 to 2018. “No signs that that’s turning around or even leveling off.” For each launch, AST’s staff calculate the risk that “uninvolved” members of the public, or their property, will be harmed. They also consider whether the launch will cause environmental damage or interfere with other airspace activities like commercial flight, as well as make sure a rocket’s payload received the proper approvals. The office licenses space vehicle reentries, too, though, as yet, there are far fewer of them. The process, on average, takes five months. “It takes a certain amount of time to do the work to protect the public, and you do want to do that right,” Nield said. The consequences of shrinking the office or eliminating it altogether could be devastating, he said. “If a rocket goes off course, and nobody’s double-checked it, and so you have a major catastrophic event, that’s going to result in a huge backlash.” But Musk has criticized AST for focusing on “nonsense that doesn’t affect safety.” He’s also emphasized that his company moves quickly and must have failures to learn and improve. Within SpaceX, this approach is known as “rapid iterative development.” And it is not without risk. Last month, when Starship blew up shortly after liftoff, dozens of airplanes scrambled to avoid falling debris. Residents of the Caribbean islands of Turks and Caicos reported finding pieces of the craft on beaches and roads, and the FAA said a car sustained minor damage. SpaceX has said it was reviewing data to determine the cause, pledging to “conduct a thorough investigation, in coordination with the FAA, and implement corrective actions to make improvements on future Starship flight tests.” Musk, however, downplayed the explosion as “ barely a bump in the road. ” Moreover, he seemed to brush off safety concerns, posting a video of the flaming debris field with the caption, “Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!” He also said nothing suggested the accident would push plans to launch the next Starship this month — even though the FAA investigation was still pending. Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas, said that Musk’s response was “recklessness … at a minimum,” given that people were alarmed by the falling rocket debris, which streaked fire and smoke across the sky before landing in and around the islands. “That he now gets to provide government oversight over the things that he is trying to get permission to do is one of the most significant conflicts of interest I’ve seen in my career, and it’s inexplicable to me,” said Jah, who served on a federal advisory committee for AST. The White House did not answer questions from ProPublica about DOGE’s plans for AST. Officials referred to comments by Trump, who said last week that if a conflict arises for Musk between one of his businesses and his government work, “we won’t let him go near it.” Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s press secretary, also said Musk “will excuse himself from those contracts” if needed. Musk and SpaceX did not respond to questions. Jah said Musk and others advocating for less regulation have what he called a “launch, baby, launch mentality” that could push the FAA office in the wrong direction. Industry representatives and members of Congress have accused the FAA of being more risk averse than necessary, stifling innovation. “With nations like China seeking to leapfrog our accomplishments in space, it is even more imperative that we streamline our processes, issue timely approvals, minimize regulatory burdens and advance innovative space concepts,” said Rep. Brian Babin, a Republican from Texas and the incoming chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, at a hearing in September. He said he was concerned the FAA’s regulations could result in the mission to return astronauts to the moon being “unnecessarily delayed.” Babin did not respond to a request for an interview about AST. Sean Duffy, Trump’s new transportation secretary, has already indicated his department will take a more business-friendly approach. Last month during his confirmation hearing, when Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas criticized the FAA’s enforcement action against SpaceX and asked Duffy whether he would “commit to reviewing these penalties and more broadly to curtailing bureaucratic overreach and accelerating launch approvals,” Duffy said he would. “I commit to doing a review and working with you, and following up on the space launches and what’s been happening at the FAA with regard to the launches.” Duffy has since said he’s spoken to Musk about airspace reform and is looking to DOGE to “help upgrade our aviation system” — a move that drew a quick rebuke from Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington last week. She called Musk’s involvement in FAA matters a conflict of interest. The Department of Transportation did not make Duffy available for an interview, and the FAA did not answer written questions provided by ProPublica , despite multiple requests for comment. Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat of the Science committee, said streamlining the regulation of commercial space launches has bipartisan support. Still, she said, the safety of crews and launchpads’ neighbors, as well as noise and pollution, need to be managed. “There needs to be a traffic cop here,” she said, especially given increased launches and issues such as space debris. “This can’t just be the Wild West, right?” The $42 million allocated annually to AST is less than 1% of the FAA’s budget. Astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, who tracks space launches at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, said the office needs the resources and authority to hold companies accountable as the industry grows and has more impact. “Government will need to play a role,” he said, “and they’re going to have to sort it out.” Last year, a government advisory committee recommended the AST move out of the FAA and become a standalone agency within the Department of Transportation. Proponents argue the move would help AST get more attention, and potentially resources. Industry supporters also say the FAA’s culture of allowing no failures — a bedrock of its oversight of the commercial airline industry — is culturally a bad fit for what AST does, given how young the space industry is. AST does not require that each mission succeed in the conventional sense, said Caryn Schenewerk, an industry consultant who sat on the advisory committee. “They can’t,” she said. Launching rockets is still so new, the office’s goal is to make sure failures don’t hurt anyone — not to prevent them altogether, she said. As launches have become more common, though, so too have problems like the Starship explosion. A report from the Government Accountability Office found that in the three years before its 2023 review, commercial space launches experienced roughly two dozen mishaps, the industry’s term for “catastrophic explosions and other failures.” While the report noted that none of those incidents resulted in fatalities, serious injuries or significant property damage to the public, there have been other impacts. Starship’s first launch in April 2023, for example, blew a cloud of dust and grime that stretched miles across Texas. Debris like concrete and shrapnel rained down on an environmentally sensitive migratory bird habitat near the company’s Boca Chica launchpad. Residents have complained, Jah said, but “citizens of that community aren’t feeling that they’re being heard.” A report in The New York Times noted egg yolk staining the ground near a bird’s nest. In response, Musk wrote on X : “To make up for this heinous crime, I will refrain from having omelette for a week.” SpaceX’s plans to launch the next Starship this month are part of the accelerated schedule the company has been pushing AST to approve. The company launched four of the vehicles in 2024, and officials said it wants to launch 25 this year.
Some Trump officials have said they may ignore future court rulings, which could result in a constitutional crisis. A federal judge has admonished the Trump administration for failing to follow to the letter a temporary restraining order on a White House policy to freeze federal funds as the administration, including Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), rips through federal agencies examining their spending priorities. Ostensibly to ensure that spending is in line with President Donald Trump’s far right agenda, the spending freeze had halted a number of important payments , including to Medicaid, to state governments, and to federal grant programs like Head Start and Meals on Wheels, to name a few. U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell issued a ruling last week halting that spending freeze in response to a complaint filed by state Democratic administrations across the country. However, funding freezes for some programs continued, with new freezes popping up as well. The states sued again, asking for McConnell to reiterate his initial ruling. The Department of Justice (DOJ), arguing on behalf of Trump, had stated to the court that the original order wasn’t violated because it was supposedly limited in scope . Freezes on spending for agencies like the National Institutes of Health, spending relating to the climate crisis, health care spending and more could continue, the DOJ claimed. McConnell issued a forceful order on Monday, disagreeing with the Trump administration’s arguments. “The plain language of the TRO entered in this case prohibits all categorical pauses or freezes in obligations or disbursements based on the OMB Directive or based on the President’s 2025 Executive Orders,” McConnell wrote in his ruling . “The Defendants received notice of the TRO, the Order is clear and unambiguous, and there are no impediments to the Defendants’ compliance with the Order.” McConnell also found that the states had “presented evidence” showing that the Trump administration had “continued to improperly freeze federal funds and refused to resume disbursement of appropriated federal funds.” “The broad categorical and sweeping freeze of federal funds is, as the Court found, likely unconstitutional and has caused and continues to cause irreparable harm to a vast portion of this country,” McConnell said, adding that the “pauses in funding violate the plain text of the TRO.” McConnell ordered that all funding freezes stop immediately , and for funding that was missed to be restored. He also suggested that individuals within the Trump White House who continued to violate his ruling could be found in contempt of court. The initial defiance by the Trump administration is alarming, especially given that members of the White House have indicated that Trump may ignore such orders in the future — an action that would upend the federal government’s three-branch system of checks and balances. Musk, responding to an order from a different judge who also placed a restraining order on his work with DOGE, criticized the ruling as “corrupt” and stated that the jurist in question “needs to be impeached.” “Something super shady is going to protect scammers,” Musk said in a separate post about the judge, providing no evidence to justify his claim. Musk also shared a post on Saturday that had been written by a right-wing account on X. In that post, the user wrote that they didn’t “like the precedent it sets when you defy a judicial ruling, but I’m just wondering what other options are these judges leaving us if they’re going to blatantly disregard the constitution for their own partisan political goals?” The billionaire indicated that he agreed with the user’s statement. And in response to McConnell’s latest order on Monday, Musk again derided the judge on X , falsely characterizing his ruling as an “undemocratic and unconstitutional power grab” and calling McConnell an “activist judge.” Vice President J.D. Vance expressed similar views in posts on Sunday, wrongly saying that it is “illegal” for judges to impose limits on executive branch officials . “Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power,” Vance wrote — an errant claim that ignores centuries of precedent regarding judicial review in the United States, including rulings that benefited Vance and Trump when former President Joe Biden was in office. At least 10 federal judges have issued rulings blocking Trump’s executive orders or other actions undertaken by his administration or by individuals within DOGE. If the Trump administration chooses to ignore just one of them, it would set off a constitutional crisis in this country, demonstrating in definite terms Trump’s intent to expand his presidential powers to the line of dictatorship.
White South Africans make up about 7 percent of the population but own more than 70 percent of the farmland. President Trump has ordered a freeze on all foreign aid to South Africa in an executive order he signed Friday, claiming that a new land reform law amounts to “government-sponsored race-based discrimination.” The country’s white minority still owns the vast majority of farmland decades after the end of apartheid rule. Trump also criticized South Africa’s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ and said the United States would accept white South Africans as refugees facing what he characterized as persecution. The cuts to aid are already causing widespread suffering in South Africa, where “after 30 years of democracy, not much has changed in terms of wealth ownership” and a white population with colonial roots is “using politics, ideology, misinformation and propaganda … to maintain the status quo,” says South African activist Trevor Ngwane. This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman. President Trump ordered a freeze on all foreign aid to South Africa in an executive order Friday, claiming South Africa’s white population is facing, quote, “government-sponsored race-based discrimination.” Trump has repeatedly criticized the new land reform law in South Africa, where the country’s white minority still owns the vast majority of farmland 30 years after the end of apartheid rule. Trump wrote on his Truth Social account Sunday, “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,” unquote. Trump has made the claim before. The South African government says it’s part of a, quote, “campaign of misinformation and propaganda,” unquote. His order also claims South African leaders have, quote, “taken aggressive positions” toward the U.S. and its allies, citing its pursuit of genocide claims against Israel before the International Court of Justice. South Africans responded to the freeze of an estimated $440 million in U.S. aid. This is a woman seeking her regular treatment for HIV/AIDS when she realized the clinic was closed. She spoke with Sky News Africa correspondent Yousra Elbagir. YOUSRA ELBAGIR: Are you trying to go to the clinic? PATIENT: Yeah. YOUSRA ELBAGIR: It’s closed. PATIENT: What happened? YOUSRA ELBAGIR: I mean, the USAID funding has been frozen, so they’re closing down clinics. Do you have alternatives? PATIENT: I don’t know. I’m going to ask next door. Hopefully they’ll be able to assist me. If they can’t, I don’t know. I don’t know what to do. Serious. What will I do? There’s nothing. AMY GOODMAN: Trump’s order also offered refugee status in the United States to white South Africans, Afrikaners, who are, quote, “victims of unjust racial discrimination.” But many in the right-wing white lobby groups say they want to stay and focus on ending Black majority rule. All of this comes as the South African-born billionaire, the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, now a leader in Trump’s administration, has said white South Africans have been the victims of, quote, “racist ownership laws,” and accused the post-apartheid government of anti-white racism. Last week, Musk’s 78-year-old father Errol Musk said an adviser to South African President Cyril Ramaphosa asked him to help. ERROL MUSK: I was asked if I can arrange a quick talk between Ramaphosa and Elon, last night. So, I said, “All right.” So I did. And then they spoke a few minutes later. And it’s on my phone. … I can only imagine that Elon would have said, “Look, we want to help you, but you have to quit this — this war on white people in South Africa.” AMY GOODMAN: Errol Musk is Elon Musk’s father. Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, has increasingly embraced far-right leaders and conspiracy theories that some have linked to his roots in apartheid-era South Africa. In a minute, we’ll also look at how Musk is part of the “PayPal mafia” of libertarian billionaires with roots in South Africa under white rule, who now hold powerful positions in the tech industry and politics and surround the White House. But we begin in Johannesburg with Trevor Ngwane, Soweto-based activist and chair of the United Front, umbrella body of community and labor organizations. Welcome back, Trevor, to Democracy Now! Talk about the effects of this immediate cutting off of all U.S. aid to South Africa, your country. TREVOR NGWANE: Thank you, Amy. Yeah, it’s terrible, because remember that there’s a lot of programs here which rely on American funding, primarily the HIV program, PEPFAR. Seventeen percent of the programs are funded by money from America. And with one stroke, all those services were stopped, because no money came through. And millions of people are suffering, including other community, social and health programs. So this is very bad for the people here in South Africa. AMY GOODMAN: I mean, it’s very interesting you mentioned PEPFAR. Let’s remember that it was established by the former Republican President of the United States George W. Bush, what many call perhaps the most important achievement of his presidency. The significance, when you talk, Trevor, looking back at the end of apartheid in ’94, white South Africans, who make up, what, 7% of the population, owning farms that make up about half of South Africa? What are your thoughts on the information or misinformation we’re getting in the United States about land seizures from Donald Trump and from the South African-born Elon Musk? TREVOR NGWANE: Well, white people, you know, are sitting pretty. They manage to hang onto most of their wealth. Due to global and local economic processes, the rich continue to get richer, and the poor get poorer. Most of the white — of the farmland, more than 70% of it is owned by white farmers. So, basically, they are sitting pretty. You know, they’ve got nothing to complain about. Perhaps, Amy — you know, there’s a saying, “The guilty are afraid.” Perhaps they know that this unjust situation, where a tiny minority enjoys most of the country’s wealth and resources, is not tenable, and sooner or later, it will have to end. AMY GOODMAN: And finally, Trevor, President Trump welcoming Afrikaner refugees into the United States as flight after flight takes immigrants from the United States, for example, to Guantánamo? TREVOR NGWANE: Yeah, well, the white people here are not interested in going to the U.S.A. because they’re having a good life here. The only thing that is bothering them is what I can call white fears in the face of Black aspirations, indeed Black frustrations, because after 30 years of democracy, not much has changed in terms of, you know, where’s ownership, in terms of basic improvement in the everyday lives of the people. White people, they are human beings. They can see that the suffering continues. They’re just guilty. And they know that they should part give away some of their wealth, but they are not prepared, so they are using politics, ideology, misinformation and propaganda, some of them, you know, to maintain the status quo. AMY GOODMAN: Trevor Ngwane is joining us from Johannesburg, South Africa.
In one of Marko Elez’s many disturbing online posts over the past year, he proudly referred to himself as a racist. A 25-year-old staffer for Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) who resigned from his position last week after his racist social media posts came to light has been reinstated following defenses from Musk, Vice President J.D. Vance and President Donald Trump. Marko Elez’s role at DOGE gave him access to the Treasury Department’s systems , including those responsible for the majority of payments made by the U.S. government. Prior to taking on his role at DOGE, Elez worked at companies owned by Musk. Last week, a Wall Street Journal report highlighted many of Elez’s alarming posts on X, including posts where he called for the repeal of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, bragged about being racist “before it was cool,” and demanded that the tech sector “normalize Indian hate.” “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity,” Elez said in one of his posts. “I would not mind at all if Gaza and Israel were both wiped off the face of the Earth,” he said in another. Elez also said that the U.S. should implement an immigration policy based on eugenics, a white nationalist social theory that has long been debunked as unscientific and racist . Most of Elez’s posts were published within the past year. In response to the account coming to light, several Trump administration officials came to Elez’s defense, saying the posts weren’t worth firing someone over. Vance, for example, downplayed Elez’s racism , referring to the posts as “stupid social media activity” that shouldn’t ruin his life. He also described Elez as a “kid,” and attacked The Wall Street Journal for supposedly trying to “destroy people.” “If he’s a bad dude or a terrible member of the team, fire him for that,” Vance said , adding that Musk should “bring him back.” His comments failed to address widespread concerns from the public regarding someone with racist views having access to “top-secret” level government data . In response to Vance’s post, Musk said on Friday that Elez “will be brought back” to the DOGE team. “To err is human, to forgive divine,” Musk added. In addition to defending his employee’s racist comments, Musk has attacked Katherine Long , the Wall Street Journal reporter who unearthed them. The billionaire issued several posts on X calling for her to be “fired immediately,” and wrongly characterized her reporting as doxxing . “She’s a disgusting and cruel person,” Musk said in one of his posts . Musk’s attacks on Long echo comments Trump has made against the press , which have included personal insults and threats against those who publish reports that are critical of him. Notably, Musk himself has faced widespread backlash for peddling racist and antisemitic views. He was recently accused of performing a Nazi salute twice, and has endorsed the neo-Nazi political party Alternative for Germany (AfD) in that country’s upcoming elections. After his purchase of Twitter, now called X, the site saw a spike in neo-Nazi and white supremacist posts, with Musk himself promoting racist content on the platform. Asked by reporters late last week about bringing Elez back to the fold, Trump said he was supportive of the move, referencing Vance’s post on X. “I’m with the vice president,” Trump said on Friday . Antiracist historian Ibram X. Kendi responded to Vance’s characterization of Elez as a “kid” by noting that it was an incredible example of white privilege. “For White men: Boys will be boys. Don’t ruin his life,” Kendi wrote on Facebook . “For Black boys: Zero tolerance for misbehavior. Try him as an adult.” “To be racist is to treat White adults like kids and Black kids like adults. To be antiracist is to treat all adults like adults and all kids like kids,” Kendi added.
Critics say the move appears designed to remove obstructions to Elon Musk’s plan for a new payment app. The Trump administration’s multi-pronged attack on the CFPB continues. President Donald Trump’s new acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Russell Vought, told the agency to cease nearly all its operations in a series of orders on Saturday night and the move is not just a gift to the broader financial industry and large Wall Street banks, say critical observers, but also a major potential gift to billionaire Elon Musk , the world’s wealthiest person, who has a major vested interest in the agency’s demise. Vought, the right-wing architect of the anti-government Project 2025 who also now heads the powerful Office of Management and Budget, confirmed Saturday night he had taken control of the agency in an email to staff that called on them to halt most of their work. According to reporting by NBC News , which obtained a copy of the email, Employees were instructed to “cease all supervision and examination activity,” “cease all stakeholder engagement,” pause all pending investigations, not issue any public communications and pause “enforcement actions.” Vought also told employees not to “approve or issue any proposed or final rules or formal or informal guidance” and to “suspend the effective dates of all final rules that have been issued or published but that have not yet become effective,” among other directives listed in the email. He said in the email that the directives are effective immediately, unless he approves an exception or a certain activity is required by law. The agency has been a target for Republicans for years and the party has contested in court its source of funding, which unlike most other agencies is funded by the Federal Reserve as opposed to regular appropriations by Congress. That mechanism, however, was established by Congress when the CFPB was created — an approach that was designed to shield it from political interference — and has withstood all legal challenges, including one before the U.S. Supreme Court last year. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), credited with bringing the CFPB to life, said the orders from Vought make clear the Trump administrations intentions. “Vought is giving big banks and giant corporations the green light to scam families,” Warren said Saturday. “The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has returned over $21 billion to families cheated by Wall Street. Republicans have failed to gut it in Congress and in the courts. They will fail again.” Vought, in his online post, said he also informed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Saturday that the agency would be requesting $0 for the upcoming draw period, claiming that no additional funds were needed to fulfill its work. “The Bureau’s current balance of $711.6 million is in fact excessive in the current fiscal environment,” Vought claimed. “This spigot, long contributing to CFPB’s unaccountability, is now being turned off.” Critics point out that Musk, who has been appointed by Trump to head the Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE ), has serious conflicts when it comes to the Trump administration’s targeting of the CFPB. DOGE is not a real department but has claimed sweeping authority to access the sensitive workings of federal agencies — triggering an avalanche of legal challenges as a result. In addition to Vought’s statements, the previous CFPB acting director, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, last week issued an internal stop work order that was challenged by Democratic lawmakers. On Friday, as Common Dreams reported , Musk himself posted “CFPB RIP” on social media next to a picture of a gravestone and his detractors have argued his antagonism is not based solely on his ideological opposition to an agency that has returned over $20 billion to consumers over recent years from bad financial actors. In an appearance Saturday on MSNBC , Lindsay Owens, executive director of the progressive advocacy group Groundwork Collective, explained that while Vought’s targeting of CFPB can be explained by well-documented fealty to various corporate interests — and a desire “to destroy the government from the inside out” — Musk’s motivations are likely “more sinister” and closer to home. Elon Musk and Russ Vought have taken over the CFPB. That’s bad news for consumers. Vought’s aim is to destroy govt from the inside out, and Musk's motive is more sinister. As he partners with Visa on a payment app, he has an interest in ensuring the CFPB doesn't get in his way. pic.twitter.com/C7FAFfG0xI Diminishing CFPB’s ability to operate as well as getting a look at its trove of files, including the inner workings of those institutions it has been tasked with holding to account, said Owens, is a for Musk to “grease the skids for his new business interest.” “We know that Elon Musk is interested in starting his own payment app — he’s partnered with Visa to do that,” she explained, “and so he has a real interest in ensuring that the CFPB isn’t blocking an effort like that.” Owens said that Musk’s interest in the agency goes beyond that as well, because the CFPB has “trade secrets from enforcement actions against some of his likely future competitors.” Reporters are missing a huge part of the @CFPB story: Musk now has access to confidential information about his competitors— confidential records and documents obtained through supervision and enforcement. CFPB is a law enforcement agency. Reports say it has been compromised. On Friday, The American Prospect’ s David Dayen reported on the little-noticed Feb. 3 order that Bessent sent out to CFPB staffers which specifically halted new designation of non-bank entities, including “nondepository institutions,” by the agency — a policy that could directly impact Musk’s peer-to-peer payment venture he hopes to launch on X in partnership with Visa. According to Dayen: By stalling designation of nondepository institutions, Bessent ensures that X will not be designated for CFPB supervision, at least in the near term. The more innocent explanation for the last-minute change is that Bessent was likely uninformed about what the CFPB does, and hastily added supervision later. But the inserted directive specifically bars designation of non-banks in the supervisory process, as a not-so-thinly-veiled shield for Big Tech payment app firms, and in particular the company run by special government employee Elon Musk. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) expressed concerns along these grounds on Saturday night. “Elon wants the CFPB gone so tech billionaires can profit from apps, like X, that offer bank-like services but don’t follow financial laws that keep people’s money safe,” charged Markey. “Musk wants to use the government to put more in his pockets. This is a blatant conflict of interest.”
The judge also ordered DOGE members to “immediately destroy” any copies of material downloaded from Treasury systems. A federal judge early Saturday morning blocked Elon Musk’s highly controversial Department of Government Efficiency , or DOGE , from further access to a sensitive and closely guarded Treasury Department payment system, warning of “irreparable harm” presented by the threat to the personal and financial data of millions of Americans. In an emergency order that followed from a lawsuit filed by 19 state attorneys general on Friday, U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said the Treasury Department, in addition to suspending Musk and his team from access, must “immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded from the Treasury Department’s records and systems, if any.” In the coalition’s lawsuit, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, the states argued that allowing DOGE personnel — who have been characterized as far-right libertarian “ goons ” and a “ demolition crew ” intent on gutting federal agencies from the inside out — access to the Treasury system was unlawful in the first place and could give them the ability “to block federal funds to states and programs providing health care, childcare, and other critical services” — none of which they are authorized to do. Here is Judge Paul Engelmayer’s remarkable TRO barring (in effect) DOGE from accessing Treasury’s payment system & ordering (in effect) any DOGE person who has had access to destroy anything already copied. A short thread … /1 pic.twitter.com/ffC7CnQAJO Judge Engelmayer, in his decision, said the named defendants in the suit — President Donald Trump , his Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and the Treasury Department — will be compelled to show cause at a hearing on February 14 before a separate judge presiding over an existing challenge to DOGE’s access to the system. In a statement following the ruling, James said : “This morning, we won a court order blocking Elon Musk , the world’s richest man, from accessing Americans’ private data. Musk and his DOGE employees must destroy all records they’ve obtained. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: no one is above the law.” Under the order, as The Washington Post reports , “the Trump administration is prohibited from giving access to political appointees, special government employees or government employees that are not assigned to the Treasury Department.” On Friday, Wired reported that an internal agency at Treasury had assessed the DOGE personnel placed inside the department as “an insider threat.” “There is ongoing litigation, congressional legislation, and widespread protests relating to DOGE’s access to Treasury and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service,” reads a section of an email from the internal agency reviewed by the news outlet. “If DOGE members have any access to payment systems,” the email continued, “we recommend suspending that access immediately and conducting a comprehensive review of all actions they may have taken on these systems.”
Right-wing climate denialists accuse the National Weather Service of promoting alarmism over the climate crisis. Under orders from President Donald Trump, unelected tech billionaire Elon Musk and his rogue unit, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have taken a political sledgehammer to federal agencies as part of a top-down personnel and cost-cutting shakeup that has been derided by Democrats and legal experts as unconstitutional. Employees across the federal government have faced intimidation and threats of layoffs as part of Trump and Musk’s effort to cut spending without congressional approval and replace career civil servants with loyalists. Trump and DOGE face legal challenges , but observers fear the damage will be done by the time courts step in, including to critical research and services the public relies on to stay safe as the climate crisis intensifies. When DOGE barged into the offices of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric A (NOAA) this week, the scrutiny from Musk’s unelected and unaccountable team added to fears that the collection of agencies the nation relies on to manage fisheries, track climate change , forecast hurricanes and issue severe weather warnings will be gutted and privatized under Trump. Musk reportedly staffed DOGE with young, inexperienced engineers from Silicon Valley. “They apparently just sort of walked past security and said: ‘Get out of my way,’ and they’re looking for access for the IT systems, as they have in other agencies,” said Andrew Rosenberg, a former NOAA fisheries official who was quoted in The Guardian on Tuesday. More than over 100 civil society groups are demanding that Congress investigate DOGE, but leaders of the Republican majority have downplayed or defended Musk’s efforts. On Wednesday, Democratic Representatives Jared Huffman and Zoe Lofgren of California said “DOGE hackers” have unlawfully gained access to private personal information and are gutting critical programs at federal agencies. “Now they have reached NOAA where they’re wreaking havoc on the scientific and regulatory systems that protect American families’ safety and jobs,” Huffman and Lofgren said in a statement. NOAA includes the National Hurricane Center and National Weather Service (NWS), which provide forecasts and data to researchers and the public as well as private companies that are eager to control weather data and sell it for a profit. As a global leader in climate science, NOAA is also under pressure from far right climate deniers who accuse the agency of promoting a political agenda by making its constantly updated data on climate change available for free. With labs that measure global temperatures, melting Arctic ice, and levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, NOAA provides indisputable evidence that the climate crisis is real, which flies in the face of Trump’s pro-fossil fuel agenda. Timothy Whitehouse, director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), which protects civil servants, especially whistleblowers working on environmental issues, said NOAA’s labs are at risk of being defunded and transformed into a commercial venture that sells data to private industry, rather than a public service meant to warn everyone about heat waves and intensifying storms. “What I call the Musk-Trump confederacy to destroy government functions and privatize what’s left of the valuable parts of these agencies is absolutely frightening, and we cannot allow these very large powerful corporations to control public data and to monetize it for their own benefit,” Whitehouse said in an interview. Sources within the agency told Axios on Wednesday that a member of DOGE combed through NOAA databases searching for information on resource groups for LGBT employees and women as part of Trump’s crackdown on diversity initiatives. While DOGE initially appeared to focus on personnel rather than the agency’s climate data, Whitehouse spoke to career officials who said internal anxiety about the future of NOAA and its scientific mission remains high. “What I call the Musk-Trump confederacy to destroy government functions and privatize what’s left of the valuable parts of these agencies is absolutely frightening.” Looming over DOGE’s scrutiny of NOAA is Project 2025, the policy blueprint for the Trump regime prepared by the Heritage Foundation and other far right groups. Project 2025 calls NOAA a “main driver of the climate change alarm industry” and therefore a “harmful to future U.S. prosperity,” a claim clearly rooted in anti-science denialism. “This industry’s mission emphasis on prediction and management seems designed around the fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable,” it goes on to say. “That is not to say NOAA is useless, but its current organization corrupts its useful functions.” The blueprint calls for NOAA and its six main offices to be broken up and downsized, and for the forecasts of the NWS to be “fully commercialized” in order to serve private interests. Trump disavowed Project 2025 on the campaign trail, but his administration’s attacks on federal agencies closely mirror the playbook. Russell Vought, Trump’s newly confirmed pick to run the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), is one of Project 2025’s authors. Along with Rosenberg, the former NOAA official, Whitehouse said private companies have long wanted to prevent NOAA from releasing data to the public so they can package it up and sell it as part of online weather forecasting products, for example. Meanwhile, meteorologists serving local communities face layoffs as the TV broadcasting industry consolidates, potentially leaving people in underserved areas with fewer options for accessing information on severe weather and other risks, all as the fallout from climate crisis rapidly accelerates. “Much of the world including private services rely on NOAA data, and if that’s privatized, you will have Musk-type control over data that the entire world depends upon,” Whitehouse said in an interview. “Do you really want oligarch billionaires controlling data that will determine how governments, communities and businesses respond to emerging threats that determine long-term trends in the health of our planet?” Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee to head the U.S. Department of Commerce, under which NOAA falls, said he opposes the Project 2025 proposal to dismantle NOAA during a confirmation hearing last week. Trump’s nominee to run NOAA, Neil Jacobs, served as acting administrator during Trump’s first term and is best known for defending Trump during the embarrassing “Sharpiegate” scandal in 2019, when the president insisted on highlighting a bizarre and grossly incorrect forecast of Hurricane Dorian’s path toward the U.S. coastline altered with a black marker. Jacobs is also a fellow at the American Meteorological Society and a respected researcher in his field. Whitehouse said the real question is whether Jacobs will be allowed to act independently from Trump and Musk. “To the extent that he can assert political power within the agency and within the Trump administration remains to be seen, and it remains to be seen what his beliefs are on the issue of privatizing the weather service,” Whitehouse said. Whitehouse said OMB and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) are effectively running NOAA and other federal agencies at this point, leaving career employees and even Trump’s political appointees virtually powerless during Musk’s purge. “Normally there’s a transition period with transition teams working with political appointees and articulating priorities for federal agencies, but that’s not what happening here,” Whitehouse said. “OPM and OMB are blowing up these agencies intentionally.”
The racist posts from DOGE member Marko Elez included a call to end the 1964 Civil Rights Act. UPDATE : Following reports that DOGE member Marko Elez resigned from his position (after racist posts from him on social media were unearthed), Vice President J.D. Vance called for him to be reinstated , downplaying the bigoted missives from Elez and saying that “stupid social media activity shouldn’t ruin a kid’s life.” Elez, who is 25-years-old and made the posts in question just this past summer and fall, also received support from President Donald Trump to return to his DOGE position: “I’m with the vice president,” Trump said to reporters on Friday when asked about Vance’s comments .

The original article appears below: The original article appears below: A member of billionaire Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has resigned after reports exposed that he was behind a deleted social media account that advocated for racism and eugenics. Engineer Marko Elez, one of the infamous young members of DOGE, has worked for Musk’s companies in other staff roles before . According to reporting from Wired, Elez’s role at DOGE granted him direct access to the Treasury Department’s systems , including those with “top-secret” clearance distinctions and those responsible for “nearly all payments made by the U.S. government.” On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported on several now-deleted posts from X account @nullllptr, which reportedly belonged to Elez. Those posts included calls to repeal the 1964 Civil Rights Act , a demand for the U.S. to adopt a “eugenic immigration policy,” and a call to “normalize Indian hate” within the tech sector, among other bigoted musings. “You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity,” Elez said in a post from September. “I would not mind at all if Gaza and Israel were both wiped off the face of the Earth,” he said in a post from July. “Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” Elez also wrote that month. When asked about the texts, the White House said that Elez immediately offered his resignation from DOGE. Musk’s DOGE project, a “department” with dubious legal status that was only formed through an executive order from President Donald Trump, has been ripping through several government departments and agencies , halting spending for key programs, pressuring government workers to take purported “buyout” plans to resign from their positions, and taking other actions without any kind of oversight or transparency. Notably, Musk himself has consistently expressed extreme far right views. He was recently accused of publicly performing a Nazi salute , and endorsed Alternative for Germany (AfD) in that country’s upcoming elections, a neo-Nazi political party whose leaders have repeatedly peddled anti-immigrant and antisemitic rhetoric and downplayed or outright denied the Holocaust. Musk vehemently opposes any government or private sector program that promotes diversity, equity and inclusion , and has espoused many transphobic views on social media. After Musk purchased Twitter, which he renamed X, the site saw a massive spike in neo-Nazi and white nationalist content , with the billionaire himself making racist posts on the platform. Earlier this week, Democrats in Congress made several attempts to probe Musk’s brazen takeover of government agencies, demanding that he testify about his work before a congressional committee, for example. “Who is this unelected billionaire that he can attempt to dismantle federal agencies, fire people, transfer them, offer them early retirement and have sweeping changes to federal agencies without having any congressional review?” Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Virginia) asked during a House Oversight Committee hearing on Wednesday . In that hearing, he called for Musk to be subpoenaed by the panel — an effort that ultimately failed due to every Republican on the committee voting against it.
DOGE’s sweep of the federal government has “already been catastrophic,” the suit says. AFL-CIO and other major unions are suing Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in hopes of preventing the rogue agency from “raiding” the Department of Labor and gaining access to the personal information of potentially millions of American workers. In the lawsuit filed Wednesday, the coalition of federal employee unions say that DOGE has been going after federal agencies and seizing their data in moves that experts have said are illegal and raise major questions about the integrity of Americans’ data and Musk’s apparent power to gut the government with little to no oversight despite his seeming status as a private citizen without clearance. The group seeks court intervention to stop DOGE from targeting the Department of Labor in its sweep against federal agencies, through a restraining order or administrative stay. DOGE has already demanded that department employees give them access to “anything they want — or risk termination,” the lawsuit says. A restraining order has been granted to temporarily block the Labor Department from handing information over to DOGE while the court rules on the lawsuit, The Washington Post ’s Lauren Kaori Gurley reported on Thursday. “At every step, DOGE is violating multiple laws,” the lawsuit says. “DOGE seeks to gain access to sensitive systems before courts can stop them, dismantle agencies before Congress can assert its prerogatives in the federal budget, and intimidate and threaten employees who stand in their way, worrying about the consequences later. The results have already been catastrophic.” The lawsuit was filed by Democracy Forward on behalf of AFL-CIO and affiliated unions, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), and Communications Workers of America (CWA). The Economic Policy Institute also joined the suit. “Today, they will come for the Department of Labor. On information and belief, the pattern will be the same: they will demand that DOGE staff be granted access to systems that they are legally barred from; they will fire any employee who protects the integrity of those systems; and they will claim power and authority that Congress has never granted them with respect to agency staff and Department programs,” the suit says. “Elon Musk has absolutely no business raiding the Department of Labor to obtain the sensitive personal information of workers,” AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement . “It’s outrageous that Musk thinks he has the authority to access private data on workers from an agency that’s entrusted with protecting the fundamental rights of working people. With this lawsuit, we intend to stop Musk’s power grab cold.” On the same day the lawsuit was filed, AFL-CIO and affiliates held a rally outside of the Department of Labor to protest Musk’s government pillaging campaign. Thousands attended, according to Zeteo . Lawmakers like Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) attended the rally , condemning the rogue billionaire’s reported plans to raid the department. “We don’t get the benefits and the support and the protections but for the fact that workers organized, and they pushed back, and they fought. And when we don’t get it, we shut it down,” said Tlaib to the crowd. DOGE has spent the last weeks sweeping through the federal government, taking a machete to seemingly indiscriminately eviscerate agencies. Its seizure of the Treasury Department’s payment system , including data on Americans’ social security numbers and financial information, has particularly raised concerns about data privacy in the hands of Musk’s group of young tech workers acting as DOGE operatives. Some have noted that Musk’s sweep, while widespread, appears to be prioritizing agencies that are investigating Musk’s companies for violations. The lawsuit raises concerns, for instance, that DOGE could access sensitive information within the Department of Labor, including workers’ data as well as information on investigations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) into SpaceX, Tesla and The Boring Company. Previous investigations have found that Tesla’s injury rate is far higher than that of the rest of the automobile factory industry, for instance. The Lever has also reported that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which Musk and his operatives have been trying to shut down entirely , had been investigating Musk’s Starlink as of 2022. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that the administration is allowing Musk to determine and “excuse himself” if certain issues are a conflict of interest for him. Labor advocates have also long warned that the Trump administration would go after the Department of Labor as a way to attack the resurging labor movement in the U.S. One of Donald Trump’s first moves in office was the dismissal of Jennifer Abruzzo, the general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board who has been key in advancing labor rights in recent years, as well as labor board member Gwynne Wilcox, despite Trump not having the statutory power to dismiss labor board members for political reasons.
We are witnessing an “extremist, authoritarian power grab to dismantle public education,” says educator Jesse Hagopian. As the Trump administration, led in part by his unelected adviser Elon Musk, sets its sights on cutting the Department of Education, we speak to longtime educator Jesse Hagopian about what he calls an “extremist, authoritarian power grab to dismantle public education and enforce ideological conformity.” Hagopian, whose new book, Teach Truth: The Struggle for Antiracist Education , traces the history of racist educational censorship, adds, “This isn’t about protecting children. We know that dismantling the Department of Education is really about imposing … the violence of organized forgetting.” Please check back later for full transcript.
Their efforts, likely doomed from the start due to GOP congressional control, come as voters demand more resistance. On Wednesday, Democratic lawmakers attempted to block recent actions by President Donald Trump, taking particular aim at his move to allow billionaire campaign benefactor Elon Musk to rip through federal departments and agencies, with full access to several payment systems and the personal data of millions of Americans. Critics have described the billionaire’s actions as akin to a “coup,” as Musk is now seemingly in charge of all agencies, deciding which should continue to run, which employees should be fired or offered questionable buyouts, freezing up payments that should be going to programs across the U.S. and internationally, and more — all of which is likely illegal , observers and some in the administration have noted . Musk is leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a federal role that only exists through a decree Trump made last month. During a House Oversight Committee hearing on Wednesday, ranking member Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Virginia) described Musk’s position as “puzzling,” and called for him to be subpoenaed by the panel in order to answer questions about his work . “Who is this unelected billionaire that he can attempt to dismantle federal agencies, fire people, transfer them, offer them early retirement and have sweeping changes to federal agencies without having any congressional review?” Connolly said during the hearing. The measure was blocked in a party-line vote, with all 20 Republicans voting “no” and all 19 Democratic members of the committee voting “yes.” Also on Wednesday, Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wisconsin) introduced a bill that seeks to limit who can become a “special government employee” within the federal government, a title that the Trump White House has granted to Musk . Under Pocan’s proposal, no person with that designation would be allowed to have contracts with the federal government — meaning that Musk, who has billions of dollars in government contracts through his various companies, would either have to end those agreements or step down from his role as head of DOGE. The bill would strengthen already existing rules for special government employees regarding conflicts of interest — rules that Musk currently appears to be flouting. “No one should have the ability to direct funds towards their personal interest if they are working for the federal government. That’s why we don’t allow Members of Congress or many other federal employees to receive federal contracts,” Pocan said in a statement announcing the bill . “The same is even more true with a special government employee with wide authority to direct federal expenses.” Pocan added : No government employee, ‘Special’ or not, should have any financial interest in who the government does business with. Elon Musk is the poster child for this type of potential abuse. After more than $20 billion in federal contracts, there’s no way Musk can be objective in what he’s doing. With the House of Representatives currently controlled by Republicans, however, Pocan’s measure faces steep odds of consideration or advancement. In the other congressional chamber, Senate Democrats on Wednesday led an all-night marathon of speeches , speaking out against the confirmation of Russell Vought, Trump’s former head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to lead that agency once more. Vought is an ardent Trump loyalist who authored a portion of Project 2025, and became the right-wing policy roadmap’s main promoter after Trump tried to distance himself from the document during his presidential campaign. “Of all the harmful nominees, of all the extremists that Donald Trump has elevated, of all the hard-right ideologues who have come before the Senate, none of them hold a candle to Russell Vought. He is far and away the most dangerous to the American people,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-New York) said in his remarks . Senate Democrats continued their speeches throughThursday morning, likely delaying a vote for Vought until later that day . With 53 Republicans in the Senate, Vought will be confirmed unless four GOP lawmakers side with every Democratic senator against him. The moves from Democratic lawmakers come as polling shows that Democratic voters (and independents who tend to support Democrats) are currently unsatisfied with the lack of action from the party. According to an Economist /YouGov poll published this week , only a fifth of those voters (20 percent) believes that Democratic lawmakers are taking appropriate action to oppose Trump’s agenda so far, while more than three times that number (61 percent) thinks that Democrats aren’t doing enough. Several thousand demonstrators took part in protests against the Trump administration in cities across the U.S. on Wednesday, voicing their disdain for the president’s attacks on transgender rights and his dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs within the federal government. Protesters also condemned Trump for allowing Musk to have access to government data while furloughing workers associated with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In Washington, D.C., protesters held up signs reading “USAID Saves Lives,” and chanted “Elon Musk Has to Go,” among other slogans, NPR reported . Demonstrators in other parts of the country have signaled their support for immigrants in the U.S. as Trump has embarked on an anti-immigrant crackdown across the country. “My family and my friends that have immigrated here belong here,” said Rita Teniente , a nurse who attended a protest in Madison, Wisconsin, noting that her own parents were immigrants. “We feel that we belong here, that we are part of American cloth and that we deserve the same rights.” Dennis Garcia, a protester in Houston, Texas, said he was outraged by the administration’s decision to enact ICE raids in “sensitive locations” — places like schools, churches and hospitals — to detain and ultimately deport people in massive numbers. “Todos los Latinos. We shouldn’t divide each other. We should stick together,” Garcia said . “That’s what this protest is about. That we’re all here, and we’re not going to let them bully us anymore.” Catie Miglietti, a demonstrator in Lansing, Michigan, said she decided to protest in order to show her vehement disagreement with Musk having access to data from the Treasury Department and other agencies. “If we don’t stop it and get Congress to do something, it’s an attack on democracy,” Miglietti said .
While Democrats don’t have the Senate votes to tank Trump nominees, they can derail the chamber’s day-to-day functions. Democrats took turns speaking on the floor of the U.S. Senate into the early hours of Thursday morning in a show of opposition to President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the White House budget office and the new administration’s lawless broadside against key federal agencies — an assault led by unelected billionaire Elon Musk. Facing growing pressure to use every tool available to obstruct an administration that they have characterized as authoritarian, Democratic senators are expected to take up all 30 hours of debate on Russell Vought, a right-wing extremist and Project 2025 architect who is poised to take charge of the Office of Management and Budget. Unless Democrats give in and grant unanimous consent (UC) to end debate — as they’ve done with other Trump nominees in recent days — a vote on Vought’s confirmation won’t take place until Thursday evening. As of this writing, the Democratic speeches are still going . “Americans voted each of us into office to fight for them,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said after speaking on the Senate floor for an hour late Wednesday. “They do not expect us to roll over and play dead.” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) used his floor speech to spotlight what he described as Vought’s plan to “gut programs for working families” and “give massive tax giveaways to billionaires.” Watch @SenJeffMerkley lay out Project 2025 Architect and OMB Director nominee Russell Vought’s three-step plan to: Gut programs for working families Borrow trillions and run up debt Give massive tax giveaways to billionaires pic.twitter.com/2oasfZJvfv For experts and activists who have been urging the minority party to put up a fight in the face of Trump and Musk’s destructive rampage through the federal government, the marathon protest against Vought’s nomination was a positive sign — but not at all sufficient. “This is a start but, to be clear, still nowhere close to maximum obstruction,” Andy Craig, an election policy fellow at the Rainey Center, wrote on social media. “No UC, on anything. No unrecorded votes, on anything. No waiving rules, on anything. Fight even on adjournments. Quorum calls every time you can. Make every dilatory motion in the books and new ones you just made up.” “If you’re not miserable every day with long hours and tedious constant votes, you’re not making them miserable, either,” Craig added. “Make them miserable.” While Democrats don’t have the votes in the Senate to tank Trump nominees, they can severely derail the chamber’s day-to-day functions in many ways. The progressive advocacy group Indivisible lists a number of them : “The easy way to think about this is when you’re going and talking to your Democratic senator, you say ‘Hey, imagine you are Mitch McConnell in the minority, and then do what that asshole would do,'” Indivisible co-executive director Ezra Levin said at a rally earlier this week. But Craig argued late Wednesday that Democrats “should be blowing past McConnell-level obstruction in a way that makes it look like business as usual,” including by breaking Senate rules . “Mitch didn’t do even 1% of what could be done by a minority determined to keep the Senate grinding in circles getting absolutely nothing done,” Craig wrote.
Critics have said Musk’s DOGE efforts are unconstitutional, with some comparing them to a government coup. Earlier this week, it was revealed that President Donald Trump has given multibillionaire Elon Musk, head of the quasi-official Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a “special government employee” designation. That designation means that Musk — the world’s richest person and an ardent Trump supporter who paid hundreds of millions of dollars of his own wealth to ensure that Trump would win the 2024 presidential race — will not be considered a full-time employee, but is also not viewed as a volunteer for the government. A special government employee works 130 days or less during a 365-day calendar. Musk’s work with DOGE has allowed him unprecedented (and unchecked) access and powers in the federal government. Since Trump took office, Musk has used that role to disrupt the work and expenditures of programs within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). He has also been granted access to Treasury Department systems that account for nearly all payments made by the federal government, including Social Security. Musk has these powers despite receiving no congressional approval. The only authorization he has been given is an executive order declaration , which cannot create a whole federal department without oversight. Special government employees are held to strict standards, which Musk appears to be flouting. According to a Justice Department document , such employees are restricted “from participating in a matter” that directly involve their own “financial interests” as well as the interests of any immediate family members, organizations or companies they are tied to. Given that two of Musk’s companies have received over $15.4 billion in government contracts over the past 10 years — and that his companies are frequently the subject of oversight and investigations from federal departments and agencies — it’s clear that that standard isn’t being followed. In response to Musk’s actions being met with widespread criticism, Trump sought to assure reporters on Monday that the billionaire’s work was all under his purview, and that Musk wasn’t taking any action without the president’s authority. “He’s got access only to letting people go that he thinks are no good, if we agree with him. And it’s only if we agree with him,” Trump said . But this conflicts with reports from other Trump administration officials. Citing discussions with a White House official who had knowledge of Musk’s work, The New York Times has reported that “Musk was widely seen as operating with a level of autonomy that almost no one can control.” Beyond Musk himself, little is known of the inexperienced set of individuals working beside him within DOGE, who have the same access to Treasury Department systems and other government agencies’ files that Musk now has. Among the seven workers (who are reportedly between the ages of 19 and 25 ) is an engineer named Marko Elez , who has worked for Musk-owned companies before. It’s unclear whether Elez, or any other DOGE worker, also has special government employee status, but if they do, they, too, would be running afoul of conflict of interest standards. Lawmakers in Congress could feasibly stop this situation altogether by asserting legislative branch powers and making calls for checks and balances. But with both chambers controlled by Trump-aligned Republicans, some lawmakers appear to have acquiesced to Musk and Trump. “What Musk is doing “runs afoul of the Constitution in the strictest sense,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-North Carolina) recently admitted . “ it’s not uncommon for presidents to flex a little bit on where they can spend and where they can stop spending.” Democrats in Congress, meanwhile, have described Musk’s work as likely illegal. At a press conference at the Capitol on Monday, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington), vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee agreed, stating : An unelected, unaccountable billionaire with expansive conflicts of interest, deep ties to China and an indiscreet ax to grind against perceived enemies is hijacking our nation’s most sensitive financial data systems and its checkbook so that he can illegally block funds to our constituents based on the slightest whim or wildest conspiracy. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) lambasted Musk for his power grab. “I just want to be clear about what’s going on here. The system that makes sure that your granddad gets his Social Security check; the system that makes sure that your mom’s doctor gets Medicare payment to cover her medical appointment; and the system that makes sure that you get the tax refund that you’re owed; has been taken over by Elon Musk,” Warren said on Monday , adding that Musk “and his handful of friends now have full access to your personal and financial information that’s in the system.” “Elon just grabbed the controls of our whole payment system, demanding the power to turn it on for his friends or turn it off for anyone he doesn’t like,” Warren went on. In an interview with Democracy Now! Host Amy Goodman earlier this week, Democratic Party strategist Waleed Shahid described the situation in similarly harrowing terms. “If this story was taking place somewhere in Central Asia or in Africa, the United States media, the United States State Department, international institutions would likely refer to this as a coup,” Shahid said . “A billionaire industrialist who donated $300 million to a campaign is installing his personal loyalists in key parts of the federal bureaucracy.” “We need to know: Why does a billionaire industrialist, with millions in government contracts, military contracts for his private companies, need the Social Security numbers of every American, needs to know what every single check that the U.S. government gives out to businesses, to charities? Why does this billionaire need to know this information?” Shahid added.
Moreover, Trump’s administration is reportedly prepping an executive order aimed at dismantling the agency entirely. The U.S. Department of Education is reportedly the next agency in the crosshairs of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency , an Elon Musk-led White House team tasked with slashing government regulation and spending. Roughly 20 people with DOGE are working inside the Department of Education with the aim of cutting spending and staff, The Washington Post reported Monday, citing three unnamed sources familiar with the situation and records the outlet obtained. The Wall Street Journal also reported that representatives from DOGE are working out of the Department of Education building, and sources told the outlet that DOGE is eyeing the agency as a target for its efforts to slash bureaucracy. But in the long term, the Trump administration has even more drastic plans for the department that was established by Congress back in 1979. Both papers report that the administration is prepping an executive order aimed at dismantling the agency entirely. According to the Journal, officials are discussing an executive order that “would shut down all functions of the agency that aren’t written explicitly into statute or move certain functions to other departments” and would also “call for developing a legislative proposal to abolish the department,” according to people familiar with the matter. Timing and specifics are still being hammered out. Because the agency was created by Congress, it therefore can only be fully eliminated by Congress, according to the Post. Musk on Monday night wrote on his platform X that U.S. President Donald Trump’s efforts to fully dismantle the Department of Education “will succeed.” Trump pledged to get rid of the Department of Education on the campaign trail and the priority was also listed among the Heritage Foundation’s “Project 2025” policy proposals. “They want to destroy public education,” wrote Alejandra Caraballo, an instructor at Harvard Law School Cyberlaw Clinic, in response to the Post ’s reporting. Since Trump’s inauguration, Musk and his lieutenants at DOGE have moved swiftly to gain influence over multiple government agencies. Last week, DOGE fired officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development and earlier this week Musk said he intended to shut it down completely. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that he’s now in control of the agency. DOGE representatives were also given access to a Treasury Department payment system that processes trillions of dollars worth of financial transactions and holds personal financial data on millions of Americans. Two unions and an advocacy group sued Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the Treasury Department in federal court Monday for giving DOGE access to the system, citing privacy concerns.
“The scale of the intrusion into individuals’ privacy is massive and unprecedented,” the complaint states. A pair of labor unions and an advocacy group representing retirees sued the U.S. Treasury Department on Monday in an effort to halt Elon Musk’s team’s dangerous access to a critical government payment system — access granted by U.S. President Donald Trump’s handpicked Treasury chief. In a lawsuit filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the Alliance for Retired Americans, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) said they’re seeking to stop the Trump Treasury Department’s “unlawful, ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information” to Musk and members of his so-called Department of Government Efficiency ( DOGE). “The scale of the intrusion into individuals’ privacy is massive and unprecedented,” the complaint states. “Millions of people cannot avoid engaging in financial transactions with the federal government and, therefore, cannot avoid having their sensitive personal and financial information maintained in government records.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s decision last week to give DOGE “full, continuous, and ongoing access to that information for an unspecified period of time means that retirees, taxpayers, federal employees, companies, and other individuals from all walks of life have no assurance that their information will receive the protection that federal law affords,” the lawsuit adds. The coalition urged the court to immediately enjoin the Treasury Department from “continuing to permit such access,” which has sparked calls for Bessent’s impeachment as observers characterize the Musk team’s infiltration of key federal agencies as a coup . “It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has allowed unelected billionaires and their lackeys unfettered access to the personal and financial information of Americans,” AFGE national president Everett Kelley said in a statement Monday. “Together, we can stop this violation of American citizens’ privacy.” Richard Fiesta, executive director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, said that “we are outraged and alarmed that the Trump administration has allowed so-called DOGE staff to violate the law and access millions of older Americans’ sensitive personal and financial data.” “Seniors are already the most vulnerable Americans to fraud and scams, with FBI data showing losses of $3.4 billion in 2023 alone,” Fiesta added. “We urge the court to quickly act to stop this unlawful theft of our data.” The lawsuit was filed as Bessent reportedly assured Republican lawmakers behind closed doors that Musk and his cronies “do not have control over” the Treasury payment system overseen by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. But reporting out Tuesday morning suggests that’s not true. According to Wired , “a 25-year-old engineer named Marko Elez, who previously worked for two Elon Musk companies , has direct access to Treasury Department systems responsible for nearly all payments made by the U.S. government .” Citing unnamed sources, Wired reported that “Elez’s privileges include the ability not just to read but to write code on two of the most sensitive systems in the U.S. government: The Payment Automation Manager (PAM) and Secure Payment System (SPS) at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS).” Researcher Nathan Tankus wrote in his newsletter early Tuesday that “we are in such a catastrophic situation I do not have the words to describe.” “It is getting worse and very little is being done. Lawsuits have been launched to stop this on privacy grounds, but we need so much more. Strongly worded letters from Congress are not enough,” wrote Tankus. “There is a protest at the Treasury today . This is not a newsletter to tell you how to organize or engage in political action. But wherever you are, whatever your context, get involved in resisting the Trump administration’s catastrophic lawlessness and destruction. And get the word out about the Trump-Musk Treasury Payments Crisis of 2025, which is the crisis above all the crises happening concurrently.” At a press conference on Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said that “when unelected billionaires start ransacking our government offices, this is not business as usual.” “We are living a nightmare created by Donald Trump and Elon Musk, and we need to wake up,” Warren added. “We need to use every tool we have to fight back, and in the Senate, we can start by saying no to dangerous Trump nominees like Tulsi Gabbard or Russ Vought.” This story has been updated with new reporting from Wired.
The unelected billionaire has captured vast portions of the federal government, warns strategist Waleed Shahid. Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and unelected adviser to President Donald Trump, is asserting control over much of the federal bureaucracy and sensitive government computer systems despite lacking clear authority. The highest-ranking career official at the Treasury Department was pushed out after refusing to hand Musk’s team the keys to the government’s entire payment system and the $6 trillion in payments the system processes annually, including Social Security checks, tax refunds and Medicare benefits. Musk and his team have also seized control at the Office of Personnel Management and the General Services Administration, key institutions that function as the central nervous system of the U.S. government. “In any other situation, this would be called state capture, and people around the world would be condemning it,” says Democratic strategist Waleed Shahid, who writes in a new blog post that Elon Musk is staging a coup. We also speak with Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, who warns that Musk could be laying the groundwork for major tax cuts Republicans have promised that will disproportionately benefit corporations and wealthy people like him. “Elon Musk is going to pay for his tax cut with your Social Security,” says Owens. This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman. The top-ranking career U.S. Treasury Department official, David Lebryk, has been forced out of the agency after he resisted a demand by Elon Musk and his associates at DOGE to gain access to the government’s vast payment system, which disburses trillions of dollars in federal payments each year. Trump’s new Treasury secretary, the billionaire Scott Bessent, ended up giving Musk access to the system, which includes sensitive information about taxpayers, Social Security recipients, government contractors, including Musk’s rivals. Musk is also accused of waging a takeover at the Office of Personnel Management, where career civil servants have been locked out of computer systems. For more, we’re joined by two guests. Waleed Shahid is a Democratic strategist. His new piece on Substack is headlined “Elon Musk is staging a coup.” Waleed was previously the spokesperson for Justice Democrats and former senior adviser for the campaigns of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman. We’re also joined in Washington, D.C., by Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, who says, “There are several reasons Musk wants to control Treasury payments. None of them are good.” OK, Waleed Shahid, let’s begin with you. What do you mean that Elon Musk is staging a coup? WALEED SHAHID: So, if this story was taking place somewhere in Central Asia or in Africa, the United States media, the United States State Department, international institutions would likely refer to this as a coup. A billionaire industrialist who donated $300 million to a campaign is installing his personal loyalists in key parts of the federal bureaucracy. This is essentially Viktor Orbán’s playbook. And we need to know: Why does a billionaire industrialist, with millions in government contracts, military contracts for his private companies, need the Social Security numbers of every American, needs to know what every single check that the U.S. government gives out to businesses, to charities? Why does this billionaire need to know this information? He was not vetted or approved by the U.S. Senate. He has a history of corruption, for using public resources for private gain. He’s one of the wealthiest men in the world. In any other situation, this would be called state capture, and people around the world would be condemning it. But in the United States, we are not used to this kind of level of creeping authoritarianism, of plutocracy, of oligarchy so explicit. And we need to — as Representative Ocasio-Cortez said last night, this is a five-alarm fire. Senate Democrats need to be communicating to the American people. And last night, there was a call by Indivisible Action for people to visit their local — their senators and call for them to grind the Senate to a halt, to call for investigations and to know why does Elon Musk need to know this information. Why is he showing up on Saturday to the offices of the federal government demanding the private information of citizens all around the country? AMY GOODMAN: Well, Lindsay Owens, you say none of the reasons are good. Lay those out. LINDSAY OWENS: Yeah, absolutely. So, for most Americans, this is the first time that they’ve ever heard of the Treasury payment system. So, what is the Treasury payment system? This is, effectively, the piece of the federal government that cuts the checks. And they cut a lot of checks. This is $6 trillion a year — money that goes to individuals as Social Security payments for seniors; money that goes for organizations like Meals on Wheels to deliver lunches; foreign aid; as well as the funding that the government sets aside for key programs, paying its debts, making sure that we don’t breach the debt ceiling and default on our obligations. So, this is really unprecedented that Elon Musk has grabbed control of the keys of $6 trillion in payments infrastructure. There are a few reasons this could be happening. The first is, as your viewers know, last week, President Trump tried to end federal spending, just stop federal payments altogether. This was so outrageous and in violation of the Constitution that the courts intervened and said that he couldn’t do that. What may be happening here is that Musk may be doing an end run around the courts, going straight to the source so that he can continue to stop those payments that the courts said needed to keep staying online. The second thing that may be happening here is this could just be a good old-fashioned cyberattack. Elon Musk could be interested in the Social Security numbers, the tax ID numbers of tens of millions of Americans. We know that he has partnered with Visa and is considering spinning out a payment system of his own. What we may have here is Elon Musk’s attempt to get the private information for his own financial gain. The other thing that is incredibly worrying here is $6 trillion in spending is not just a lot of money, it’s a macroeconomically significant amount of money. If Elon Musk starts tinkering with the code, you know, the underlying technology that makes sure these payments go out seamlessly and effectively, he could inadvertently, or on purpose, bring the macroeconomy to a halt. I mean, this is an incredibly concerning seizure of government infrastructure, but it is also an economically significant moment in the country. So, I couldn’t agree more with Waleed more. I mean, the word “coup” is the right word to be thinking about here. And Congress must intervene. I mean, if I was a senator, I think the most important thing to do is bring the secretary of the treasury to the Senate today to answer questions about what Musk has access to. AMY GOODMAN: So, the Treasury Department’s inspector general, who could monitor DOGE’s activities, was among the 15 watchdogs who were purged by President Trump. Who’s now in charge of or overseeing Musk’s team? LINDSAY OWENS: Yeah, Musk is in charge. So, that’s exactly right. Some of the key chokeholds here to make sure that something like this doesn’t happen have been moved out of the way, studiously, exactingly moved out of the way. So, President Trump fired the inspector general of the Treasury, and the top civil servant of the Treasury Department, the man who was the acting treasury secretary between the time that Janet Yellen stepped down and Scott Bessent was confirmed by the Senate, has also been pushed aside, resigned over the fact that he didn’t want to give Musk, a private citizen, a billionaire, the keys to the Treasury payment system. So there is very little stopping Musk from taking this over. You know, Trump and Bessent have really given him a glide path. AMY GOODMAN: So, Waleed Shahid, where is the Democratic Party on this? Where are the Democratic senators and congressmembers on this? I mean, you have Hakeem Jeffries, who holds an emergency meeting of the Democrats after a judge stops the federal payments from going out to — you know, stops the ban on federal funding. WALEED SHAHID: So, the Democratic Party in Washington is largely asleep at the wheel. They are acting as if they’re kind of a librarian shushing noise in a crowded room. They are still believing in the normal procedures, normal decorum, normal — that everything here is the normal transition of power. And they still believe that what Elon Musk and Donald Trump are doing is just a libertarian reform of the government, not an oligarchic, plutocratic takeover of a private billionaire who is seeking to know — potentially seeking to know what his competitors might be doing with government contracts. He has private information that — Elon Musk has contracts with international governments all across the world. But the Democratic Party is not able to put forward an opposition message right now, because they are — they feel like this is normal. And that’s why it’s so important for concerned citizens all across the country to twist the arm of your Senate Democrat. Go to their office. If you go to Indivisible.org today, you can find a way to join your local chapter all around the country, whether your senators are Republican or Democrat or independent. They need to hear from concerned citizens, because the Democratic Party doesn’t move on issues of oligarchy, of plutocracy, of taking action, unless their constituents show up in person and demand that they hold hearings, take the bully pulpit in the media and also grind the Senate to a halt until we know why does Elon Musk have this information, someone who was not elected. AMY GOODMAN: So, the Democratic National Committee on Saturday elected the moderate political insider Ken Martin as chair, despite calls from voters to urgently switch gears and respond to working people’s needs following the party’s crushing defeat, though it wasn’t a major numbers defeat, but it was a defeat in November. What do you think of Ken Martin? Where do you think it’s going? WALEED SHAHID: So, the DNC is largely, at this point, a fundraising vehicle for the presidential campaign. I hope that Ken Martin reforms the party to do things like what I’m describing. The Democratic Party should be holding daily press conferences every morning to explain to working-class and middle-class Americans why it might hurt their pocketbooks for Elon Musk to have this information from the Treasury Department and from the OPM, that Elon Musk has a history of wanting to use public resources for private gain, that Elon Musk is someone who is live-tweeting that he wants to cut the federal government’s debt every day by billions of dollars, and one of the only ways to do that would be to begin to privatize Social Security. This is what the DNC should be doing. Now, Ken Martin, we had lots of members of the “uncommitted” movement at the DNC who were being personally bullied by their DNC state parties, and Ken Martin, thankfully, did intervene to make sure that that didn’t happen. And so, that was my only personal interaction with him, and he went out of his way to make sure that our uncommitted delegation was treated with respect. Other than that, I don’t know that much about him, but I’m looking forward to — hopefully he can put together a working-class, populist agenda for the party that isn’t just a fundraising handoff. AMY GOODMAN: So, Lindsay Owens, DOGE is not a formal government agency, right? Which means that it doesn’t fall into any category. LINDSAY OWENS: Yeah, look, I think when President Trump announced that Elon Musk was going to be running the Department of Government Efficiency, there was a sort of tempting fantasy that maybe Musk, a tech but successful businessman, could come in and restore some efficiency in government, maybe modernize some aspects of government that could use some updating. I mean, I think with this weekend’s seizure of the Treasury payment system, we can be crystal clear in putting that fantasy to bed. This is Musk determining who is going to get funding in this country, what programs are going to be funded in this country. And remember, Musk isn’t a disinterested party here. As we’ve talked about, he has many federal contracts himself, billions of dollars this year alone to his companies — SpaceX, Tesla and X, formerly known as Twitter. But he also is interested in cutting this funding for a very personal reason, which is he is interested in paying for the tax cuts that Congress is teeing up this year. They are estimating $5 trillion in tax cuts, mostly going to the wealthy and corporations. And DOGE is the entity that is supposedly going to find the money, find the savings to pay for those tax cuts. So I think we can sum it up this way: Elon Musk is going to pay for his tax cut with your Social Security. That’s really what we’re looking at here. That’s what DOGE is up to. And I think we can put aside — AMY GOODMAN: Lindsay Owens, we’re going to have to leave it there. And I just want to give Waleed the last word. Ten seconds. What should people do right now? WALEED SHAHID: People should go to Indivisible.org and visit their Senate office and demand an investigation of Elon Musk and that Senate business should come to a halt. AMY GOODMAN: We want to thank Waleed Shahid, Democratic strategist. We’ll link to his piece , “Elon Musk is staging a coup.” And, Lindsay Owens, thanks for joining us, from Groundwork Collaborative, and your piece , “There are several reasons Musk wants to control Treasury payments. None of them are good,” she writes. I’m Amy Goodman. Thanks for joining us.
USAID officials were forced out after refusing to give Musk agents access to internal systems and classified material. The unelected billionaire given free rein to tear through the federal government said early Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump agrees with the ongoing push to shutter the United States Agency for International Development, the single-largest contributor of humanitarian assistance worldwide. Elon Musk , the head of an outside advisory commission that has trampled the law as its agents work to access and take over critical government operations , said during an event broadcast on the social media platform he owns that he has checked with Trump “a few times” about whether he wants USAID shut down. According to Musk, Trump replied, “Yes.” “So we’re shutting it down,” said Musk, who claimed the agency is run by “radical lunatics.” Over the weekend, as Common Dreams reported , two USAID security officials were forced out after they refused to give Musk agents access to internal systems and classified material. USAID’s website has also gone dark, an ominous development for an agency that has become one of the Trump administration’s top targets. In addition to the grave political implications of Musk’s maneuvers—which one observer described as a “textbook coup” — humanitarian Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America warned in a statement that “dismantling USAID would be a callous, destructive political power play that would have deadly consequences for millions of people living in dire humanitarian emergencies and extreme poverty.” “Any attempt by President Trump to dissolve or merge USAID with the State Department would be legally dubious and must be swiftly challenged in court,” Maxman added. The Trump administration has already instituted a sweeping pause on foreign aid distributions, sparking chaos and panic around the world as charitable organizations scramble to understand the consequences for their lifesaving work. “One had to decide whether to abide by a stop-work order or deliver lunches to schoolchildren in impoverished communities, as it has for years,” TIME reported . “It decided to obey the order, wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of perishable food. Another is figuring out whether to close health clinics for pregnant mothers in Haiti, leaving them with scant alternatives for a place to give birth.” Reports indicate the Trump administration has discussed plans to “strip a slimmed-down U.S. Agency for International Development of its independence and put it under State Department control.” By Saturday, according to The New York Times , “lawmakers had received word that at least some of the USAID signs at the agency’s headquarters in downtown Washington had come down, and rumors were circling that mission directors around the world were being called back to the United States.” “Two USAID employees, who work in the Washington headquarters and spoke on condition of anonymity because of an order barring employees from discussing any changes to the agency, said that they were working under an atmosphere of fear and chaos, and that half of the agency’s workforce had been eliminated in the last week,” the Times added. Paul O’Brien, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said in a statement that “governments around the world are significantly better equipped to meet their human rights obligations because of the technical and financial resources USAID provides.” “An abrupt collapse of the agency,” O’Brien warned, “would put the rights of millions of people around the world at greater risk as a result.” Progressive strategist and organizer Waleed Shahid wrote over the weekend that “if this were Pakistan, Chad, or Venezuela, the headlines wouldn’t hedge: A billionaire oligarch seizes control, dismantling democracy in real time.” “Musk’s loyalists, armed with executive orders instead of rifles, are gutting the civil service, locking officials out of government systems, and dictating policy from a boardroom-turned-war room,” Shahid continued. “Trump, a fading strongman, is the figurehead; Musk, the junta’s real leader. Treasury, national security, and federal agencies — one by one, falling under private rule. In any other country, experts would call it state capture, a textbook coup. Here, the press still asks if democracy is in danger, as if waiting for the moment history makes it undeniable.”
“Congress famously has the power of the purse,” wrote one analyst, “but it looks like DOGE is trying to snatch it.” “Congress famously has the power of the purse,” wrote one analyst, “but it looks like DOGE is trying to snatch it.” Reporting Friday that aides to Elon Musk — the billionaire backer of Republican President Donald Trump who runs the Department of Government Efficiency — locked career civil servants out of computer systems containing the personal data of millions of federal employees raised alarms among observers who said the move is consistent with the administration’s efforts to assert authoritarian control over the federal government. An unnamed official at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) told Reuters that “we have no visibility” into what Musk aides “are doing with the computer and data systems,” and “that is creating great concern.” “There is no oversight,” the official said, adding that “it creates real cybersecurity and hacking implications.” No one elected Musk and he holds no official position—and yet:“Aides to Elon Musk charged with running the US government human resources agency have locked career civil servants out of computer systems that contain the personal data of millions of federal employees”www.reuters.com/world/us/mus… The Reuters report came on the same day that The Washington Post reported that David Lebryk, who has worked in nonpolitical positions at the U.S. Treasury Department since the George H.W. Bush administration, will retire following “a clash with allies of billionaire Elon Musk over access to sensitive payment systems.” As the Post noted: Run by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the sensitive systems control the flow of more than $6 trillion annually to households, businesses, and more nationwide. Tens, if not hundreds, of millions of people across the country rely on the systems, which are responsible for distributing Social Security and Medicare benefits, salaries for federal personnel, payments to government contractors and grant recipients, and tax refunds, among tens of thousands of other functions. The clash reflects an intensifying battle between Musk and the federal bureaucracy as the Trump administration nears the conclusion of its second week. Musk has sought to exert sweeping control over the inner workings of the U.S. government, installing longtime surrogates at several agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management, which essentially handles federal human resources, and the General Services Administration, which manages real estate. On Friday, the Trump administration ordered the General Services Administration to create a plan to slash 50% from the independent agency’s budget, according to journalist Ken Klippenstein, who reported senior officials were left looking “‘shell-shocked'” by the directive. 🚨Trump administration just ordered the General Services Administration to develop a plan to cut 50% of its current budget, multiple officials tell me. "Our SES looked shell shocked," one official told me. "I expect this was a result of Musk's visit to HQ… Lebryk’s announcement underscored what critics have warned is an aggressive push by Musk and other unelected Trump acolytes to sideline civil servants as part of an agenda in which MAGA sycophants are empowered to weaken government checks and balances and ensure total loyalty to the president, who has repeatedly flirted with authoritarianism . In a Friday article highlighting Lebryk’s announcement, Gizmodo ’s Matt Novak reported that “while it’s not clear why wants access, experts are alarmed because there’s basically no plausible explanation that doesn’t involve tinkering with critical government functions by sidestepping Congress.” “Lebryk’s departure is apparently related to the interference by DOGE-affiliated goons to access these payment systems,” Novak asserted. Common Dreams reported earlier this week that Trump loyalists in the OPM and Office of Management and Budget associated with Project 2025 — the Heritage Foundation-led blueprint for a far-right takeover of the federal government — are leading a sweeping effort to purge career civil servants and replace them with officials who will do the president’s bidding without question. Don Moynihan, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ford School of Public Policy, told Reuters Friday that “this makes it much harder for anyone outside Musk’s inner circle at OPM to know what’s going on.” Despite its name, DOGE is a presidential advisory committee, not a federal department — and critics including Novak have accused the billionaire Trump supporter of reaching “his tentacles into virtually every agency.” “Congress famously has the power of the purse,” he wrote. “But it looks like DOGE is trying to snatch it.” Earlier this week, Congressman Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), the ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, warned that Trump “is trying every trick he and his Project 2025 cronies can think of to circumvent established civil service protections so they can purge the civil service of experts and replace them with political loyalists.” “The victims here, as is always the case with Donald Trump, are the American people who will see government services and benefits allocated not by nonpartisan civil servants, but by partisan hacks,” Connolly added. Mark Mazur, who served in senior Treasury Department roles during the Obama and Biden administrations, told the Post Friday that the prospect of government officials using the federal payments system in service of personal political motives is without precedent. “It’s never been used in a way to execute a partisan agenda,” Mazur stressed. “You have to really put bad intentions in place for that to be the case.”
New reporting raises concerns that Musk wants to control Medicare and Social Security through access to payment systems. President Donald Trump has claimed the spending cuts he proposes won’t impact Medicare and Social Security, but new reporting on the sudden departure of the U.S. Treasury Department’s highest-ranking career official after a dispute over the payment systems that distribute those benefits sparked concern that Trump’s billionaire backer, Elon Musk , could have plans for the popular programs relied on by millions of Americans. The Washington Post reported Friday that David Lebryk, who has served in numerous high-level roles at the Treasury Department since 1989 and was temporarily named acting treasury secretary by Trump before the confirmation this week of his nominee, Scott Bessent, would soon leave the department. According to the newspaper, Lebryk has clashed with allies of Musk, whom Trump has named to lead his new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), over access to payment systems that the agency uses to distribute more than $6 trillion annually to households and businesses. Social Security and Medicare benefits, paychecks for federal employees, and payments to government contractors and grant recipients all flow through the payment systems run by the Bureau of Fiscal Service, among thousands of other functions. Since Trump won the election in November, officials Musk has named as DOGE staffers have been asking for access to the payment systems, and the demands have been reiterated since the president took office last week, the Post reported. Mark Mazur, who served in the department under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, said the push for access to the systems from an advisory committee aligned with a partisan agenda suggests “bad intentions” from Musk and his allies. “This is a mechanical job—they pay Social Security benefits, they pay vendors, whatever,” said Mazur. “It’s not one where there’s a role for nonmechanical things, at least from the career standpoint. Your whole job is to pay the bills as they’re due. It’s never been used in a way to execute a partisan agenda.” Since Trump’s inauguration, the new administration has signaled its desire to disrupt government funding of long-established programs, most notably when the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memo directing federal agencies to “pause all activities related to obligations or disbursement of all federal financial assistance.” That memo, which was later rescinded , raised alarm about a freeze on the funding of programs like Head Start, Meals on Wheels, and Medicaid. The executive order that created DOGE last week ordered agencies to ensure the advisory body has “full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems.” DOGE’s push for access to the Bureau of Fiscal Services payment systems suggests that it also wants control of those mechanisms. Lindsay Owens, executive director of the progressive advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative , said the dispute that led to Lebryk’s imminent departure showed that “the Trump administration’s claims that they won’t touch Social Security and Medicare are obviously lies.” “Musk and his DOGE cronies are already demanding unprecedented access to the payment system that distributes these funds and are ousting any civil servant who gets in their way,” said Owens. “It’s barely been two weeks and Musk has already caused a level of chaos and inefficiency we’ve never before seen in government.” The idea that “good government technocrats could work with Musk and DOGE to improve technology and services” has been proven to be “all grift,” added Owens in a post on Musk’s social media platform, X. I know that it is nice to believe in a fantasy in which good government technocrats could work with Musk and DOGE to improve technology and services. But when the evidence that supports the alternate theory—that this is all grift—keeps piling up you have to update your priors. While advocates and lawmakers have said DOGE could work to reduce military spending, which has risen by 50% since the beginning of the 21st century and hit $820 billion in 2023 despite the Pentagon failing seven consecutive audits, the Trump administration has appeared laser-focused in its first weeks on addressing spending that impacts millions of low-income and working Americans. “Elon Musk, who NO ONE VOTED FOR, wants to mess with our earned benefits,” said Social Security Works , an advocacy group that works to protect the benefit for retired Americans. “Hell no.”
In the wake of a deadly air disaster, Trump and Musk aim to gut the federal workforce and eliminate regulatory efforts. As President Donald Trump attempted to vilify diversity initiatives in the wake of the worst U.S. air disaster in decades , progressives warned that the true threat to aviation safety going forward is Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s shared goal of gutting the federal workforce and eliminating regulatory efforts that have helped make flying the nation’s least dangerous form of transportation. “We need to learn more about what happened and how to prevent this type of catastrophe in the future,” Joel Payne, chief communications officer at MoveOn Civil Action, said in a statement Thursday. “But one thing is for sure — our air safety and disaster response relies on the same type of federal funding and resources that Donald Trump and his right-wing billionaire backers like Elon Musk have been moving to cut.” Echoing others, Payne noted since Trump’s second term began less than two weeks ago, he implemented a hiring freeze that appears to include air traffic controllers and dismantled the Aviation Security Advisory Committee. Payne also pointed to Musk’s role in leaving the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) without a permanent leader following the collision of a passenger jet and Army helicopter that killed 64 people. “There are real consequences for the American people from the chaos and mismanagement that we have already seen since Trump took office,” said Payne. “As we work to learn the lessons of this tragedy, we need Trump, his allies, and his administration to end their assault on the public services that are essential to keeping us safe.” Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) similarly argued that “what actually hurts aviation safety” is “purging the federal workforce of career public servants and experts who have spent their entire lives working to keep the American people safe.” The National Transportation Safety Board is expected to release a preliminary report on the deadly collision within 30 days as investigators work to determine the immediate causes of the catastrophic incident. As Common Dreams reported , the FAA indicated Thursday that air traffic control staffing was “not normal” at the time of the collision. Air traffic control understaffing is a nationwide problem that analysts said could be exacerbated by the new administration’s far-reaching attacks on federal workers and funding. “The government is a complex and delicate system. Letting Elon Musk thrash around inside it like some silage-drunk bull in a red-cape factory will cause untold damage,” The American Prospect ’s Ryan Cooper wrote Thursday. “The details are still being investigated. It’s too early in the process for the crash to be definitively pinned on the policies of Trump and Musk. But if we want more airline disasters, Trump and Musk are on just the right collision course.”
This brings Tesla’s average tax rate over the past three years to 0.4 percent. Elon Musk’s Tesla paid a total of $0 in federal income taxes in 2024, new tax reports show, despite the company having raked in billions of dollars in income and being the most valuable car company in the world. Citing Tesla’s year-end financial report released this week, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) reports that Tesla paid a 0 percent federal income tax rate last year, even as the company reported $2.3 billion in income. In 2023, Tesla paid $48 million in taxes on $3.1 billion in income — a 1.5 percent rate. And, in 2022, when it reported $5.5 billion in income, Tesla also paid a 0 percent tax rate. This brings Tesla’s average tax rate over the past three years to 0.4 percent, or 50 times less than the statutory corporate tax rate of 21 percent. This is despite the fact that Tesla is valued at over $1.2 trillion and is owned by the richest man in the world, with a net worth of over $400 billion and who was awarded a $101 billion pay package by Tesla shareholders last year — though this package has been rejected by a judge. Due to the nature of the U.S. tax system, which heavily favors corporations and the wealthy and enables sophisticated tax dodging methods, Musk is also one of the many ultrarich Americans who pay a far lower tax rate than the average American. Advocates for fairer taxation have said that, due to the way that tax law is written and enforced, it is essentially optional for Musk and other billionaires to follow tax guidelines, allowing them to hoard more and more wealth while the working class struggles to get by. According to ITEP, Tesla was able to avoid paying $500 million in taxes by using accelerated depreciation, a tax avoidance method and incentive for businesses which allows companies to write off the costs of an asset faster than it would normally actually lose value. The company dodged another $300 million in its tax bill by claiming “unspecified ‘U.S. tax credits,’” ITEP said. Companies’ ability to use accelerated depreciation as a tax avoidance method was expanded by Donald Trump and Republicans’ Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, which slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent and has supercharged the growth of the wealth gap in the U.S., creating an explosion of wealth for the richest Americans. Trump and the GOP have pledged to be extremely friendly to corporations in Trump’s second term in office. The president campaigned on tax cuts across the board — but research has found that his tax plans would actually raise taxes for the working class while cutting taxes for the top 5 percent richest Americans. Meanwhile, Republicans are reportedly circulating options to expand the already massive tax benefits given to corporations and the wealthy in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — options that include slashing benefits for working class Americans in order to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. This could give massive corporations like Tesla yet more tax cuts. ITEP points out that there are also bipartisan proposals to give corporations more tax dodging tools, like a compromise bill proposed in the Senate last year that would, among other things, retroactively give companies the ability to receive a tax break on supposed research — though the bill gives an extremely wide definition of what a company could qualify as research.
One 20-year Office of Personnel Management employee called the moves “a hostile takeover of the federal civil service.” The unglamorous but key federal office that sent out a mass “deferred resignation” offer to federal employees on Tuesday has reportedly been taken over by people with ties to Elon Musk , the world’s richest man and a close confidant of U.S. President Donald Trump . Citing unnamed sources, Wired reported Tuesday that “the highest ranks of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) — essentially the human resources function for the entire federal government — are now controlled by people with connections to Musk and to the tech industry.” Musk reportedly visited OPM headquarters late last week. Wired , which described the individuals as “Musk lackeys,” declined to name some of the newly installed OPM officials because of their ages. One of the officials “was set to start college last fall,” and another “is a 21-year-old whose online résumé touts his work for Palantir, the government contractor and analytics firm co-founded by billionaire Peter Thiel.” Among the officials the outlet names are Riccardo Biasini, a former Tesla engineer who is now a senior adviser to the OPM director, and Amanda Scales, who previously worked at xAI, Musk’s artificial intelligence company. Scales is now chief of staff at OPM, which is currently led by Acting Director Charles Ezell. A since-deleted Reddit post purportedly authored by an OPM employee describes Ezell as “the friendliest ‘yes man’ you’ll ever meet.” “I’ve been an OPM employee for nearly a decade and a federal employee for almost 20 years. I’ve never witnessed anything even remotely close to what’s happening right now. In short, there’s a hostile takeover of the federal civil service,” the post stated. “It’s clear they pushed aside all the high-level nonpolitical civil servants who refused to do Donald Trump’s bidding, until they found Chuck .” The heavy presence of Musk allies and associates at OPM further entrenches the influence of the mega-billionaire inside the Trump administration, which has moved swiftly — and unlawfully — to purge the federal workforce and exert control over funding approved by Congress. The American Prospect ’s David Dayen noted Wednesday that the email OPM sent to federal employees earlier this week offering full pay and benefits through September for all workers who opt to resign was “an Elon Musk operation, through and through.” “In fact, the ‘Fork in the Road’ email had the same title as one that Elon Musk sent to Twitter when he took over there, informing workers to be ‘extremely hardcore’ or take the resignation offer,” Dayen wrote. “The Twitter emails even included the same ask of workers to reply with their decision.” “This is alternately questionably legal, potentially a bait and switch, dubiously effective as a budget-reducer, maybe even a budget-buster, and definitively harrowing for two million workers being subjected to a misery-inducing campaign for the sport of the world’s richest man,” Dayen added.
Musk has enthusiastically backed AfD, an anti-immigrant party accused of minimizing Nazi crimes and using Nazi slogans. Musk has enthusiastically backed AfD, an anti-immigrant party accused of minimizing Nazi crimes and using Nazi slogans. Billionaire Elon Musk made virtual appearance at a Saturday campaign event for the far-right Alternative for Germany party — known by the initials AfD — ahead of a snap federal election in Germany next month. The campaign appearance comes less than a week after Musk was accused of performing a Nazi salute twice on stage at a post-inauguration celebration for U.S. President Donal Trump. “A nazi speaking at a nazi rally. It’s really not deeper than that,” wrote the independent journalist Marisa Kabas on Saturday. Musk has endorsed the AfD, known for its strong anti-immigrant stance, and earlier this month hosted AfD co-leader Alice Weidel — who was also at Saturday’s campaign event — for an interview on his platform X. Members of the AfD have been accused of downplaying the crimes of Nazi Germany and using Nazi slogans. Musk told onlookers at the event, which took place in Halle, that he thinks AfD is the best hope for Germany and said that it’s good to be proud of German culture, according to Reuters and The Guardian. “It’s good to be proud of German culture, German values, and not to lose that in some sort of multiculturalism that dilutes everything,” Musk said, according to Reuters , addressing the crowd via a live video. “Children should not be guilty of the sins of their parents, let alone their great grandparents,” Musk also said, which, per Reuters, apparently referred to Germany’s Nazi past. Musk’s “Nazi-like salutes” earlier this week drew sharp rebuke from some, but not all. The Anti-Defamation League, an organization whose mission is to combat antisemitism, called the move “an awkward gesture” and “not a Nazi salute.” For his part, Musk wrote on X that the reaction was an example of Democratic “dirty tricks.” He also said that “the ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.” Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah, reacting to the news of Musk’s appearance at the rally, wrote that “all the people who were shrugging and equivocating over Elon and whether he was aligning with Nazi, far-right forces should be launched into the sun. May they never be taken seriously again.”
“Elon is a great friend of Israel,” Netanyahu said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come to Elon Musk’s defense after the billionaire performed a salute at Donald Trump’s inauguration that is being widely celebrated by neo-Nazis as a Nazi salute. In a post on social media, Netanyahu said that Musk is being “falsely smeared” and suggested that Musk’s support of Israel is proof that he isn’t antisemitic — even as numerous Jewish and anti-hate groups and observers have said that Musk’s now-infamous salute was clearly a Nazi salute. “Elon is a great friend of Israel,” Netanyahu wrote. “He visited Israel after the October 7 massacre in which Hamas terrorists committed the worst atrocity against the Jewish people since the Holocaust. He has since repeatedly and forcefully supported Israel’s right to defend itself against genocidal terrorists and regimes who seek to annihilate the one and only Jewish state.” “I thank him for this,” Netanyahu concluded. Like Musk’s salute, Netanyahu’s statement immediately drew backlash, with critics saying that the Israeli leader’s embrace of Musk demonstrates that his top priority is not fighting antisemitism, but continuing Israel’s colonization of Palestine. “Elon Musk saluted a Sieg Heil — evoking fear for millions and broadcasting hate and violence, not only for Jews, but for many others,” said Jewish Voice for Peace in reaction to Netanyahu’s post. “But for the Israeli government, all that matters is that Musk supports its Jewish supremacist project of apartheid and ongoing genocide against Palestinians,” the group went on. “The Israeli alliance with fascists and Nazis across the globe is the inevitable direction of a violent apartheid state that manipulates the history of Jewish people in order to carry out ethnic cleansing.” Indeed, many experts have said that Musk’s salute — which he performed twice in a row — was unambiguously a Nazi gesture. Neo-Nazis expressed excitement about the salute, celebrating it as a major win within neo-Nazi and white supremacist networks. Meanwhile, the fiercely pro-Israel Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which brands itself as an antisemitism watchdog, has defended Musk , saying the salute was merely an “awkward gesture.” The ADL has defended Musk before, when he has levied attacks against the movement for Palestinian rights. In the early months of the Gaza genocide, ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt praised Musk when he decided to censor pro-Palestinian terms and the word “decolonization” on X. “I appreciate this leadership in fighting hate,” Greenblatt said. Greenblatt’s statement came just days after Musk had endorsed virulently antisemitic conspiracy theories, including the long-debunked, white supremacist “great replacement” theory . For years, progressives have denounced Musk for espousing antisemitic and hateful views. Recently, he endorsed the far right, neo-Nazi German political party Alternative for Germany, whose party leaders have minimized or denied the Holocaust, among other antisemitic acts. Indeed, amid the backlash to his salute, Musk made yet more antisemitic statements on Thursday, this time posting crass jokes making light of the Holocaust. “Don’t say Hess to Nazi accusations! Some people will Goebbels anything down! Stop Gőring your enemies! His pronouns would’ve been He/Himmler! Bet you did nazi that coming,” Musk wrote in a post on X, adding a laughing emoji. This time, Greenblatt condemned Musk, saying, “We’ve said it hundreds of times before and we will say it again: the Holocaust was a singularly evil event, and it is inappropriate and offensive to make light of it. @elonmusk, the Holocaust is not a joke.”
Musk has promoted antisemitic and white nationalist content online, and has endorsed a neo-Nazi party in Germany. A well-liked weather anchor in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has been fired for making a post on her personal social media account condemning Elon Musk for making a hand gesture that many observers have said appeared to be a Nazi salute. Milwaukee CBS affiliate station WDJT-TV, also known as CBS58, fired meteorologist Sam Kuffel for comments she made this week on her Instagram . Staff were notified of her termination in an email on Wednesday. “Meteorologist Sam Kuffel is no longer employed at CBS58. A search for a replacement is underway,” the memo read . Kuffel’s post received widespread attention after Milwaukee-based conservative radio host Dan O’Donnell shared it with his followers , prompting many to call for her termination. Kuffel’s comments did not appear in any newscast, nor did she share her thoughts on her official social media pages. “Dude Nazi saluted twice. TWICE. During the inauguration,” Kuffel wrote in one of her posts, referring to Elon Musk’s hand gesture at Trump’s inauguration. In a second post, Kuffel shared images of Musk doing the hand motion and a screenshot of a character from “Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” with the caption: “Screw that old bitch. He’s a Nazi.” Kuffel added : You fucking with this and this man, I don’t fuck with you. Full stop. After O’Donnell shared her posts, Kuffel made her account private. She has not shared any additional information since her termination. Social media has been inundated with posts responding to Musk’s hand gesture. Musk has downplayed the action and denied that it was Nazi-esque, calling complaints about it “dirty tricks.” He also complained that “the ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.” Experts in the history of fascist and authoritarian movements have said that Musk’s gesture was the same as the hand motion used to salute Hitler in Nazi Germany. “Historian of fascism here. It was a Nazi salute and a very belligerent one too,” New York University professor Ruth Ben-Ghiat said in a post on Bluesky . German people have also weighed in on Musk’s hand gesture, with many saying that it appeared to be a Nazi salute. “Whoever on a political stage, making a political speech in front of a partly far-right audience, elongates his arm diagonally in the air both forcefully and repeatedly, is making a Hitler salute,” wrote Lenz Jacobsen , a journalist for the German publication Die Zeit . “There’s no such ‘probably’ or ‘similar to’ or ‘controversial’ about it. The gesture speaks for itself.” White nationalists in the U.S. similarly recognized Musk’s hand gesture as a Nazi salute — and celebrated his use of the gesture on a national stage. Musk’s hand movement “wasn’t even like, like a subtle — like a wave,” white nationalist Nick Fuentes said in a recent interview , noting that the billionaire’s arm went “straight up like ‘Sieg Heil.'” Notably, Musk has frequently expressed support for far right and antisemitic views. In 2022, Musk purchased the social media platform X — then known as Twitter — for the purpose of making it open to all forms of “free speech,” claiming the company had been banning accounts with extreme right-wing views. Since Musk’s takeover, the platform has become a bastion for far right content , including antisemitic conspiracy theories. In 2023, Musk shared a post on the site from a user who claimed that Jewish people push a “hatred against Whites.” The post also pushed the white nationalist “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which falsely purports that Jewish leaders around the world are trying to dilute white populations by introducing nonwhite immigrants to their countries. This past fall, Musk shared an interview by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson in which his guest falsely suggested that the Nazi Holocaust during World War II was accidental and had been brought about by aggressive behavior from the Allied powers. Musk shared a video of the interview, calling it “very interesting” and “worth watching,” only to delete the post after it was met with widespread criticism. And late last year, Musk announced his support for Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far right neo-Nazi party in that country’s parliamentary elections in February. AfD is vehemently anti-immigrant and pro-German “identity,” with its leaders frequently expressing anti-Muslim and antisemitic viewpoints. They have also downplayed and outright denied the Holocaust, and have called for German school books to be rewritten to limit criticism of the Nazi party. Following her termination from the Milwaukee news station, many Milwaukee area- and Wisconsin-based voices spoke out in support of Kuffel. “It is very troubling that a weather reporter was fired, rather than disciplined (if at all) for a social media post unrelated to her particular beat. … In the past such an indiscretion would have perhaps merited a scolding, or a suspension,” journalist Michael Horne said . “I think the higher-ups in the corporate chain may have required this draconian response, tarnishing a young professional’s career, all for fear of Trump.” “There are a lot of good reporters at CBS 58. I hope management understands that firing their own employees for the benefit of far-right billionaires like Musk is a dangerous road to go down,” Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan, who represents a district about an hour’s drive west of Milwaukee, said on Facebook . “Shame on @CBS58 for firing Sam Kuffel for naming @elonmusk’s Nazi salute. This dark chapter of our country’s history will eventually be over and we’ll all remember who showed integrity & who didn’t,” Milwaukee photographer Isaac Rowlett said on X .
Trump’s economic team is a “recipe for disaster,” according to Americans for Tax Fairness Executive Director David Kass. Super rich individuals in President Donald Trump’s economic policy team will not have the interests of working-class Americans in mind when they make important decisions, a new report from Americans for Tax Fairness warns. The report examines the net worth of Trump’s economic policy advisers , which includes nominees to lead the Treasury and Commerce Departments and individuals who will serve on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Small Business Administration, and other agencies. The average net worth of the top 10 richest individuals who will be advising the president on economic matters is over $500 million, the report noted . Among the top five, the average net worth reaches $1 billion. With that kind of wealth, it will be nearly impossible for Trump’s advisers to make decisions that address the needs of workers, Americans for Tax Fairness Executive Director David Kass explained. “Billionaires making economic policy for working families is a recipe for disaster. An economy and tax code that are already rigged to benefit the wealthy and well-connected will just be twisted more in their favor,” said Kass . “At a time when Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, housing, education and other services vital to average Americans are under threat, Trump’s proposed ‘Solid Gold’ economic team will be pushing tax cuts mostly for themselves and their friends that will run up almost $5 trillion in extra debt.” Only one member on the list of economic policy advisers identified by the organization could feasibly be categorized as “middle class” — Andrew Ferguson, Trump’s pick to be chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), who has a reported net worth of around $150,000 . But FTC commission members earn an income of around $158,000 annually , meaning the report by Americans for Tax Fairness is likely undervaluing Ferguson’s worth, given that his annual salary is nearly three times greater than the median American income. Billionaires are prominent in Trump’s cabinet , not only within his team of economic advisers, but also within various other departments. Trump’s decision to surround himself with some of the richest people in the country showcases his determination to accelerate the U.S. government’s descent into overt oligarchy, as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) has pointed out . The most recognizable billionaire in Trump’s administration is Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, who is set to lead the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency,” which is ostensibly tasked with finding and cutting trillions of dollars in waste within the government. Members of the Trump administration have indicated that Musk will likely take aim at government programs that help low-income Americans — including programs like Social Security , Medicaid and Medicare .
The ruling affords billionaires unprecedented political power as the rest of us pay the price, says an expert. President Donald Trump’s return to the White House comes almost exactly 15 years after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark Citizens United ruling, which opened the floodgates for corporations and billionaires to pour unlimited money into elections. At Trump’s inauguration on Monday, the front row included several of the world’s richest and most powerful men, including Tesla’s Elon Musk, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook and Google’s Sundar Pichai. Their collective net worth is over $1 trillion. For more on money in politics and the legacy of Citizens United , we speak with Brendan Fischer, the deputy executive director at Documented, an investigative watchdog and journalism project. “Democrats and Republicans have both embraced super PACs and embraced the megadonors that fund them, but Trump is taking this to another level,” says Fischer, who notes that about 44% of Trump’s election was funded by just 10 megadonors. This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: I want to bring in our next guest. President Trump’s return to the White House comes 15 years to the week after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark Citizens United ruling, which opened the floodgates for billionaires like Elon Musk to pour unlimited money into elections. At Trump’s inauguration on Monday, Elon Musk was given a prime seat, along with Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook, Google’s Sundar Pichai. Vermont independent Senator Bernie Sanders commented, “When the three wealthiest men in America sit behind Trump at his inauguration, everyone understands that the billionaire class now controls our government,” unquote. We go now to Brendan Fischer, deputy executive director at Documented, lawyer with expertise in campaign finance and government transparency issues. He has a new article out today in Rolling Stone headlined “Blame the Supreme Court for Elon Musk’s Power in Trump’s Administration.” Talk about the significance of this week, Brendan, the 15th anniversary of Citizens United . And for people who don’t understand what it is, trace the trajectory of the Supreme Court decision right through to the power of Elon Musk in the White House today. BRENDAN FISCHER: Sure. And thank you for having me, Amy and Juan. So, everything that Rob Weissman just described is entirely accurate. And it’s a result — Musk’s astonishing influence over Trump and this new administration, you know, is not just a result of his right-wing celebrity, his personal wealth, his ownership of X. It’s largely attributable to Musk having poured over a quarter-billion dollars into the 2024 election cycle. And almost all of that spending would have been impossible before Citizens United . Citizens United struck down limits on, quote-unquote, “independent” political spending, and it opened the door to super PACs and dark money groups that billionaires like Musk have used to pour this astonishing amount of money into U.S. elections. And Musk’s ability to translate his economic power into political power is what offers him this very privileged and powerful position in the incoming administration. And that’s going to benefit Musk, and the rest of us are likely to pay the price. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Brendan, I think OpenSecrets reported that about more than 40% of the total money raised by Trump came from just 10 individuals in the country. Have we ever experienced a presidency so beholden to such a small group of people? BRENDAN FISCHER: This is unprecedented. It’s certainly true that every election cycle since the 2010 Citizens United decision has been more expensive than the last. Democrats and Republicans have both embraced super PACs and embraced the megadonors that fund them. But Trump is taking this to another level. As you said, over 44% of the money raised to support Trump came from just 10 donors, and Musk being one of the top few. And, you know, that’s not something we’ve seen before. We’ve not seen that level of disproportionate spending from just a handful of wealthy billionaires. AMY GOODMAN: So, Brendan Fischer, if you can talk about Elon Musk’s power right now, spent more than — right? — $277 million on getting Trump elected, through super PACs, and where he stands right now? BRENDAN FISCHER: Right. Well, I think Rob Weissman described it very well. You know, Musk has this semi-formal position in the U.S. government. He has already used his formal and informal power to derail a bipartisan spending deal at the end of last year. His personal wealth has ballooned by over $170 billion in just the month following the election, you know, with investors taking the view that his companies are going to do very well under a Trump administration, given that Musk has so much influence over that Trump administration. He’s likely to continue to receive federal contracts, perhaps receive even more federal contracts. Musk’s companies that are heavily regulated or under criminal investigation are likely to receive a light touch under the Trump administration. And his power is now even going global. You know, Musk has begun to meddle in European political affairs, and global leaders are taking that meddling seriously because of the perception or the reality that Musk has influence over the new president. So, I think many global leaders are looking at statements from Musk and wondering whether it’s actually a statement from Trump, or whether a Musk statement about global affairs is going to be adopted by the incoming Trump administration. And again, this is a power that is attributable to Musk’s ability to pour over a quarter-billion dollars into the 2024 election, which is a direct result of the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Brendan, you noted that former President Biden used his farewell address to warn the country of the move, a greater — of the country veering toward an oligarchy. Yet, what did Biden do during his presidency to restrain the influence of money in politics? BRENDAN FISCHER: Not much. Biden’s statement about the power of the growing oligarchy and the growing tech oligarchy were certainly welcome, and they were accurate, but Biden himself did very little during his administration to limit money’s influence on politics. There were no executive orders to crack down on dark money or require contractors to disclose their political spending. And one of the most effective or direct things that a president can do to limit money’s influence on politics or to enforce the laws limiting money’s influence on politics is to appoint commissioners to the Federal Election Commission. And the one Democrat that Biden nominated to the Federal Election Commission actually sided with the Republicans in this key advisory opinion that came out last year that allowed super PACs to coordinate with campaigns on certain canvassing and other activities. And it’s that advisory opinion that allowed Elon Musk’s super PAC to take over some central campaign operations from the Trump campaign. It allowed the Trump campaign to outsource key campaign operations to this Musk-funded super PAC, which further amplified Musk’s political influence. So, Biden’s legacy, in many ways, on money in politics is one of deregulation. You know, it’s on his watch that the FEC has really accelerated this deregulatory turn and has allowed even more money and even more unregulated money to flow into the U.S. political system.
Parallels between European fascism in the 1930s and Trump’s MAGA vision were on full display this week. Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47 th president of the United States put on display fascism’s 21 st -century iteration — a combination of oligarchic power and ultranationalism unlike anything in recent memory. It was a shameful spectacle for a country that deems itself to be the world’s greatest democracy and the leader of the so-called free world. Trump was flanked by billionaire tech moguls and far right leaders from Italy, Germany, Argentina, France, the U.K., and other countries around the globe. His inauguration speech promised a “golden age of America” by making the country “greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.” It was an inauguration speech dripping with authoritarianism and jingoism in which Trump cast himself as the savior of the country. “Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced,” he said, and described the leadership of the past four years as incompetent and corrupt, without specifying Joe Biden or other Democrats by name. The speech left little doubt about its ideological character. Indeed, the political message behind Trump’s return to the White House was best captured by Elon Musk’s Nazi-like salute during the inauguration celebrations (though, in this case, predictably , the Anti-Defamation League rushed immediately to Musk’s defense by downplaying the significance of the gesture). The South African billionaire has appointed himself as leader of the West’s far right movement and has been fomenting fascism since he helped Trump win reelection. For Musk and his ilk, who expect to be the biggest beneficiaries of the new administration’s much anticipated anti-regulation blitz , Trump’s return to office promises a new “ Golden Age ” of U.S. world dominance and prosperity for the super-rich. Acting like an authoritarian from day one, Trump signed dozens of executive orders that pose a direct threat to democracy and make a mockery of human rights and the rule of law. He ordered a crackdown on immigration, withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement and the World Health Organization, and pardoned about 1,500 of his supporters who attacked the U.S. Capitol four years ago. He signed executive orders that seek to end birthright citizenship , which the U.S. Constitution has guaranteed for more than 150 years; terminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion guidelines; and roll back protections for transgender people. Trump also signed an executive order that aims to weaken federal employee protections by reinstituting Schedule F in the excepted service, which Biden had rescinded when he took office. This move is intended to help Trump replace federal employees with loyalists faithful to his agenda. The architects of Project 2025 advocated the revival of Schedule F as part of their aim to “ bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will .” And Trump announced that he will fire over 1,000 appointees from the Biden administration. History never repeats itself exactly, but there are deeply troubling ideological and political parallels between European fascism in the 1930s and Trump’s MAGA vision. To start with, ultranationalism is a key foundation of fascism. Mussolini came to power with a promise to make a “ clean sweep ” of Italy and to restore Rome to its “golden age.” (Hitler had a similar vision for Germany, and a major difference between Italian fascism and Nazism is that the former did not prioritize biological determinism.) Under Trump and his MAGA movement, ultranationalism has been given a new lease on life as the U.S. has had a long-standing tradition in ethnic nationalism and extreme chauvinism. The Alien and Sedition Acts , four internal security laws passed by the U.S. Congress in 1798 during the administration of President John Adams, called for the deportation of people from “hostile” nations and made it a crime to criticize the government. The slogan “America First,” fused with the idea of “ 100 percent Americanism, ” was dominant between the World Wars. And as Adam Smith, director of the Rothermere American Institute at Oxford University, said, in “1930s America, fascism was on the march. ” Trump’s second term promises to turn ultranationalism into state ideology — and the blizzard of executive orders that took place on his first day in office signify in no uncertain terms that his administration will make good on its campaign vow to get rid of “ the enemy from within ” by any means necessary. If the latter materializes, the fusion between ultranationalism and the authoritarian state will produce a full-fledged neofascist government cohabiting with violent neoliberalism as the economic regime. And it will materialize, starting with the sweeping action on immigration and border control, which will enable Trump to carry out his monstrous deportation plan. Having echoed Nazi language by dehumanizing immigrants of color as “animals” and “ poisoning the blood” of the nation, Trump is bent on executing the most massive deportation in U.S. history. This plan isn’t merely a “ disgrace ,” as Pope Francis labelled it, but the apotheosis of cruelty. In his last major essay, “Nine Theses on the Philosophy of History,” Marxist philosopher and critic Walter Benjamin describes in the ninth thesis Paul Klee’s painting named “Angelus Novus,” which Benjamin had purchased in the spring of 1921, as the Angel of History. He writes: A Klee painting named Angelus Novus shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. … This is how one pictures the angel of history must look. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. That which we call progress, is this storm. Klee’s “Angelus Novus” is used by Benjamin, who at the time was fleeing from the gestapo, as a metaphor for the illusion behind the capitalist idea of progress. In the end, like this notion of progress, Trump’s pursuit of a “Golden Age” can only lead to disaster and ruin, to catastrophe for the U.S. and the rest of the world.
Our resistance to fascistic policies must be grounded in our sense of justice, rather than arguments about what’s legal. It’s easy to feel discouraged in these times. The early days of the second Trump administration have been grim and destabilizing. In a flurry of day one executive orders, Trump’s edicts included momentous attacks on trans rights, an unconstitutional effort to end birthright citizenship, and policy changes that will imperil the natural world. One of Trump’s executive orders signaled the United States’ withdrawal from the World Health Organization, jeopardizing national and global responses to future pandemics. Trump’s pardon of January 6 rioters sent a clear message to would-be MAGA vigilantes around the country that those who commit violence on behalf of his movement will have the support of the president. Meanwhile, migrants along the southern border wept as the CBP One app, which allows migrants to apply for legal entry to the U.S. as asylum seekers, was cut off. At Trump’s inauguration rally, Elon Musk raised his right hand from his chest and extended his arm in an upward, diagonal motion, an action that many observers — including this writer and multiple historians — interpreted as a Sieg Heil salute. The Anti-Defamation League and some legacy publications normalized Musk’s action as an “awkward” gesture. The widespread insistence that the gesture must have been something other than a Nazi salute brings to mind George Orwell’s famous words from 1984 : “The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.” The brazenness and severity of Trump’s fascist politics, and those of his merry band of oligarchs, will continue in the coming days. It is a circus of horrors performed by brutish clowns, attempting to act out their bigoted, greed-fueled fantasies. They want people of conscience to feel overwhelmed by despair and disorientation, as though all is lost. They want us to surrender in the face of their extremity and furious momentum. If legal organizations manage to beat back some of the administration’s blatantly illegal maneuvers, such as their attempt to end birthright citizenship, they’re hoping you will thank your lucky stars and leave it at that — assuming that an occasional legal victory is the best we can do. It is not. Trump and his team of oligarchs, including techno-fascists like Musk, want us to believe that the enactment of their political vision is inevitable, and they will exploit your sense of inevitability above all else. In these daunting hours, we must refuse to surrender to the right’s edicts about who can and cannot be saved or who should or should not be helped. We must resist these ideas with our words, our actions, and our moral and political commitments. Feelings of fear and powerlessness are understandable, but if we surrender to fascism in our own minds, our feelings of helplessness will become self-fulfilling as Trump’s violence continues. In moments like this one, it’s easy to become fixated on Trump’s every antic and utterance. After all, when one is watching a disaster unfold, the impulse to check for constant updates is a natural one. Many of us fell into this pattern during the recent wildfires in LA, scrolling relentlessly, looking for any new bit of information about just how bad a horrible situation had gotten. We do this out of worry and fear. We do it because we care, and we don’t know what else to do. When the fires were raging, and I found myself scrolling into the night, I took a moment to ask myself what I could actually do to help. I then interrupted my time off to craft a list of resources for people affected by the fires and those who wanted to donate. I tapped into my relationships to find resources that were recommended by trusted organizers in LA, including a link to a spreadsheet that local organizers were updating in real-time. Once I had shared my list with my friends, social media followers, and newsletter subscribers, I found it easier to step away from the barrage of bad news. I was able to close my eyes and get some rest because I knew that, for the moment, I had done what I could. Sometimes, “bearing witness” feels like the only thing we can do, but the relentless consumption of suffering and injustice does not change anyone’s material conditions. It may feel like we’re doing something, but during such moments, we are experiencing an impact rather than having one. Contributing to the reactive noise of emotional responses likewise has little effect on the tangible outcomes people are experiencing and can, at times, be harmful. In our current moment, it’s important to remind ourselves that we are not helping or saving anyone by falling into patterns of shock and reaction. Absorbing each blow head-on and then performing our disapproval online is not “resistance,” which is something we all should have learned during Trump’s first term. Trump is a performer. Becoming a full-time viewer and critic of the Trump Show does not create safety or justice for anyone. It merely drives us mad. Many have described Trump’s repeated policy blows as a “shock and awe” strategy. While the description is apt, it’s important to remember the objective of shock and awe attacks: to overwhelm a target, distort their perception of the battlefield, and destroy their will to fight. When your enemy wants you disoriented, your ability to focus is an important means of self-defense. What matters to you in this moment? Most of us can meaningfully dedicate ourselves to one or two causes, at the most. What can you commit to doing something about? Where do you get trustworthy information about those subjects? Who do you connect with when deciding what to do about what you’ve learned? Is there an organization whose resources you will employ or whose calls to action you will answer? Do you have a friend group or solidarity network that will formulate a response together? Answering these questions is key to steadying yourself in these times. Remember: Vulnerable people don’t need a sea of reactivity right now. They need caring groups of people who are working together to create as much safety as they can. We need to create a rebellious culture of care. That will take focus and intention. It will take relationships and a whole lot of energy. We cannot afford to burn ourselves out in a state of panic and emotional upheaval. One of the issues that is front and center for me right now is the safety and survival of trans people. On Tuesday, I spoke with Chase Strangio, the first openly trans attorney to argue before the Supreme Court. Strangio emphasized the severity of our situation. “After a campaign that used the demonization of transgender people as a central theme, President Trump wasted no time targeting transgender people in a range of day one executive orders,” Strangio said. “In addition to rescinding protections for transgender people, Trump directed agencies across the government to discriminate against transgender people.” In an executive order titled “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism And Restoring Biological Truth To The Federal Government,” Trump declared that “it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.” This order, which will face numerous legal challenges, will make it more difficult for trans people to acquire federal identification, such as passports, that match their gender identity. The order will also impact incarcerated trans people, who Trump has declared will be housed according to the sex they were assigned at birth. “The expansive sex discrimination order will result in the denial of medical care to transgender people in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, the denial of accurate identification for transgender people from the Department of State, Homeland Security and in personnel records, and the potential exclusion of transgender people from sex-separated spaces in federal buildings,” Strangio explained. “Yesterday’s actions both broadly situate transgender people as an inherent threat to others while exposing transgender people to serious and imminent harms.” Obviously, these policies must be denounced and legal challenges to this executive order should be supported, but such actions are not enough. To support trans safety and survival, we must support trans-led organizing, like the youth-led effort Trans Justice Futures . We must also be willing to defend trans people against the hateful attacks Trump’s anti-trans policies will fuel. Community defense efforts, including bystander intervention training, will be crucial in the weeks and years ahead. Maintaining policies that recognize trans identity in commercial and community spaces, rather than capitulating to right-wing norms, will also be important. Some of us must also be willing to break the law when necessary to help trans people access care, safety, and shelter. In some cases, trans people will need support as they flee areas that are increasingly unsafe for gender-expansive people. Some communities are already creating networks to support people displaced by bigotry and unjust laws. We will need more of those efforts as marginalized people attempt to escape dangerous conditions. Another issue I am deeply concerned about right now is the safety of immigrant communities. On Tuesday, I spoke with Detention Watch Network executive director Silky Shah, who stressed the peril that immigrant communities are facing. “With the first slew of executive orders and the passage of the Laken Riley Act in the Senate on Monday, the Trump administration and members of Congress, including Democrats, have unequivocally made immigrants and immigrant communities a target,” Shah said. The Laken Riley Act would require the Department of Homeland Security to detain undocumented immigrants who are arrested and charged with crimes in the U.S. — including low-level, nonviolent offenses. The deportation of immigrants detained under the Laken Riley Act would be expedited, even before they are convicted. The law would effectively empower police to sentence undocumented immigrants to deportation by mere accusation. Shah stated that the Democrats’ rightward lurch during the 2024 election cycle “has culminated in the passage of one of the harshest immigration laws in decades and an unprecedented wave of anti-immigrant executive branch policies.” Shah compared the political atmosphere that Republicans and Democrats have cultivated to the “tough on crime” era of the 80s and 90s. “The racist and xenophobic rhetoric of this moment is poised to significantly expand both the immigrant detention system and the federal prison and jail system,” Shah said. The Laken Riley Act would make police major players in Trump’s vision for mass deportations. “Trump’s executive orders will undoubtedly be a boon for local sheriffs, private prison companies, and military contractors alike to the detriment of rural and border communities and their long-term economic health,” Shah said. Shah warned that some elected officials will likely regret embracing this strategy. “Just as some elected leaders have since regretted the mass incarceration and warehousing of the working class, poor and disproportionately Black communities, those who sign on to this agenda will regret scapegoating immigrants as the ‘enemy’ of people in the U.S.,” Shah said. “But it’s not too late for elected leaders to reject the Trump agenda. We don’t have to repeat the mistakes of the past.” Another troubling aspect of Laken Riley Act is that it would allow the administration to rely on the norms of criminalization to invisibilize the harms the federal government is committing against immigrants. People in the United States are already conditioned to ignore police brutality and torturous prison conditions. Criminalized people are often written off as deserving of whatever harm they experience. These tendencies will surely be exploited by officials who plan to use the earliest stages of criminalization as a means to expel undocumented people. While the situation is daunting, Shah urges the public to rally together in support of immigrants. “We know that there is power in community,” she said. “Across the country, ordinary people have resisted the expansion of detention to prevent deportations, uniting for their immigrant neighbors and friends. Now is the time to build up community networks of defense and prepare to block new detention centers.” If you want to organize to support and defend immigrant communities, Detention Watch Network’s website can help you connect with one of their member groups . Even if you are engaged in autonomous group organizing, such as a neighbor-based community defense effort, relationships with experienced, trusted groups can be essential. I live in Chicago, where fears are running high about Trump’s plans to attack our immigrant communities. The climate of terror people are experiencing can sometimes lead to false alarms about the presence of ICE agents, which can cause unnecessary panic. If you hear a rumor about the presence of Homeland Security, or you believe you may have witnessed a raid, the best move is to call a hotline operated by a group with experience vetting such reports. In my community, that group is Organized Communities Against Deportations , and their hotline number is 1-855-435-7693. Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker drew praise this week for declaring that the state of Illinois would not cooperate with Trump’s effort to eliminate birthright citizenship. “That’s unconstitutional,” Pritzker declared. “We will not follow an unconstitutional order.” While such acts of refusal by public officials will be essential in the coming years, I noticed another act of refusal on Monday that I think may prove more instructive for everyday people. Firestorm Books, a bookstore co-op and social movement space in Asheville, North Carolina, released a “Statement of Noncooperation” on Monday. In an Instagram post , Firestorm wrote: Our bookstore is no stranger to unwanted government attention; we’ve been threatened by city officials, visited by the FBI, and surveilled by police. Historically, the investigation and prosecution of activists has aimed to disrupt our movements for change, sow fear and isolation among participants, break intergenerational bonds, and criminalize struggles for freedom. But we can overcome these attacks through principled action and uncompromising solidarity. The post went on to outline commitments that the co-op was making, such as minimizing the “non-required collection and storage of information about customers, authors, event participants, and others who engage with our co-op,” refusing to talk to law enforcement, and supporting community members who face repression, “regardless of ‘guilt’ or ‘innocence.’” While the statement may prove reassuring to customers and people who attend events at Firestorm, the bookstore’s commitments are also valuable on a cultural level. The fact that a bookstore would publicly make these commitments highlights the fact that it is up to everyday people ƒ and not simply politicians like Pritzker — to make choices that will protect our communities. While Pritzker’s argument is grounded in the fact that Trump’s attack on birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, Firestorm’s position privileges justice above the law. For everyday people resisting fascistic policies — such as state control of people’s bodies and the state-sanctioned disposal of human beings — defiance must be grounded in our sense of justice, rather than arguments about what’s legal. This is a crucial point, as we all know, wickedness and inhumanity have often been legitimized by legislators and the courts. Firestorm’s statement should be studied by people of conscience, all of whom should devise their own set of commitments. In our organizations, our workplaces, our churches, and our own homes, we must grapple with what it means to refuse to cooperate with injustice. To enact Trump’s fascist vision, the administration will need public cooperation. Doctors, nurses, social workers, clerical workers, teachers, and other everyday people will be expected to submit to fascist norms and participate in acts of criminalization. We will be expected to report people, check boxes, and cooperate with authorities. We will be expected to passively observe acts of violence, as though we are helpless and can organize no intervention. We should all be asking ourselves what rules and laws we are willing to break. What lines are we willing to cross? What are we unwilling to passively accept? To create as much justice and safety as possible, we have to defy authority and disobey. Witnessing and disapproving will not save us. We must be willing to act and refuse to act on the basis of what we know is right. We must build a rebellious culture of care in defiance of a death-making culture of greed. We must reject the disposal of our fellow human beings. Rather than allowing this fascist oligarchy to invisibilize its violence by cloaking its harms in criminalization, we must be willing to become criminals. To be orderly and cooperative in a fascist state is not a virtue. We must be prepared to live and act defiantly, deriving no legitimacy from the illegitimate brutes who would govern us.
Complaints allege that the budget-slashing initiative fails to adhere to regulations for federal advisory committees. The public interest law firm National Security Counselors says it will file a lawsuit in federal court challenging the “Department of Government Efficiency,” a nongovernmental entity spearheaded by President-elect Donald Trump to help advise on cuts to government spending and regulation, within minutes of Trump’s swearing in, according to The Washington Post. The complaint alleges that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) meets the requirements to be considered a “federal advisory committee” — groups that are known as FACAs — and therefore must follow regulations outlined in a 1972 law governing how FACAs operate. FACAs must, for example, file a charter with Congress, keep regular minutes of meetings, and ensure meetings are open to the public. DOGE doesn’t appear to have taken those steps, according to the Post. The watchdog group Public Citizen has also criticized DOGE for failing to adhere to FACA requirements, which stipulate that “membership of the advisory committee be fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee.” To help remedy this, the co-presidents of Public Citizen — Lisa Gilbert and Robert Weissman — last week requested that the Trump transition team co-chairs appoint them to serve on DOGE. “As things stand, DOGE’s membership falls far short of satisfying FACA’s fair-balance requirement,” the two wrote. They also point out that the duo tapped to lead DOGE, billionaire and GOP megadonor Elon Musk and tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, both stand to potentially benefit financially from lessened federal regulation. CBS News reported Sunday that Ramaswamy is expected to depart DOGE and announce a bid for Ohio governor. Scoop — Elon Musk’s DOGE will be sued minutes after Trump’s inauguration today Lawsuit by @NatlSecCnslrs will say DOGE meets conditions for gov advisory counsel requiring balanced representation, open meetings, recorded minutes & more Kel McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors who authored the lawsuit, told the Post that “we’re not trying to say DOGE can’t exist. Advisory committees like DOGE have been around for decades. We’re just saying that DOGE can’t exist without following the law.” Another source the Post spoke with, Sam Hammond of the Foundation for American Innovation — who has been a fan of DOGE’s efforts — told the paper that until Trump actually treats DOGE as a FACA, it doesn’t need to follow FACA reporting rules. “DOGE isn’t a federal advisory committee because DOGE doesn’t really exist. DOGE is a branding exercise, a shorthand for Trump’s government reform efforts,” he said. But early January reporting from the Post indicates that DOGE is more than just a branding exercise. Citing anonymous sources, the outlet reported that aides with DOGE have spoken to staffers at more than a dozen federal agencies to “begin preliminary interviews that will shape the tech executives’ enormous ambitions to tame Washington’s sprawling bureaucracy.” There has also been a hiring sprint. DOGE is aiming to have nearly 100 staff in place by Trump’s inauguration, according to the paper.
Musk weaponized fears of gender-based violence to foster racism in the UK. Will he use the same playbook in the US? With an estimated fortune of nearly $428 billion , the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is rapidly repositioning himself as political pundit-in-chief. At first glance, Musk’s affinity for meddling in political affairs seems like a hobby. He has inserted himself in politics in Europe, having previously endorsed the far right Alternative für Deutschland party before February’s elections. But in the U.K., Musk seems to be eyeing a more dominant role — one that seeks to oust the center left-leaning prime minister, and insert a more radical, right-wing replacement. Beyond sporadic social media posts demanding the release of a far right activist currently in prison, Musk has continually escalated his interventions in recent months. “America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government” he posted in a poll to his 212 million followers on X on January 6. Fifty-eight percent of respondents agreed with his statement. Since 2025 began, Musk has posted about the U.K. almost daily — sometimes, analysis from the Financial Times indicates, dozens of times a day. Musk’s question is merely one in a series of attacks leveled at Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other senior politicians in Britain. Even loyal allies — including hard right politician Nigel Farage, who has previously described Musk as his “hero” — haven’t been spared. Writing on X, Musk claimed Farage “doesn’t have what it takes” to lead Reform UK, a right-wing populist political party that claimed 14 percent of the vote in 2024’s election. And Musk’s backing comes with capital, with some reports indicating Musk has considered donating $100 million to the party. Farage is already a beneficiary of Musk’s policies: He’s one of three Reform MPs who earn thousands of pounds through his posts on X, which often include hateful rhetoric, via the company’s “creator revenue” program. On January 7, Musk accused Jess Phillips, the current U.K. minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, who has been a long-standing campaigner against gender-based violence, of being a “rape genocide apologist.” Starmer, Musk claimed, was “deeply complicit in the mass rapes in exchange for votes.” These remarks have brought the so-called “ grooming gangs scandal ” back into the political spotlight. The scandal refers to organized networks of men who are allegedly responsible for long-running sexual exploitation and abuse of vulnerable girls and women in the U.K., and the far right has saturated the narrative with anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiments. In a review into grooming gangs in Rotherham, a professor concluded that the majority of “known perpetrators were of Pakistani heritage.” Similarly, an independent inquiry into abuse in Telford, found that the men convicted were of “Southern Asian heritage.” Some ministers have aggressively publicized these studies, while some other reports — including the convictions of a group of white men and women for abusing 30 children in the town of Cornwall in 2010 — have been deliberately overlooked. It should go without saying that exploitation and abuse aren’t confined to any one racial or ethnic group, but the racist narratives surrounding the abuse in Oldham have been so intense that the National Police Chiefs’ Council found it necessary to specifically clarify to the public that in 2024, the vast majority of group-based child abuse cases in the U.K. (85 percent) were committed by white people, not Pakistani people, in keeping with the U.K.’s white-dominated demographics. Musk’s accusation came soon after Phillips declined to order a national inquiry into “grooming gangs” in the town of Oldham. Phillips claims that investigations on this subject are in the remit of the local council, pointing to previous local, independent inquiries covering towns including Telford, Rochdale and Rotherham. Musk, on the other hand, claims she “should be in prison.” After Musk’s badgering, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper signaled a shift in the national government’s position on January 16, announcing five government-backed local inquiries and a nationwide review of grooming gang evidence, including key demographics. Advocates of Musk’s approach argue his messages tap into underlying frustrations the British public has with the state of the country and its leadership. Evidence, however, suggests otherwise. According to polling from Opinium, the majority of Britons — 53 percent — believe Musk is having a negative effect on British politics. But Musk’s role in shaping the political debate in Britain is already palpable — instead of discussing the flailing National Health Service, Starmer found himself called upon to deny Musk’s allegations that he concealed child abuse and exploitation and didn’t take sufficient action when he led the Crown Prosecution Service, the independent body prosecuting criminal cases in England and Wales, between 2008 and 2013, when the scandal emerged. Musk’s interference in British politics is spreading dangerous misinformation. The picture of the scandal has been simplified to suit Musk’s narrative. In reality, while the Crown Prosecution Service was criticized for deeming a victim of abuse “unreliable,” the decision not to proceed with prosecution was overturned under Starmer’s leadership. A government-commissioned inquiry into the grooming scandal took place in 2014, with an additional review taking place in 2022. The inquiry — which found that authorities’ response was characterised by delays and that some choices were shaped by a fear of being perceived as racist — led to some resignations and apologies. Now, the Labour Party argues the focus should be on acting on the review’s recommendations. What lies beneath the surface of this right-wing rhetoric, then, is more a desire to use victims’ suffering for political point-scoring than it is a genuine interest in tackling gender-based violence. Musk’s interest in British politics is notably narrow — he has taken intense interest only in sexual abuse cases where perpetrators were of Asian descent. Meanwhile, he enabled a proliferation of rumors grounded in anti-immigrant sentiment on X about the identity of the murderer of three young girls at a dance class in Southport which sparked national riots, but notably failed to condemn the far right violence that followed. And, perhaps most significantly, he has pretended to champion women’s rights while supporting — and soon working under — Donald Trump, who was found liable for sexual assault in 2023. On one level, Musk’s involvement in U.K. politics appears motivated by his vendetta against the Labour Party itself, which he has harbored at least since the party came to power in 2024. In the early weeks of Starmer’s premiership, Musk dashed Labour’s hopes of attracting business investment, claiming that “very few” companies will be willing to invest in the U.K. with the current administration. With his frequent proclamations of frustration with the current government, Musk is animating the public against Labour — and leaving the door open for the installation of a more extreme, right-wing leader, like Farage, who could be seen as a counterpart to Musk’s ally in Trump. But on a larger scale, Musk’s intervention in U.K. politics reflects his broader orientation toward global politics: stoking far right extremist outsiders and seeking to strengthen their hand against more moderate politicians. Among both more established and emerging far right leaders, Musk has positioned himself as a critical ally. Even after being accused by the German government of meddling in the upcoming elections, Musk is set to host an X Spaces discussion with Alice Weidel, the leader of far right party Alternative für Deutschland. Supporting populist, anti-immigrant politicians beyond elections is central to Musk’s persona too, as he’s spent time cozying up to other right-wing leaders, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Argentinian President Javier Milei. Whether Musk will wade into British politics while he is part of Trump’s administration remains to be seen. But his focus will certainly remain international, not just domestic — the billionaire is already reported to have allegedly held private talks with allies on ousting Starmer before the next election. And after describing civil war in Britain as “inevitable,” it’s too easy to forget that Musk himself is part of a bigger problem. After all, a lust for power that isn’t easily satisfied serves as a prescient warning to the U.S. as to what Musk may have in store.
All three have acted in ways beneficial to Trump — and are likely to financially benefit from Trump’s presidency. The three richest people in the world — billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg — are scheduled to attend president-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Monday, showcasing the oligarchic partnership that the incoming administration will have with them and the corporate elite. The three men will be seated on the platform of the event , next to Trump’s cabinet nominees and other elected officials, and will be very close to Trump himself as he’s sworn in and delivers his inauguration speech, a source with knowledge of the plans indicated. Their inclusion in the event comes as the three billionaires — whose total net worth is valued at $885 billion — have all made recent moves to benefit Trump’s campaign. Musk, owner of the social media site X and the space venture company SpaceX, spent around a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump get elected president, and campaigned with him during the election season. He will also be part of a so-called “Department of Government Efficiency,” which will be tasked with making steep cuts to government spending — a position he will majorly benefit from, given the many federal contracts his companies receive. The department will likely zero-in on cutting social safety net programs , including Social Security. Zuckerberg, who owns Meta, the parent company of social media platforms Facebook and Instagram, has recently loosened content moderation policies on those sites , making them more tolerant of bigoted, far right voices in support of Trump and his MAGA agenda. Zuckerberg has also donated at least $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund — a move he will likely benefit from, as Meta faces a potential Federal Trade Commision (FTC) lawsuit in April amid allegations of acting as a monopoly. It’s possible that Trump could order the FTC to drop the claims. In the final weeks of the presidential campaign, Bezos, who owns The Washington Post , altered the paper’s policy on endorsing presidential candidates , blocking the editorial board from issuing its endorsement of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris as was planned. Bezos, who also owns a space venture company called Blue Origin, is currently competing for huge government contracts to help fund that project. In the past, the three billionaires — particularly Musk — have expressed far right and authoritarian viewpoints. Musk, for example, has expressed support for far right political movements in Europe, and endorsed Alternative for Germany (AfD) in that country’s upcoming elections . AfD is vehemently anti-immigration, and its leaders have repeatedly espoused antisemitism and downplayed the atrocities of the Holocaust. Critics have lambasted both political parties for their promotion of billionaires in the presidential race (Harris had the open backing of multiple billionaires, too, including Mark Cuban), calling it a disturbing trend that allows a few wealthy individuals to have a major hand in the federal government’s decision-making processes. “We’ve come a long way — and, in my view, not in a great direction — towards our elections being celebrations of billionaires, our elections being battlegrounds for billionaires to have their fights, to center their issues,” The Lever’s David Sirota said in a post-election discussion on Democracy Now! in November. “And essentially, what ends up happening is, is that the 2024 election, that was supposed to be about saving democracy, was essentially an exercise in destroying what was left of democracy, turning our elections themselves into an open celebration of the oligarchy.”
Professor Quinn Slobodian discusses Musk’s admiration of authoritarian strongmen, white supremacist rhetoric, and more. Billionaire Trump associate Elon Musk’s latest disinformation campaign is targeting the U.K. government, which Musk appears to believe is not sufficiently anti-immigrant. Musk, who has already shaped the incoming Trump administration’s economic policy by proposing cuts to government spending and tech-oriented privatization of services, signifies a “new era” in American politics, says our guest Quinn Slobodian, who is chronicling right-wing tech billionaires’ accelerating attempts to mold the world according to their “destructive” and “nihilist” beliefs. In a far-reaching conversation, Slobodian touches on Musk’s clear admiration of authoritarian strongmen, market deregulation and white supremacist rhetoric. This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman. Tech billionaire Elon Musk posted a poll early this morning on X asking, quote, “America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government — Yes or No?” The question was part of a series of misinformation-filled posts on Musk’s X social media platform that led The New York Times to report Musk, quote, “appears intent on exercising the same influence in European countries that he did during the American presidential election,” unquote. Over the past few days, Musk lashed out at the U.K.’s Labour government, also trashed a U.K. politician he had formerly backed, the anti-immigrant populist Nigel Farage with the far-right Reform UK party. Musk’s change of heart came after Farage refused to support the release from prison of far-right, anti-immigrant, Islamophobic activist Tommy Robinson. Meanwhile, Musk also falsely accused U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer of failing to prosecute child rapists, and supported a post on X that urged King Charles to dissolve the British Parliament and call elections to remove the Labour government. This comes after Elon Musk also backed Germany’s far-right, anti-immigrant party AfD for next month’s elections and is set to host a live discussion on X with its candidate for chancellor. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz responded to Musk’s endorsements, saying, quote, “I don’t believe in courting Mr. Musk’s favor. I’m happy to leave that to others. The rule is: don’t feed the troll,” he said. Meanwhile, here in the United States, the richest man in the world — that’s Elon Musk — donated more than a quarter of a billion dollars to President-elect Trump’s campaign. He’s now shaping policy for the incoming administration. And it’s believed he’s made, since the election, over $200 billion. Musk attended a New Year’s Eve gala at Mar-a-Lago alongside Trump and has joined him on a number of calls with foreign leaders. Musk will co-head Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Last month, Musk played a key role in pushing Republican lawmakers to kill a short-term government spending deal at the last minute. Musk also got Trump’s support for backing H-1B visas for highly skilled workers despite opposition from Trump’s anti-immigrant base. Meanwhile, on Friday, the Pulitzer Prize-winning political cartoonist Ann Telnaes quit The Washington Post after her editors rejected a cartoon depicting billionaires genuflecting to President-elect Trump. She says it was the first time since she began working at the Post in 2008 she had a cartoon killed because of who or what she chose to aim her pen at. A draft of the cartoon depicts Big Tech owners kneeling at Trump’s feet up sacks of cash, among them Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos. Just two months ago, the Post featured Ann Telnaes in a video celebrating her work. ANN TELNAES: I mean, just look at all the autocrats that hate editorial cartoonists. I mean, not in this country, hopefully, but in — you know, a lot of my colleagues overseas are thrown in jail for doing cartoons about powerful people. … A lot of people don’t realize that, you know, we’re journalists. We’re opinion journalists, but we are journalists. And that is our job as editorial cartoonists: to bring up sometimes uncomfortable truths. AMY GOODMAN: On Friday, Ann Telnaes published an online post titled “Why I’m quitting the Washington Post,” in which she writes, quote, “I will not stop holding truth to power through my cartooning, because as they say, ‘Democracy dies in darkness.’” Of course, she is citing The Washington Post ’s motto. This comes after Jeff Bezos prevented The Washington Post from endorsing Kamala Harris for president and as Amazon’s Prime Video service announced it’s acquired exclusive licensing rights to a new behind-the-scenes documentary about first lady Melania Trump. Amazon also plans to donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund and said it would stream the event on Prime Video as a separate in-kind donation worth another million dollars. For more, we spend the rest of the hour with a person who’s documented the power of Big Tech billionaires and the new techs, specifically, among others, Elon Musk, the richest man in the world. Quinn Slobodian is professor of international history at Boston University. His latest book is Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy . He’s written several pieces for The New Statesman on Elon Musk, including one headlined “Elon Musk’s death drive.” Slobodian also recently contributed to The New York Review of Books running symposium about the reelection of Donald Trump, “The Return of Trump—II.” He’s joining us from Boston, just back from the American Historical Association annual gathering here in New York. Professor Slobodian, welcome to Democracy Now! The power of Elon Musk cannot be underestimated, from here in the United States — and we’re going to talk about the Trump administration — well, many are calling him, of course, “President Musk” and “Vice President Donald Trump” — to, well, the latest kerfuffle in Britain and his support for the AfD in Germany. If you can talk about the significance of all of this? QUINN SLOBODIAN: Yeah, it’s a pretty extraordinary situation to find ourselves in, right? I mean, if you think back to 2017, there was a lot of concern and attention to the efforts of Steve Bannon to create a kind of transatlantic coalition of far-right actors and parties. Imagine now here we are only a few years later, and there’s a Bannon-like figure but who also happens to be the wealthiest man in the world, overseeing some of the most profitable companies in the planet, who is leading that sort of effort to create a transatlantic coalition. So, the stakes are much, much higher. They are being dealt with with perhaps even less kind of care than someone like Bannon, which is an extraordinary thing to say. But Musk, I think, has entered this field of politics as a kind of scaled-up version of his video game play, with no real thought to the kind of consequences of the disruptive effects that he’s creating, from here to Britain to Germany and beyond. AMY GOODMAN: And let’s talk specifically about the conversation we’re having on this day, on January 6th, when the vice president, Kamala Harris, who presides over the Senate, will essentially certify her own loss, and this fourth anniversary of what took place January 6th, 2021. QUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, I think that, you know, the January 6 is apropos for a couple reasons. One is kind of silly but also meaningful, which is, if you look at the character that Musk uses when he plays the game Diablo IV , which he describes as giving him life lessons and allowing him to see the matrix, the guy kind of looks quite a bit like the QAnon shaman, so well known from January 6. So, January 6, in a way, kind of, I think, opened this new era in American politics where the kind of surreal, fringe, often online communities have sort of entered the world of sort of high politics and have scrambled the kind of coordinates of average rules of the game and the normal sort of protocols. I think that Musk is someone who is really a product of that kind of crossover effect, where building up a kind of huge online community, building up the sort of status as a global media influencer, has now the capacity to actually shatter existing coalitions, shatter existing standards of what normal politics is. And his connections now to people like Nigel Farage, until recently, Tommy Robinson, the AfD, Giorgia Meloni, these are signs of kind of a willingness to shatter existing traditional party systems, to embrace disruption kind of for its own sake, and to really harness especially the power of the internet to make possible things that had been previously impossible, so to make certain forms of speech possible, to make certain forms of mobilization possible, and to make things like, you know, the attempted coup d’état in January 6 something that could actually be followed through to its conclusion. And I think that, you know, the kind of — the horizon of what the kind of politics in real life that someone like Musk is aiming at is broadcast by him frequently on his own Twitter account. Most recently, for example, he celebrated Nayib Bukele, the leader in El Salvador, as having done something that has happened in El Salvador and will happen and must happen in the United States, which, in El Salvador, has been to imprison 2% of the adult population as an absolutely draconian way of cracking down on crime. So, this vision of sort of authoritarian strongman on politics, sort of gloves-off mass incarceration crackdowns, on the one hand, and then a deregulatory kind of unleashing of the free market, on the other hand, is — produced this kind of curious combination of, on the one hand, Elon Musk posting Milton Friedman memes all the time, on the other hand, scaremongering about the, quote-unquote, “genocidal rape tactics” of nonwhite immigrants in the U.K. So, he’s produced this sort of surreal effect, I think, of sort of the strong state and the free market turning the sort of Thatcherist vision, grafting it onto all kinds of online aesthetics and kind of video game dynamics in ways that have really, I think, blindsided, for good reason, sort of mainstream, normal politicians, like Olaf Scholz, Keir Starmer, Biden-Harris, who don’t know how to deal with this kind of chaotic energy, which, unfortunately, has a huge amount of legitimacy behind it, not only his multimillion-dollar — or, multimillion number of followers on social media. But keep in mind, I mean, he oversees Tesla, which is a car company that is worth more than all the other car companies in the world combined, whose valuation has gone vertical since Trump’s election, whose stocks are held in the portfolios of many, many, many Democrats who might otherwise find Musk, as a person, and his politics objectionable. So, he is a kind of a locomotive who has sort of attached himself to the very dynamics of both the online sort of meme market, but also the very much offline stock market, in ways that makes him hard to reckon with and hard to actually oppose. AMY GOODMAN: Your most recent piece for The New Statesman is headlined “Elon Musk wants us to have more children: Is demography the new front line of the culture wars?” Explain. QUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, this is really a fixation of Musk that echoes throughout other Silicon Valley thinkers, too, which is a fear that demographic decline is coming more quickly than many of us realize. And that gets read in sort of two ways. On the one hand, as he frequently says, you know, there will be no human civilization if there are no humans. So there’s this kind of universal fear of the reality of sort of long-term slowing birth rates leading to literally fewer humans on Earth. But more importantly for him is particular humans on Earth. So, if you look at the kind of conversations he’s had, especially in Italy with members of the Brothers of Italy, the fascist-derived party from which — you know, which Meloni now heads, the fear is the loss of populations of a discrete culture. So he’s worried about the decline of particular European civilizations, particular European cultures, the Italian culture, the British culture. He has endorsed the “great replacement” theory, this notion that liberal politicians are encouraging immigration from nonwhite populations to build their own support, but also, too, to kind of dilute and disorient the native or autochthonous population. So, his pronatalism is not a kind of a general one that sort of hopes that humans can propagate themselves to produce hopefully more solutions to human problems, but it’s the defense of particular human populations which he sees as endowed with more capacity for kind of economic productivity, economic intelligence and sort of economic performance. So, his immigration policy and his immigration language is now — in the last two weeks has taken a very hard-right turn. Many people have noticed that. In December, you could have seen him still posting about meritocracy and the idea that anyone can make it in the United States if they work hard enough. Since January 1st, almost exactly, the stream of his posts has been dominated by the faces of men who have been charged with sexual crimes, who are from Muslim-majority countries. He is doing everything he can to sort of hype up very clearly racially coded fear of sexual assault and crimes coming from immigrants on non-Western backgrounds, and pairing that with this idea of immigrants from non-Western backgrounds as sort of welfare dependents who are not feeding into the mainstream economy. So, his demographic fears are very much also part of his kind of hard crime, hard borders policy that is now starting to come to the fore as his primary talking point. AMY GOODMAN: Let me ask you something. I’m looking at a piece in the Financial Times . “Elon Musk lived in apartheid South Africa until he was 17. David Sacks, the venture capitalist who has become a fundraiser for Donald Trump and a troll Ukraine, left aged five, and grew up in a South African diaspora family in Tennessee. Peter Thiel spent years of childhood in South Africa and Namibia, where his father was involved in uranium mining as part of the apartheid regime’s clandestine drive to acquire nuclear weapons. And Paul Furber, an obscure South African software developer and tech journalist living near Johannesburg, has been identified by two teams of forensic linguists as the originator of the QAnon conspiracy, which helped shape Trump’s Maga movement. (Furber denies being ‘Q’.) In short, four of Maga’s most influential voices are fiftysomething white men with formative experiences in apartheid South Africa.” Can you comment on this, Professor Slobodian? QUINN SLOBODIAN: Absolutely. This is something I’ve written about in a couple of my books. The centrality of southern Africa for the far right and for neoliberals is quite extraordinary. Rhodesia, of course, has been seen as a kind of a lost cause for the hard right. People might remember Dylann Roof, the far-right mass murderer, talking about his allegiance to the Rhodesian cause. South Africa, in the time of apartheid, was seen as a kind of a last bulwark against the Black socialism of postcolonial Africa. In the time of transition, in the time of Mandela, in the move to “one person, one vote” universal suffrage, in the end of apartheid, it was cast by the far right and by sort of libertarians and neoliberals as a kind of prosperous site of gold production and manufacturing that was now under assault by a socialist, Black-majority government, the ANC. And for Musk himself, the experience of growing up there with a very authoritarian, dictatorial father was a very dystopian one, from the way that his biographer recounts it. There’s memories that he recounts, perhaps a little bit gleefully, and perhaps through fabrication, of sort of walking through puddles of blood on the way to rock concerts. He saw it as a kind of a social Darwinist, sort of all-against-all-type environment, which I think has now very much implanted into his mind. I think he discovers that again in the online world of brutal, so-called dungeon-crawling video games, where he spends much of his time, and also in the kind of cyberpunk world of science fiction and films and novels. So, I think that extrapolation, which is in part based on the reality of very intense intercommunal conflict, but also becomes something that he can kind of embrace to kind of give — to permit his own sort of vision of nihilism, really, and this belief that all alliances are kind of provisional, you need to defend your own. As we know, he’s sort of been clear about sort of building compounds to which he can retreat, expanding his own genetic pool through, you know, a very large family, using the federal government when it’s useful, you know, tapping into federal budgets, becoming effectively a techno contractor for NASA through SpaceX, selling his services as Starlink, but always, I think, very much with this exit end game in mind, the same way that many people in South Africa have their own kind of gated communities into which they can withdraw, if they can afford it, with their own water systems and their own sort of power supplies. This kind of Octavia Butler Parable of the Sower -type reality is one that someone like Musk has sort of sadistically embraced in a way. And I think that his sort of accelerationism, by which he makes alliances recklessly, one after the other, with whichever kind of far-right politician appears on his video feed and has a kind of a distinctive appearance — you know, Tommy Robinson does look like he might have stepped out of a video game. Naomi Seibt, the Alternative for Germany influencer, who he has done so much to boost, sort of cultivates this sort of anime-like appearance. So, I think that, for Musk and Thiel and others, the experience of apartheid and post-apartheid South Africa has, for them, filled this role of a kind of a bad future, which is also inevitable and from which they have to just do everything they can to kind of, you know, hunker down and shield themselves, while also tapping into, of course, the extraordinary profits that are available in doing things like providing surveillance systems, as Palantir does, Thiel’s company; providing weapon systems, as Anduril does, the Palmer Luckey-owned company that Thiel helped back; and the various other ways that the old-fashioned military-industrial complex, I think, is now just being extended with a new kind of Silicon Valley kind of headquarters. AMY GOODMAN: And then you have Elon Musk changing his symbol on X — and if you can explain — with Pepe the Frog, which was appropriated by right-wing groups, classified as a hate symbol by anti-hate groups due to its frequent use in racist and antisemitic contexts. The term “kek,” a variation of ”LOL,” originated in the online gaming world, frequently used by identitarian right internet users and trolls, BBC reporting Southern Poverty Law Center linked “kek” to a “virtual white nationalist god”? What is going on here? QUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, this part of it is very much a kind of a replay of the 2016-17 kind of moment, right? I mean, we all remember when people like Richard Spencer were getting a lot of attention for propagating these memes of Pepe the Frog, using the emoji of a glass of milk to signify whiteness. And so, there is this kind of a very adolescent and juvenile level of kind of provocation, that is well characterized, I think, by Olaf Scholz as trollishness, that Musk, again, in his somehow middle-aged, you know, third or fourth adolescence, still manages to kind of embrace and take a kind of childlike pleasure in. And I think it’s actually probably not a good idea to focus too much on, you know, the number of Pepe the Frog memes that he has posted or whatever. I think these are, more or less, surface froth and distraction from the more serious interventions. I think that — AMY GOODMAN: So, let’s talk about — QUINN SLOBODIAN: — Alternative for Germany is — AMY GOODMAN: — those serious interventions, and specifically as we move — QUINN SLOBODIAN: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: — into the second Trump presidency with Elon Musk — QUINN SLOBODIAN: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: — wielding so much power. What do you expect to see from Trump II? QUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, as far as Musk’s role in it, I mean, he himself has been openly inspired by not just Bukele, as I mentioned, but also, looking further southward, Javier Milei in Argentina, you know, frequently endorsed him. Trump also has met Milei. And there’s a kind of sense that Milei has, for someone like Musk, sort of given us an example in advance of how you can realize your kind of technolibertarian vision through authoritarian statist means, which seems paradoxical but actually perhaps isn’t. So, if you look at what Milei has done, I think it could help us to sort of understand what Musk might be proposing, at least, and that Trump might help carry out. So, what kind of things have taken the brunt under Milei? Well, it’s been things like universities, the freezing of the inflation increases for university funding, the freezing of other forms of scientific research, the freezing of the right to protest and collectively bargain, the elimination of cultural programs, the crackdown on other forms of public expression. And these are, I think, you know, previews of the things that in the sort of solutionist mindset, the engineering mindset of someone like Musk, all forms of endeavor that aren’t aimed at cracking this one central wicked problem, whether it’s space travel or the expansion of the military budget, are forms of waste. So I think that we’ll see a kind of a redirection of funding, obviously, towards hard research and the slashing of funding to things seen as superficial — forms of entitlement, forms of education and research. Those, I think, are the things that probably an austerity-minded Democrat could advocate as much as an austerity-minded Republican, and it’s probably where they’ll be able to create kind of alliances. I think that the attack on free speech in the course of the protests over Gaza since October 6th have given us a kind of a preview of how unwilling Democrats, as well as Republicans, are to actually stand up for the right of academic investigation and expression in this country, and I think that universities will really be the kind of soft targets for many of those early cuts. AMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you so much for being with us, Quinn Slobodian, professor of international history at Boston University. His latest book is Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy . We’ll link to your articles on Musk for The New Statesman . That does it for our show. We want to thank everyone for helping to make this broadcast possible.
The circle of billionaires in Trump’s cabinet embodies the reign of American oligarchy. In the narrative of mainstream U.S. media, oligarchs — super-rich, politically connected individuals with influence over the state — exist only in post-communist countries and post-colonial societies in Latin America, Asia and Africa. Their power is seen as a foreign, un-American deviation from capitalism. In reality, however, the United States’ own oligarchs are thriving. The U.S., despite the continued reverie expressed for democratic ideals, has shown to be a full-fledged plutocratic oligarchy — and for the next four years, it will be run directly by the oligarchs themselves. President-elect Donald Trump has assembled an administration of billionaires and warmongers whose combined wealth runs into hundreds of billions of dollars. In a way, there is nothing surprising about this disturbing development. The rich in the U.S. have seen their wealth rise dramatically over the past 30 years, and the last four years have been particularly great for billionaires. Most people in the U.S. think that the economy works only for the rich and the powerful . Of course, money in the U.S. has always been “ the measure of everything ,” and the country’s politics and economy have always been dominated by a wealthy few. The founders of this country were not only white but also rich men who had a very restricted notion of freedom and equality; most of them were also enslavers. Thomas Jefferson, a principal author of the Declaration of Independence and third president of the United States, enslaved more than 600 people. White property owners were the only group of people allowed to vote in the first presidential election . By the 19th century, robber barons and captains of industry of the Gilded Age held enormous political influence, which came about as a result of the vast wealth they had accumulated by using unethical tactics to dominate industries and ruthless methods to exploit workers. The likes of Cornelius Vanderbilt, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan ruled the country — Morgan even bailed out the U.S. government twice during his lifetime. How did Morgan get so rich and powerful in the first place? He did so mainly through the founding of private banks and industrial consolidation, i.e. by combining small companies into one big corporation and thus creating monopolies. Morgan hated competition and believed that U.S. capitalism should be under the control of financial wizards like himself. He made a huge fortune on railroads and in steel. He rescued the U.S. Treasury in 1895 following the Panic of 1893 by selling a portion of his companies’ own gold reserves to the government in exchange for a 30-year bond. In doing so, he made of course a lot of extra money in the process. And averted the collapse of the financial system during the Panic of 1907 , which disrupted the entire economy, by arranging the bailout of several large New York banks as the Federal Reserve did not exist and thus there was no lender of last resort. Morgan saved the country twice, and many Americans saw him as a true patriot. But, as historian Richard A. Naclerio has written, “to those who rigidly examined his actions, he was a monster who fed off the demise of economic destruction.” The presence of a plutocratic oligarchy in U.S. society is not an aberration. It has always existed and will exist as long as capitalism does. It cannot be solved within the existing state of socioeconomic affairs. What is unique with Trump’s team of billionaires is that, if all are confirmed, will make his administration the wealthiest in U.S. history. And then there is Elon Musk. A proto-fascist tech oligarch, the world’s richest person spent “ at least $260 million ” helping Trump get reelected and find his way into Trump’s inner circle. He now has been tasked with leading — along with Vivek Ramaswamy, another major donor — a newly created “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), an entity that Trump indicated will operate outside the government. In other words, DOGE is not an official federal agency or commission that requires congressional authorization, and its role will be to advise the White House on slashing spending and dismantling the federal bureaucracy. The creation of DOGE is part of the conservative vision for smaller government outlined by Project 2025 . It is expected to focus on rolling back government regulations, cutting entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, targeting the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Education, potentially stripping federal workers of protection by replacing civil servants with political appointees and even eliminating certain parts of the government, with the stated aim to slash at least $2 trillion from the nearly $7 trillion federal annual budget. Musk is particularly hostile to regulation and happens to be involved in several ongoing legal battles with regulatory bodies. One of his companies, SpaceX, has even filed lawsuits seeking to dismantle the National Labor Relations Board. Although it is totally unrealistic to find $2 trillion in federal budget cuts, the plan to drastically cut the federal government can do a lot of damage; many congressional Republicans will take cues from Musk’s plans and even some Democrats are expected to join the DOGE caucus. Limiting the federal government’s power to regulate corporations and protect workers has always been a key goal of conservative political thinking and an endgame of the U.S. oligarchic plutocracy. In fact, there is a precedent for the creation of DOGE. In 1982, Ronald Reagan, who laid the foundations for the neoliberal order, created the President’s Private Sector Survey on Cost Control in the Federal Government (PPSSCC) popularly known as the “Grace Commission” after its chairman J. Peter Grace, CEO of W. R. Grace & Company, a multibillion-dollar global supplier of chemicals. The commission consisted of over 150 business leaders and its primary aim was to reduce the U.S. deficit by identifying potential cuts to be made through executive action or legislation. One of the most alarming recommendations of the Grace Commission was the privatization of public management, especially public power, which conservatives had been fighting against since the 1920s, viewing it as a socialist scheme . Trump brought oligarchy to the White House during his first term by staffing his cabinet with the likes of Secretary of State and former Exxon-Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, an investor known as Wall Street’s “King of Bankruptcy” and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, an investment banker. But the president-elect — who vowed during his campaign to “make America wealthy again” — has outdone himself, selecting a record-breaking number of billionaires for his second administration. As he resumes the presidency, Trump appears hell-bent on reassuring plutocrats that they are in charge of the country and its future. Trump’s second administration will surely renew its aggressive deregulatory efforts — particularly targeting the economy and the environment. Trump is poised to take extreme measures like banning environmental, social and governance investments, extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted in late 2017 and favored corporations and the rich, and shredding social safety net programs. The U.S. is already a plutocracy in all but name — Trump 2.0 wants to proudly declare it so.
The senator weighed in on the right’s infighting, saying the real issue at hand is corporate abuse of workers. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) has flamed Elon Musk and the right over his support of H-1B visas, saying that the program in its current form is another tool for corporations to exploit workers and line billionaires’ pockets with the fruits of the abuse. “Elon Musk is wrong,” Sanders said on social media on Thursday. “The main function of the H-1B visa program is not to hire ‘the best and the brightest,’ but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad.” In recent weeks, Elon Musk has been speaking out vehemently in favor of H-1B visas, non-immigrant visas that allow U.S. companies to hire specialized workers from abroad on a temporary basis. The support for the program by Musk and others like Donald Trump has caused infighting among the right, which has otherwise adopted fascistic, rigid stances against programs of any kind allowing people from foreign countries to enter the country. Progressives have argued that people on both sides of the debate are wrong , with one side making racist, xenophobic arguments and the other making an argument for labor exploitation. Instead, progressives say that the H-1B program, rather than being a pro-immigration program, is designed to allow corporations to pay workers less than the market rate while trapping them in demanding positions where they may be overworked. In a statement, Sanders called out Musk and billionaires for being at the helm of yet another labor exploitation pipeline. He said that, instead, the H-1B program is in need of reforms to ensure fairer pay and treatment for foreign workers. “Elon Musk and a number of other billionaire tech company owners have argued that this federal program is vital to our economy because of the scarcity of highly skilled American engineers and other tech workers. I disagree,” he said. “If there is really a shortage of skilled tech workers in America, why did Tesla lay-off over 7,500 American workers this year — including many software developers and engineers at its factory in Austin, Texas — while being approved to employ thousands of H-1B guest workers” at relatively low wages, Sanders asked. Economists and immigrant advocates have long said that the structure of the H-1B program is a lose-lose for foreign and American workers. As people on work-based visas, foreign workers on H1-Bs are especially vulnerable to employer abuse. At the same time, because it is legal for corporations to underpay workers on H-1Bs, American workers are harmed as the market value of their positions are depressed or corporations lay them off for cost. This practice is particularly prevalent in Big Tech , where research has shown that companies aren’t using the visa program to fill genuine labor needs, but rather to lay off workers in well-compensated positions in favor of cheaper labor. Sanders said that lawmakers must “significantly raise the minimum wage for guest workers” and “allow them to easily switch jobs” under the program. “The widespread corporate abuse of the H-1B program must be ended,” Sanders said. Other progressives have similarly pointed to corporations as the real issue in the H-1B debate, while also advocating for immigration policies based in humane practices, rather than perverse economic incentives. “Since 1978, CEO pay has skyrocketed 1,085 percent,” pointed out progressive advocate and former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner . “Meanwhile, workers on H-1B visas have strict employment rules that limits their ability to leave their employers, which opens them up to exploitation: lower pay and more outrageous productivity goals. This is about corporations squeezing every last penny out of anyone and anything they can.”
The billionaire Musk has downplayed the party’s extremist views in posts on X and in an op-ed in a German newspaper. Mega-billionaire Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, plans to hold an online audio discussion on the platform with the leader of a far right German party, amplifying the party’s fascist and neo-Nazi ideology. The discussion between him and Alice Weidel, a leader for Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the party’s candidate for chancellor in the February 23 snap elections, will take place”very soon,” a spokesperson for Weidel said, indicating that it will “definitely” happen before the elections. The German-based newswire agency dpa reported that the talk between Weidel and Musk would occur on January 10 . Musk signaled his support for AfD in mid-December, writing in a post on X that “only the AfD can save Germany.” He also penned an op-ed in a German newspaper last week , describing the party as the “last spark of hope” for the country. Musk’s announcement that he will engage in a discussion with the party’s leader indicates that he may insert himself further into German politics in the coming weeks — much like he did in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, spending over a quarter of a billion dollars of his own money to help elect Donald Trump . AfD is an extreme right, neo-Nazi organization . The party is vehemently anti-immigration and is particularly bigoted against Muslim migrants. Its leaders have also expressed antisemitic sentiments, and have downplayed the atrocities by Nazi German leaders, going so far as to demand museums and schools change how the Holocaust is taught in schools. Some AfD leaders have minimized or outright denied the Holocaust. Others have attended neo-Nazi events, including two leaders who appeared at a gathering of neo-Nazis in Switzerland just last month . Musk has downplayed the party’s extremist views, claiming in his op-ed that a singular instance of one of the party’s leaders being in a same-sex relationship negated its other actions — a dubious suggestion, given that AfD is also opposed to marriage equality in Germany. Polling indicates that AfD is not currently winning the race in Germany , but is gaining popularity — and other parties may consider forming a coalition with the far right one in order to create a government. Lawmakers, including current Chancellor Olaf Scholz, are encouraging voters to thwart Musk’s endorsements and to vote for their own interests. “Where Germany goes from here will be decided by you — the citizens. It will not be decided by the owners of social media channels,” Scholz said in a New Year’s message , a not-so-subtle jab at Musk. Scholz added that “it won’t be the person who yells loudest who will decide where Germany goes from here,” but instead, it will “be up to the vast majority of reasonable and decent people.”
The party that Musk is backing is vehemently anti-immigration, and regularly downplays the atrocities of Nazism. An editor for a prominent newspaper in Germany has resigned in protest after the paper published an op-ed in which billionaire Elon Musk endorsed a far right political party. Earlier this month, Musk signaled his support for Alternative for Germany (AfD) ahead of elections set to be held in that country in February. AfD is widely recognized as a reactionary political party , emphasizing anti-immigration policies, particularly against Muslim migrants. Leaders of the party have frequently espoused racist and antisemitic statements, and have pushed for a return to a German “identity” — echoing rhetoric peddled by leaders of the Nazi Party during the mid-20th century. AfD has also called for changing how Nazism is viewed historically within Germany. The party has suggested, for example, that monuments, schools and museums depicting the horrors of the Nazi regime, including the Holocaust, be altered, with one AfD party leader minimizing the atrocities perpetrated by the Nazis as “just a speck of bird’s muck.” Other leaders have outright denied that the Holocaust even occurred. “Only the AfD can save Germany,” Musk wrote in a post on X , the social media site formerly known as Twitter. This past weekend, the billionaire elaborated on his views, writing an op-ed once again endorsing AfD as his choice to lead the country. The AfD is “the last spark of hope” for Germany, Musk claimed in the opinion pages of Welt am Sonntag , the newspaper in question, adding that he believed only that party can “lead the country into a future where economic prosperity, cultural integrity and technological innovation.” Musk also mischaracterized AfD’s far right views, describing depictions of the party as “right-wing extremist” as being “false,” citing a single example of a member of the party having a same-sex partner. “Does that sound like Hitler to you?” Musk asked in the op-ed, disregarding the fact that the AfD opposes marriage equality in Germany . Musk’s op-ed was run alongside another, from the incoming editor-in-chief of Welt Jan Philipp Burgard. However, while that opinion piece expressed disagreement with Musk, it was gentle in condemning his endorsement of AfD. “Musk’s diagnosis is correct, but his therapeutic approach, that only the AfD can save Germany, is fatally wrong,” Burgard’s op-ed stated . Several journalists working for Welt expressed their anger to higher-ups at the paper for allowing Musk’s op-ed to run . Eva Marie Kogel, who until last week served as the publication’s opinion editor, resigned in protest of the decision to run the op-ed. “I always enjoyed heading the opinion section of WELT … Today, an article by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag, ” Kogel wrote on X . “I handed in my resignation yesterday after it went to print.” Kogel received accolades on social media for taking a stand against the paper. “I hope that Eva Marie Kogel will find a good home elsewhere and receive the support she deserves. Her integrity and courage deserve to be recognized,” German journalist Katharina Lotter wrote on Bluesky . “Respect for Eva Marie Kogel, previously head of the opinion section at WELT,” Der Spiegel journalist Oliver Das Gupta wrote . “Thank you, Eva Marie Kogel. May many more follow your example and walk upright into the new year,” author Katja Diehl said .
Instead of top-down regulation, we need bottom-up scrutiny of mis- and disinformation based on critical media literacy. Instead of top-down regulation, we need bottom-up scrutiny of mis- and disinformation based on critical media literacy. Every year, Project Censored publishes its State of the Free Press , which takes the pulse of the media and shares the 25 most important but underreported stories of the past year. In State of the Free Press 2025 (The Censored Press & Seven Stories Press, December 3, 2024, paperback), editors Mickey Huff, Shealeigh Voitl and Andy Lee Roth look back on a year in which significant news stories lost out to coverage of celebrities and nonevents. This year’s book also includes an in-depth analysis of mis- and disinformation. In this interview, the editors discuss how these terms are deployed for political ends, dispel myths about them, and offer an incisive take on the real dangers of mis- and disinformation. As longtime free speech advocates, they also share strategies for combating mis- and disinformation without compromising free speech. The following transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Peter Handel: Since the first Trump administration, we’ve heard a lot about misinformation and disinformation. How do these two differ? How are they different from or comparable to propaganda? Shealeigh Voitl: These are terms that should not be used interchangeably. Misinformation often happens accidentally. People hold or share false or mistaken beliefs without ever realizing they’re inaccurate. Like last year, when several X (formerly Twitter) users warned of an earthquake they believed occurred in Dubai, but in fact, it was the demolition of a nearby skyscraper. By contrast, disinformation is intentional and happens when a person or people spread unsubstantiated information to exert influence. Think of former President Donald Trump’s “Big Lie” of a stolen 2020 election, which galvanized members of his base, cementing their loyalty for the most recent 2024 presidential election. Disinformation uses these deliberate untruths to influence public opinion, bolster existing power structures, and, ultimately, achieve political goals. Bill Yousman explores these ideas in “Eleven Theses on Disinformation (with Apologies to Karl Marx),” his chapter in State of the Free Press 2025 , which describes disinformation as a “subset” of propaganda. Yousman’s argument also emphasizes how easily disinformation disguises itself as trustworthy or credible, making it especially dangerous in a time of rapid digital communication. How does the corporate ownership of most U.S. establishment media contribute to this problem? Are there recent examples of this? And how do you think it needs to change? Andy Lee Roth: Corporate news is filtered news. It not only reflects corporate interests but also serves the political agendas of those in positions of power. Recall, for example, the firestorm The New York Times ignited on December 31, 2023, when it published “Screams Without Words,” which allegedly documented the mass rape of Israeli women by Hamas on October 7, 2023. On publication of the Times ’s report, independent journalists raised serious questions about the credibility of the article’s key sources and the troubling fact that one of the story’s authors was a former Israeli intelligence official with no background in journalism. In addition to independent journalists, media scholars also sought to hold the Times accountable for its flawed report. In April 2024, some 200 professors of journalism and media scholars from across the U.S. sent an open letter to the publisher, expressing concern about the story’s integrity and the editorial judgment that led to its publication. Their letter noted that the impact of the newspaper’s report was “impossible to fathom” because it “fueled the fire at a pivotal moment” when there was an opportunity to contain the situation in Gaza before it devolved into what the International Court of Justice has deemed the “plausible” realm of genocide. In May 2024, the Pulitzer Prize Board awarded its prize for international reporting to The New York Times for its “wide-ranging and revelatory coverage of Hamas’ lethal attack on southern Israel on October 7.” Although the award did not specifically cite “Screams Without Words,” how could the Pulitzer jury have ignored the unanswered questions and deep doubts raised by the newspaper’s problematic story and its subsequent lack of transparency about the editorial decisions that led to its publication? This is just one recent, extraordinarily catastrophic example of how corporate news media disseminate disinformation. As Yousman notes in his chapter from State of the Free Press 2025 , the Times ’s “history of misleading and deceitful reporting” dates back to its coverage of the Russian Revolution and includes slanted coverage of a host of U.S. military interventions. We all remember how the Times notoriously promoted the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. and its allies through its now-discredited reporting on Iraq’s possession of “weapons of mass destruction.” Many in the corporate media claimed that Russia was behind major mis- and disinformation campaigns that helped secure Trump’s first win. What do you think of this? Mickey Huff: Since the 2016 election, many corporate media outlets have contributed to heightened public concerns around the specter of Russian meddling in presidential elections that favored Trump. As we have noted in several of our publications , while there was evidence of Russian meddling, the degree and effectiveness of those efforts were exaggerated, some manufactured, and in many cases have been outright debunked, including by Harvard media scholar Yochai Benkler and investigative journalists like Jeff Gerth , among many others. That hasn’t stopped outlets like MSNBC , CNN , The Washington Post , and other legacy media from turning Russiagate into a cottage industry. This fixation on Russia serves to distract attention from the corporate media’s widespread, dismal reporting on a variety of key issues. The U.S. has more than its share of problems with hyper-partisanship, sensational infotainment, Team Red/Team Blue propaganda, and its own false news to further political and cultural divides . These issues with the media leave the U.S. public in the dark about the most pressing matters of the day, including a worsening climate crisis, the collapse of the working and middle classes, unattainable and expensive health care, and the nation’s continued funding and support of Israel’s genocide in Gaza, which a majority of the U.S. public opposed even earlier this year. If we are going to be concerned about Russia, it should be in the context of its war in Ukraine, where ongoing U.S. military support and financing is poking the bear, pushing the Doomsday Clock closer to midnight than ever before. It is not uncommon now to hear some commentators — even liberal ones, who have traditionally championed free speech — call for government or corporate regulations to combat mis- and disinformation. Project Censored has always been an outspoken opponent of free speech limitation by either the public or private sectors. How do you think the problem should be addressed? Lee Roth: If we outsource regulation of information to corporate entities or government agencies, then who fact-checks the fact-checkers? As Project Censored has previously noted , corporate news outlets that promote top-down regulation of speech and information tend to sidestep this basic question. Does it make sense, for example, to authorize NewsGuard to decide what counts as trustworthy or not when we know that its founding advisory board was a who’s who of former Homeland Security, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials, not to mention representatives from telecommunication giants such as AT&T? Instead of top-down regulation, we need bottom-up scrutiny of misinformation and disinformation based on critical media literacy and the principles of ethical journalism . Critical media literacy is for everyone , which is why Project Censored provides a wide range of resources — from trustworthy independent news sources and classroom guides for educators to infographics and short-form videos — that people can use to develop their media literacy skills. Some citizens may be tempted to approve of free speech regulations given that they come with the promise of routing out dangerous mis- and disinformation. Even if they recognize the value of free speech, they may see this as a necessary, if uncomfortable, compromise. What are some concerns about this stance that you would urge them to consider? Huff: Some of these concerns have been noted in previous responses here, especially regarding false and misleading reporting from major outlets that not only escaped real scrutiny but garnered awards. On the other hand, many independent media outlets have been subject to varying degrees of admonishment and censorship (e.g., deplatforming , demonetization , shadow-banning ) for accurately reporting on similar matters. In terms of public concern regarding mis- and disinformation, there is a double standard when so-called mainstream outlets get a pass or are assumed to be authoritative (e.g., “the paper of record”) while independent ones are automatically deemed suspect. It’s like we’re living in some kind of bizarro upside-down world, which in some ways exemplifies the problematic “post-truth” world we seem to inhabit since the 2016 election. It should be noted that the 2016 Oxford Dictionary “Word of the Year” was “ post-truth .” As Trump returns to the White House, the “Word of the Year” for 2024 is “ brain rot .” It seems like a pattern is emerging, with social and corporate media playing a significant role in creating more “ low-information voters .” Again, Yousman’s chapter in our latest book addresses the many challenges of balancing free speech and free press rights while managing the increasing flow of mis- and disinformation, especially online. As Lee Roth noted, efforts to regulate and curate such content is a very slippery slope, whether by government or by proxy via corporate entities, especially in Big Tech. Support for such censorious measures, even if seemingly well-intentioned, creates a hierarchy of information often buttressed by confirmation bias and status quo conditioning. What we need is more critical thinking and critical media literacy education , so we can help teach the public how to think, not what to think, spurring more meaningful civic engagement . Among more recent attacks on free expression and press freedoms done in the name of combating alleged misinformation, House Resolution 9495 passed the House (with 15 Democrats supporting) and would give the Treasury secretary unilateral power to remove by decree the 501(c)(3) status of any nonprofit for “supporting terrorism.” The nonprofits already targeted by this bill include mostly organizations that oppose the genocide in Gaza and are human rights advocates for Palestinians, but it will impact other left-leaning nonprofits as well under the incoming Trump administration. Should the bill pass, even if nonprofit status isn’t revoked, the looming threat would be an ever-present chilling effect. Such censorship is beyond problematic and it must be resisted at every turn. What is one specific thing anyone can do to make themselves more news literate and less vulnerable to mis- and disinformation? Lee Roth: You can learn a lot by looking at the sources cited by journalists in their reporting. For any given story, focus on who’s treated as an authorized source by the news outlet. In other words, who is quoted in print articles, and who gets to speak when a TV story includes sound bites? Do those sources reflect a diversity of perspectives on the topic, or have some relevant viewpoints been marginalized or blockaded? Do those sources provide critical leverage on the topic, or are they all saying the same thing? Establishment news outlets tend to rely on official sources, whether they’re government or corporate officials. Even when news outlets seek to fulfill their heralded role as watchdogs by alerting the public to abuses of power, reporting based on official sources and conventional narratives tends to reinforce the status quo. As we at Project Censored often note, narrow definitions of who counts as “newsworthy” often reflect a fundamental assumption that “news” is primarily about what people in power do and say. That definition promotes the subtle but nasty misconception that most of the public is irrelevant or inconsequential when it comes to addressing important political issues. Many of the independent news stories highlighted by Project Censored tell a different kind of story, focused on how ordinary people, acting together, empower themselves to confront systemic injustices and abuses of power. For example, this edition of State of the Free Press features reporting on Indigenous activists in Panama shutting down a notorious copper mine that threatened local water supplies and forests; and on activists in New York, Colorado and California who publicly protested outside the offices of insurance companies that still support fossil fuel projects for those companies’ role in the climate crisis. Reporting like that not only informs the public, it can also inspire people to organize and take action on comparable issues affecting their own communities.
Ahead of the House speaker election, Mike Johnson is stuck between Trump and the hard right of the House. With hours left before the U.S. government was slated to run out of money last week, Elon Musk and Donald Trump took to social media to strong-arm the House GOP into abandoning a bipartisan deal to keep the government open. Musk — who has taken to behaving like an unelected potentate — aimed a barrage of postings at GOP Congress members who were thinking of voting for the short-term spending bill. The social media posts came as Musk was also endorsing Germany’s Neo-Nazi A lternative for Germany (AfD) party in the country’s upcoming elections. Then, hours later, Trump — who on such matters of state spending has all-too-visibly taken a backseat to his centi-billionaire benefactor — weighed in with a series of impossible demands built around the GOP entirely scrapping the debt ceiling to give his incoming administration carte blanche for no-limits spending. A day after the Musk-Trump ultimatum was issued, an opportunistic alliance of Democrats and ultraconservative Republicans rejected the legislation Trump’s team had demanded. And shortly after that, Congress passed — and President Biden signed — a much slimmed down version of the original legislation to keep government funded until the spring. The bill did not contain a provision to abolish the debt ceiling and makes it all-but-certain that conservatives will be able to push another messy political fight over spending just months into the new Trump presidency. The Musk-Trump attempt, days before Christmas, to scupper legislation needed to keep government functioning and government funds flowing, turned out to be a ham-fisted effort at arm-twisting that ended up alienating core parts of the Trump congressional coalition. Trump emerged from the fight bruised and, arguably, weakened. But so did House Speaker Mike Johnson. Never a natural fit for the speakership, he has ended up alienating the incoming president — and his Musk-ovite henchman — mere weeks before he faces his own re-election moment in the House. In the abstract, getting rid of the debt ceiling isn’t a bad idea. Progressive Democrats have routinely expressed their fury at the leverage it gives to the most anti-government wing of the GOP. Those members have, in recent years, attempted to use the issue as a way to blackmail their colleagues into accepting their agenda of slashing spending while cutting taxes for the wealthy in exchange for not letting the U.S. government default on its debt obligations. And at times over the past four years, the risk of default has grown so large that some constitutional law scholars have even urged President Biden to invoke the 14 th Amendment — part of which states that the government will not default on its debts — to bypass an intransigent Congress. But Musk and Trump haven’t had a come-to-Jesus conversion moment around the importance of adequate government spending on services vital to the well-being of the country. In fact, Musk’s inchoate Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has only just begun to use the threat of massive government cuts in order to tame the federal civil service and bend it entirely to the will of Musk-Trump. This is about the balance of power: In the same way that Trump floated the idea of recessing Congress to bypass the Senate ’s powers to confirm (or block) his cabinet nominees, so, having slogged through government shutdowns during his first term in office, he now wants to unilaterally concentrate the power to shape a financial agenda in the executive branch of government, largely removing the House of Representatives’ control over the purse strings. Trump sought to intimidate GOP congress members, by making it clear that he would encourage primary challenges against any member who supported the legislation, which included several Democratic priorities, to temporarily secure additional funds for the government. And, as gleefully noted by right-wing media outlets , he issued a double-edged note of optimism to Johnson, saying that he thought the speaker, who is up for re-election, would do just fine … so long as he had the wisdom to pull the bipartisan deal. Johnson is all too aware that he only acquired his current job after his own caucus members defenestrated former Speaker Kevin McCarthy for daring to negotiate with the Democrats to keep government open a few debt ceiling spending fights back, and that he only got there after pretty much every other plausible candidate dropped out of contention. So, duly chastened, the current speaker immediately pulled the bill and set his caucus to work on penning new legislation that would fund the government enough to keep it up and running through the presidential transition period. In Trump’s imagination, Congress ought to be there to pass politically popular tax cuts. Despite his big talk on lowering government spending, he seems less keen on cutting spending on programs that his constituents use so as to fund these tax cuts. Instead, he wants the freedom to borrow more and more and more money as a hedge against the austerity politics demanded by so many on the right of his own party. In his first term, Trump explosively added to the national debt to the tune of roughly eight trillion dollars . His current set of proposals seem likely to prove an encore to this unseemly economic performance. Unfortunately for Trump, that economic worldview is anathema to many Freedom Caucus-styled Congress members, who have long sought to tie debt ceiling increases to cuts in overall government spending; and over the course of a frenetic 24 hours, dozens of ultraconservatives in Congress balked at passing legislation that would essentially strip Congress of one of its prime levers of control over the nation’s purse strings, and make it far easier for a strong president to basically push his personal wish-lists of tax cuts combined with spending on pet projects such as the border wall, with no concern for the long-term fiscal implications. There are few things on this earth that would convince dozens of this current crop of GOP congress members, beholden as they are to the MAGA base, to vote against the explicit orders of Donald J. Trump. But one of those things, it appears, is the nation’s debt ceiling. In presiding over passage of a government spending bill that didn’t meet Trump’s needs on the debt ceiling, Speaker Johnson’s challenges have suddenly become a whole lot bigger . At the best of times, Johnson’s hold over the GOP caucus, and its vanishingly slim majority in the House, has been tenuous. He managed to pass legislation continuing to fund Ukraine’s efforts to repel Russia’s invasion only with the backing of Democrats . A week after winning the presidential election, Trump endorsed Johnson’s re-election efforts ; now, however, the speaker has been unable to deliver the House on a key Trump demand. In consequence, it is more likely that, early in the new year, Johnson’s fractious House members will fail to unite in the way that is needed to deliver the votes that would keep him in control of the speaker’s gavel. It all speaks volumes to the chaos likely to engulf the Capitol over the coming years as Trump, governing by social media pronouncement, seeks to accumulate presidential powers at the expense of the other branches of government.
Musk’s role in almost forcing a government shutdown this week has revived calls for campaign finance reform. Trump-backer and richest person alive Elon Musk’s role in almost forcing a government shutdown this week has revived calls for campaign finance reform, both nationally and within the Democratic Party. As part of his campaign against a bipartisan continuing resolution (CR) that would have funded the government through March 14, Musk said that Republicans who voted for the bill should lose their seats during the 2026 midterms and that he would fund moderate primary challengers to Democrats in safe districts. “The threat of limitless super-PAC spending from the world’s wealthiest man could have proven enough to shut down the federal government days before Christmas,” Joseph Geevarghese, the executive director of Our Revolution, told Common Dreams . “If there’s ever been a time to discuss serious campaign finance reform, it is now. We are sliding into a new era of American oligarchy, and unless we take decisive action, the integrity of our democracy is at risk.” Before the shutdown showdown, Musk was already incredibly influential in politics as a financial backer: He spent at least $277 million on the campaigns of President-elect Donald Trump and other Republicans in 2024, including over $19 million on House races alone. Musk also spoke at Trump campaign rallies and was tapped by the president-elect to co-lead a new Department of Government Efficiency with fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy. However, his efforts to sink a spending bill revealed by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on Tuesday raised fresh concerns about his influence on elected politicians. His initial barrage of complaints against the CR — posted on his social media site X on Wednesday — precipitated a statement against the bill by Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance. Johnson never brought the bill up for a vote. As part of his initial Wednesday tweet storm, Musk wrote , “Any member of the House or Senate who votes for this outrageous spending bill deserves to be voted out in 2 years!” In response to Musk’s threats, Rep. Richard Neal (D-Mass.), the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, gave an impassioned speech on the House floor on Thursday. “Can you image what the next two years are going to be like if every time that Congress works its will and then there’s a tweet? Or from an individual who has no official portfolio, who threatens members on the Republican side with a primary and they succumb?” Neal said. Musk, in response to a video of Neal’s speech, tweeted , “Oh… forgot to mention that I’m also going to be funding moderate candidates in heavily Democrat districts, so that the country can get rid of those who don’t represent them, like this jackass.” The statement sparked outrage and resistance from congressional Democrats. “Everyone knows I’m always ready,” Neal told Business Insider , while the Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee tweeted out sarcastic memes. Real ones know this isn’t our first scrap — Ways and Means Democrats (@WaysMeansCmte) December 20, 2024 Real ones know this isn’t our first scrap Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called for change on social media on Friday , writing, “How about the House add campaign finance reform to the CR so Republicans and Democrats alike can stop being so scared about what a billionaire man-child thinks before they vote on anything around here?” Ultimately, after another Republican-led spending bill failed to clear the House on Thursday, Johnson introduced a paired-down CR that included key measures backed by Democrats such as relief for disaster victims and aid for farmers. That bill passed the House on Friday and the Senate early Saturday, narrowly averting a government shutdown that would have deprived hundreds of thousands of federal employees of paychecks over the holidays. But Musk’s intervention established a precedent “that should upset every American who believes in our democratic form of government,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said. “Musk is getting carried away with himself, using his limitless fortune and his ownership of X to try to turn American politics to the authoritarian right,” former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich wrote on his Substack on Friday. “Wealth inequality is rapidly undermining our democracy,” Reich continued. “Musk is the poster boy for a wealth tax.” Musk’s primary challenge to Neal bolstered calls for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to ban super PAC spending in its primaries. “Elon Musk , worth $455 billion, spent $277 million to buy the Republican Party,” Sanders staff director Warren Gunnels wrote on social media on Friday. “He has also pledged to replace Democrats in primaries with those who represent his special interests. If the DNC doesn’t ban super PACs in primaries, what will this picture look like in 2 years?” Yes. Elon Musk, worth $455 billion, spent $277 million to buy the Republican Party. He has also pledged to replace Democrats in primaries with those who represent his special interests. If the DNC doesn’t ban super PACs in primaries, what will this picture look like in 2 years? — Warren Gunnels (@GunnelsWarren) December 20, 2024 Yes. Elon Musk, worth $455 billion, spent $277 million to buy the Republican Party. He has also pledged to replace Democrats in primaries with those who represent his special interests. If the DNC doesn’t ban super PACs in primaries, what will this picture look like in 2 years? Reich also argued that “the DNC must bar dark money and limit campaign contributions in all Democratic primary campaigns. The incoming chair of the DNC, selected on February 1, should make this a key part of their strategy for the 2026 midterms and beyond.”
The final bill extends government funding through March 14 and excludes Trump’s demand to raise the debt ceiling. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill 366-34 on Friday night to continuing funding the government, averting the shutdown that loomed after Elon Musk and President-elect Donald Trump sank a bipartisan spending agreement earlier in the week. The Senate then approved the continuing resolution 85-11 early Saturday, which will keep the government funded at current levels through March 14. It also included the disaster relief and aid to farmers that were central pieces of the original bipartisan legislation and excluded Trump’s last-minute demand to raise the debt ceiling . However, it was significantly smaller than the original bill — slashed from 1,500 to 118 pages — and the cuts included healthcare expansion for older Americans, a plan to lower prescription drug prices, and an apprenticeship program for young people. “Tonight, in a victory for the American people and a loss for Donald Trump and Elon Musk, the House passed legislation to keep the government open, provide $100 billion in critical disaster relief to communities across America, and fund $10 billion in aid for struggling farmers and ranchers,” outgoing Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash) said in a statement. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) also celebrated the averted shutdown. “We stopped extreme MAGA Republicans from shutting down the government and crashing the economy,” he wrote on Bluesky. “The American people have won this round. Far-right billionaires have lost. The struggle continues in the new year.” The bill’s passage capped a whirlwind few days in the U.S. House after Musk — the richest man in the world whom Trump has appointed to co-lead a new Department of Government Efficiency — spent all of Wednesday tweeting against the original spending package released by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on Tuesday. After Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance joined Musk’s crusade against the bill, Johnson refrained from bringing it to the floor. Instead, he attempted to pass another bill on Thursday that would have raised the debt limit through 2027, in accordance with Trump’s request. That bill was voted down 174-235, with only two Democrats voting in favor and 38 Republicans rejecting it. Johnson then briefly considered passing individual bills Friday morning before introducing the proposal that finally passed with the support of 170 Republicans and every Democrat except Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), who voted present. “We forced President-elect Trump and Shadow President Elon Musk to back down from the 11th-hour demand to pass a suspension of the debt ceiling, a move that would have paved the way for a Trump Tax Scam 2.0 that would once again send trillions of dollars to the billionaires and giant corporations while cutting Social Security and Medicare for working people and poor people to pay for those tax cuts to the wealthiest,” Jayapal said. “Democrats forced Republicans to back down and, when we enter a Republican trifecta, it will be on Republicans to deliver all the votes for such a scam. Democrats won’t bail them out—on that or any of their policies that cater to the wealthiest in America at the expense of working people and struggling Americans.” The passage of the disaster aid was celebrated by more than 50 storm and fire survivors who had sent a delegation to Congress last week to share their stories and demand that Congress fully fund recovery efforts, as federal dollars for relief have been delayed by over two years. “We commend Republicans and Democrats for prioritizing disaster aid—this is how it should be,” said Amanda Devecka-Rinear, co-founder of an organization of Superstorm Sandy survivors. “But the maneuvering we just witnessed, including an unelected billionaire holding disaster aid hostage via the social media platform that he owns, once again underscores how precarious the reality is for disaster survivors in America. And we will continue to stand together to get our communities home and whole.” While Devecka-Rinear said the funding “represents a significant step forward,” she added that it was “not the finish line.” “Stopgap measures like this cannot continue to be the norm,” she said. “We need a disaster recovery system that families can successfully navigate. Survivors deserve reliable, sustainable, and permanent funding.” Zoe Middleton, the associate director for just climate resilience for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, also called for a permanent disaster-relief solution. “Communities need and deserve robustly funded recovery programs to get back on their feet in the weeks and months following a disaster,” Middleton said in a statement. “Allowing funding for short-term relief to run dry and making communities wait on long-term recovery assistance can push families into debt or leave them homeless and can also cause lasting economic scars on local economies.” She continued: “People across the country are losing their homes and livelihoods to the climate crisis while fossil fuel companies continue to rake in profits. In addition to passing this short-term, stopgap funding, Congress should invest in measures that prepare climate-vulnerable communities for disasters before they strike and permanently authorize Community Development Block Grants to ensure people aren’t forced into desperate straits after they’ve experienced the worst.” The bill’s passage also sets the stage for the coming year, in which Republicans will control the presidency, House, and Senate — foreshadowing future fights and revealing the extent of Musk’s influence over the future president and Republican lawmakers. During closed-door negotiations, Republican House members on Friday shared a slide showing a draft agreement to swap $2.5 trillion in spending cuts for a $1.5 trillion debt-ceiling increase next year. Cuts could target essential programs including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and federal nutrition assistance. “Republicans are already taking cues from Elon Musk and his DOGE commission and clearing the deck to ram through giant tax giveaways for the ultra-wealthy,” Groundwork Collaborative executive director Lindsay Owens said in a statement. “Their plans for the new year are crystal clear: Cut trillions from Social Security, Medicare, and other critical programs to pay for their own massive tax cuts.” Jayapal said that Democrats would need “spines of steel to oppose all of the ways in which Republicans inflict cruelty on America’s working people and poor people who are still struggling to get by and deserve so much more.” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who voted against the continuing resolution, lamented key provisions that had been cut from the spending bill after Musk and Trump’s opposition. These included measures to expand primary healthcare, mental healthcare, substance abuse counseling, and nutrition programs for older Americans; boost vocational training for 100,000 young people; and attempt to regulate Pharmacy Benefit Managers, who inflate prescription drug costs. “These important proposals, negotiated by Democrats and Republicans for months and agreed to by both sides of the aisle, were stripped from this bill by an unelected billionaire named Elon Musk,” Sanders said. “Musk, the richest person on Earth, threatened to use his fortune to unseat any member of Congress who would have voted for the original bipartisan legislation.” Sanders concluded: “The precedent that has been set today in Congress should upset every American who believes in our democratic form of government. It appears that from now on no major legislation can be passed without the approval of the wealthiest person in this country. That’s not democracy, that’s oligarchy.”
Musk is backing a vehemently anti-immigrant, far right party in Germany’s upcoming elections. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) has called out Republicans for acquiescing to billionaire Elon Musk’s demands to thwart a bipartisan spending bill that was needed to fend off a government shutdown this weekend. In his comments, Sanders derided Musk — who is co-leading president-elect Donald Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency — as an authoritarian oligarchic. The bipartisan spending bill that Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) negotiated with Democrats would have funded the government through March. However, after Musk urged GOP lawmakers to oppose the bill , Johnson, sensing he wouldn’t have enough support from his own party, scrapped the legislation, and put up a new spending bill without Democratic Party input. That bill also failed to pass after Democrats in the House voted against it, with dozens of Republicans opposing the bill, albeit for different ideological reasons. Musk’s influence within the Republican Party is so inviolable that some in the GOP have actually called for him to replace Johnson as Speaker of the House . Musk and Trump have said that Republicans who do not support the spending bills they endorse should be primaried out of their seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Musk has also said that he’s not opposed to shutting down the government until Trump is inaugurated in mid-January. “Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, is threatening to unseat elected officials if they do not follow his orders to shut down the government during the holidays,” Sanders noted in a recent social media post . “Are we still a democracy or have we already moved to oligarchy and authoritarianism?” Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, is threatening to unseat elected officials if they do not follow his orders to shut down the government during the holidays. Are we still a democracy or have we already moved to oligarchy and authoritarianism? In an earlier post, Sanders derided Musk as being an oligarch who Republicans adhered to. “The US Congress this week came to an agreement to fund our government. Elon Musk, who became $200 BILLION richer since Trump was elected, objected,” Sanders wrote . “Are Republicans beholden to the American people? Or President Musk? This is oligarchy at work.” Hours after Sanders’s comments, Musk signaled his support for a neo-fascist political party in Germany’s February elections. In a post on his social media site X, Musk endorsed Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far right, anti-immigrant and antisemitic party that is gaining popularity among conservative Germans. “Only the AfD can save Germany,” the billionaire wrote . Musk has previously endorsed other far right figures in Europe, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and United Kingdom Reform party leader Nigel Farage. Musk has tried to normalize AfD’s views in the past, claiming they “don’t sound extremist” to him and questioning if he was “missing something.” AfD is vehemently anti-immigration , particularly with regard to Muslims, calling for a “net zero” number of immigrants entering Germany in the coming years. Leaders of the party have repeatedly made racist and antisemitic statements, emphasizing a need to return to a German “identity” and pushing other white nationalist views; AfD leader Alexander Gauland, for example, has described immigration to the country as an “invasion of foreigners” that he and his party intend to fight off . The party has also called for changes to how Nazi Germany is depicted in historical settings, such as monuments, schools and museums, with Gauland once minimizing the country’s Nazi history as being no more than “just a speck of bird’s muck.” Other AfD members have denied Nazi wrongdoing, including by describing the Holocaust as a “myth.” Musk’s public support for AfD is just the latest example of the billionaire sharing reactionary viewpoints on X. Musk has, for example, called for the deportation of protesters utilizing the First Amendment to express views he disagrees with. He has also promoted antisemitic , anti-Muslim , transphobic and other bigoted content on his profile, and has shared content denying the Holocaust. Novelist and political commentator Patrick S. Tomlinson has said that Musk’s support for AfD is illuminating. “The AfD is Germany’s neo-Nazi party,” Tomlinson wrote on Bluesky . “They are anti-immigration, anti-EU, and unapologetically pro-Putin. The German courts have labeled the entire party extremist. Elon Musk has gone fully mask off.” Commentator Paul Krugman also weighed in on Musk’s latest endorsement, noting that the billionaire’s statement was “obviously where he was going.” When it comes to fascist sentiments, Musk “isn’t hiding it at all,” Krugman added.
Congress now has less than 12 hours to scramble for a new funding deal after the unelected billionaire’s intervention. Congressional Democrats on Friday continued to target billionaire Elon Musk and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for forcing a last-minute scramble to prevent a government shutdown shortly before the winter holidays. “I’m ready to stay here through Christmas because we’re not going to let Elon Musk run the government,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said in a Friday statement. “Put simply, we should not let an unelected billionaire rip away research for pediatric cancer so he can get a tax cut or tear down policies that help America outcompete China because it could hurt his bottom line.” “We had a bipartisan deal — we should stick to it. The deal that was already agreed to would responsibly fund the government, offer badly needed disaster relief to communities across America, and deliver some good bipartisan policy reforms,” she added. “The American people do not want chaos or a costly government shutdown all because an unelected billionaire wants to call the shots — I am ready to work with Republicans and Democrats to pass the bipartisan deal both sides negotiated as soon as possible.” If Congress doesn’t act before midnight, a government shutdown could begin overnight — a possibility the White House Office of Management and Budget is warning federal agencies to prepare for, according to Washington Post reporter Jeff Stein. After Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy — the two billionaires Trump has tapped to co-lead his forthcoming Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — came out against the initial bipartisan deal on Wednesday, the president-elect swiftly followed suit , leading progressive critics to dub Musk, the world’s richest person, a “ shadow president ” a month before the inauguration. Faced with that opposition and Trump’s sudden call for the continuing resolution to also raise the country’s debt ceiling , House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) on Thursday evening held a vote on a bill that would address that demand and fund the government for three months — but it was rejected by 38 Republicans and all but two Democrats. Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, on Thursday night called out Musk on his own social media platform, X, and argued that “Congress must not yield to out-of-touch billionaires.” There was an agreement between Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate—until Elon Musk ordered Republicans to break it. Congress must not yield to out of touch billionaires. Hardworking Americans depend on us to govern. After voting against the so-called American Relief Act (H.R. 10515) on Thursday, Congresswoman Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.) said in a statement that “we had an agreement. A bipartisan negotiated continuing resolution. But then the Republicans’ billionaire bosses — Trump and Musk — got involved, and Republicans showed us *exactly* who they work for.” “In the last 48 hours, the Republicans have shown, AGAIN, that their agenda is the corporate billionaire, big money in politics agenda,” she continued. “In order to meet their bosses’ expectations, they offer up vulnerable Americans as an offering, sacrificing working people’s healthcare, children’s research, elderly people’s affordable prescription drugs, and much, much more.” “And they are laying the groundwork to make the rich richer through tax cuts for the ultrawealthy in the 119th Congress,” Ramirez warned. “If the Republicans want to make the rich richer, the poor poorer, and the sick sicker, they will have to pass this continuing resolution without me. I work for everyday Americans. I am not beholden to billionaires. I voted NO.” With less than 12 hours until a shutdown, Senate Democrats are putting the blame on Johnson, who is shifting to Plan C: three separate votes on “a short-term funding bill, money for recent natural disasters, and a one-year farm bill extension with aid for farmers,” Politico reported Friday. According to the outlet: The new plan will test his ability to wrangle his conference. Members believe Johnson is taking the proposal through the Rules Committee, trying to pass it through regular order so it only requires a simple majority on the House floor. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), who is on the panel, said that he will back the plan, meaning it should have enough support to get out of the committee. But then things get trickier. Johnson would need near unity from his conference to bring it up for debate on the floor, known as voting for the rule. Democrats typically don’t vote for rules and are loath to help bail out Republicans after they backed away from a bipartisan funding agreement earlier this week. “Republicans have the House majority — they should be able to pass whatever they want. If they need our votes, they have to come to the table and negotiate,” outgoing Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said Friday. “That’s what happened, and we struck a bipartisan deal. But then they blew it up because of a tweet from a billionaire. Insane.” The shutdown threat comes as Republicans prepare to control not only the White House but also both chambers of Congress next year. Reporting on the GOP’s Friday leadership meeting, Punchbowl News founder Jake Sherman said that a slide was displayed for a debt ceiling agreement that would “raise the debt limit by $1.5 trillion in the ‘first reconciliation package’ alongside a promise to CUT $2.5 trillion in ‘net mandatory spending in the reconciliation process.'” Responding to Sherman on X, the advocacy group Social Security Works noted : “The ONLY WAY to cut $2.5 trillion in spending is by slashing Social Security, Medicare, and/or Medicaid. Republicans want to steal our benefits to pay for their billionaire tax cuts.”
The US Constitution does not stipulate that the speaker has to be a current member of the House. Several Republican lawmakers in Congress are calling on billionaire Elon Musk, president-elect Donald Trump’s pick to co-lead a purported commission on government efficiency, to replace current Speaker of the House Mike Johnson. Support for Johnson has shifted considerably this week as he tried to pass a continuing resolution bill to fund the government into spring. That measure failed when Musk, and eventually Trump, called on Republicans in the House to vote against it , resulting in Johnson scrapping the bill. Without a new measure to replace it, the federal government is set to shut down this weekend. Many Republicans blame Johnson for the mess, claiming that his negotiating with Democrats — whose votes he needs to pass any spending measure, as some Republicans in the narrowly divided House will vote against any continuing resolution bill — was unacceptable. Lauding Musk’s actions against the bill, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) suggested on the social media site X (which Musk owns) that the billionaire should take over the speakership from Johnson. The U.S. Constitution stipulates that the House of Representatives “shall choose their speaker and other officers.” But it doesn’t require a person to be a duly-elected member of the House before becoming speaker. If Republicans move forward with this plan, it will be the first time ever that a speaker of the House was not also a representative within the House. “The Speaker of the House need not be a member of Congress,” Paul said , adding that he believes Musk would be a good choice to “disrupt the swamp.” Far right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) agreed with Paul’s assessment , saying she could “be open to supporting @elonmusk for Speaker of the House.” Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said that one of the two heads of the soon-to-be-formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — Musk or Vivek Ramaswamy — should become speaker of the House. “I think we need to go outside the box. I think we need to look to a different place,” Lee stated in an interview , adding that GOP lawmakers should “choose one of them — I don’t care which one — to be our speaker.” Some Democratic lawmakers also joked that Musk should run the House, issuing tongue-in-cheek commentaries on how he seemingly already runs it, as the billionaire recently managed to kill spending bills through dozens of posts on X. “If Elon Musk is kind of cosplaying co-president here, I don’t know why Trump doesn’t just hand him the Oval Office, or Speaker Johnson should maybe just hand Elon Musk the gavel if they just want that billionaire to run the country,” Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas) told reporters . There would be a slew of concerns if Musk becomes speaker of the House, including over whether he would divest from his business interests. As an acolyte of Trump’s, Musk likely wouldn’t do so, creating considerable conflicts of interest, as he would be tasked with overseeing the passage of legislation that would affect his businesses. Musk and Ramaswamy have made it clear that, as heads of DOGE, they intend to consider making cuts to safety net programs , including Social Security. As speaker of the House, Musk could fast-track legislation that would make those cuts. On social media, Musk frequently peddles conspiracy theories and amplifies antisemitic and transphobic talking points. There’s no question that a Speaker Musk would push anti-trans legislation, as many Republicans relied heavily on fearmongering about trans children to bolster their 2024 campaigns . Musk would likely make an unpopular choice for speaker of the House. According to a Quinnipiac University poll that was published this week , only 39 percent of voters have a favorable view of Musk, while 44 percent say they have an unfavorable view of the billionaire. If Musk were appointed to a role like the speakership, his approval ratings would likely plummet even more. Asked in the same poll whether they liked the idea of Musk playing a prominent role in the Trump administration, only 41 percent of voters said they approved of the idea, while 53 percent said they disapproved.
“It’s clear who’s in charge, and it’s not President-elect Donald Trump,” said Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal. At the behest of billionaire Elon Musk and president-elect Donald Trump, Republicans scrapped a bipartisan agreement to keep the government funded for the next three months on Wednesday, just two days ahead of a deadline for avoiding a shutdown. Knowing he had to secure some votes from Democrats in the near-evenly split House of Representatives, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) had crafted a continuing resolution that included raising the debt limit until March . Now that the bill has been shot down, it’s unclear whether a shutdown can be averted. The bill included a number of Democratic Party demands, such as new regulations for health plan administrators, federal funds to rebuild the collapsed bridge in Baltimore, pay raises for members of Congress, and other provisions. The bill also included agreements to raise funding for responses to natural disasters by more than $110 billion, and $10 billion in additional aid to farmers across the U.S. Upset with the continuing resolution heading for a vote later this week, Musk — who is set to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) within the Trump administration — spent most of Wednesday railing against the bill, publishing more than 100 posts on his social media site X calling for Republicans to oppose it. Within those posts, Musk wrongly stated that Democrats were calling for a 40 percent increase in pay for lawmakers (when, in fact, the raise would have represented a 3.8 percent increase, the first raise for members of Congress since 2009); falsely claimed that the bill would block Republicans from being able to investigate the work of the January 6 committee; and wrongly asserted that the bill would force taxpayers to pay for a new NFL stadium in Washington, D.C. (The bill merely transfers management of an existing stadium to the district.) Musk also claimed that the government and the economy would “be fine” if there were to be a shutdown until Trump becomes president on January 20. Past shutdowns showcase how wrong he is — a shutdown crisis during Trump’s first term as president, for example, cost the U.S. economy $11 billion , and a month-long shutdown right now is likely to cost billions of dollars, too. A lengthy shutdown could also make it harder for people living in the U.S. to access government services . National parks, museums and zoos could temporarily shutter, while other offices could have to shorten hours or close completely. Millions of federal workers would be laid off and others would have to continue working without pay. And while disbursements for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid would continue, under a shutdown it’s possible that recipients of those benefits could see response delays if there are issues with their payments. Following Musk’s tirade on X, Trump announced his opposition to the bill later that day, demanding that the entire legislation be renegotiated. “Republicans must GET SMART and TOUGH,” a joint statement from Trump and vice president-elect J.D. Vance read . Some commentators have noted the timing of Trump’s opposition to the bill. “Johnson probably wouldn’t be in this position if it weren’t for Musk, who spent all day Wednesday stoking rage on the right over Johnson’s deal. There was little evidence Trump cared much about the before that,” read an analysis from Politico’s daily “Playbook.” That analysis continued: The most prominent theory of what happened yesterday is this, per multiple Hill Republicans: Musk, as the anointed co-chair of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency panel, got waaay out over his spending-slashing skis and backed Trump into a corner. Indeed, there are other indications that Trump wasn’t initially opposed to the bill’s passage, as he had privately urged Johnson to pass a continuing resolution right after he was elected president this year, to avoid any drama at the start of his term next month. Perhaps trying to steer the spotlight back onto himself, Trump has now called for abolishing the debt ceiling, stating in a phone interview with NBC News that doing so would be the “smartest thing could do,” and that he would “support that entirely.” Trump also claimed that the debt ceiling “doesn’t mean anything, except psychologically” — demonstrating a deep lack of understanding regarding what the debt ceiling actually is. Over the past decade, there have been several calls to eliminate the need to raise the debt ceiling through legislative decree , including by allowing the president to issue an executive order to raise the debt ceiling. But the debt ceiling, which is the amount the federal government is authorized to borrow in debt, would still exist if that were the case. Ridding the U.S. of the debt ceiling entirely could feasibly lower the credit of the country, as happened after a different debt ceiling crisis in 2011 . A significant change in the country’s credit rating could lead to a crisis of its own, in terms of the borrowing power of debt the U.S. could ask for from other countries. Many Democratic lawmakers condemned Musk for his role in blocking the agreement, questioning who is actually set to be “president” of the next administration. “You have to ask Donald Trump if Elon Musk is the one making decisions,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-New Hampshire) told HuffPost . “It’s not Donald Trump asking for this. It’s very clearly President Elon Musk asking for this,” Rep. Daniel Goldman (D-New York) said on Bluesky . Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) also weighed in on the matter, noting that “the richest man on Earth, President Elon Musk,” was responsible for the bill being killed. “Billionaires must not be allowed to run our government,” Sanders added. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington) echoed that sentiment, calling Musk a “shadow president.” “It’s clear who’s in charge, and it’s not President-elect Donald Trump,” Jayapal wrote on social media .
Wall Street insider Bessent seems ready to march in lockstep with Trump on many issues. Wall Street insider Bessent seems ready to march in lockstep with Trump on many issues. Donald Trump is a master of populist demagoguery. He knows exactly when to turn up the volume on his most controversial ideas, and he knows when to dial down again and present an image of “business-as-usual.” In throwing red meat to his base — through committing to mass deportations, promising to eliminate huge swathes of the federal government, and handing the Justice Department over to political ideologues — he promises an almost revolutionary form of political chaos. Yet, at his core, populist speeches and sadistic pledges notwithstanding, Donald Trump is an old-fashioned oligarch — a wealthy man who has spent a lifetime surrounded by other wealthy individuals, measuring his (and others’) worth and competency pretty much entirely by the dollars in their bank accounts, investment funds and real estate ventures. It appears that in Trump’s world, there is simply no room for alternative measures of value — moral integrity, say, or empathy. During his first presidency, until COVID derailed the economy, Trump repeatedly measured his success by the value of the stock market. His first Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, was an unapologetic opponent of economic and banking industry regulations, working to eviscerate the Dodd-Frank Act, which imposed stricter regulations on the financial industry in the wake of the 2008 meltdown, limited predatory lending and enhanced protections for mortgage borrowers. Mnuchin was also a firm believer in tax cuts aimed mainly at benefiting the wealthiest individuals in the U.S. The cabinet and inner circle that Trump has put together this time around reflects his oligarchical tendencies. Put simply, it is chock-full of supremely affluent people. With Elon Musk in the mix, this collection of oligarchic advisers has a collective net worth of nearly half a trillion dollars, thousands of times the financial net worth of the Biden administration. It’s no surprise, therefore, that Trump wants to shift the Treasury Department from being run by a labor economist, Janet Yellen, to being headed by a wealthy hedge fund manager and investor, Scott Bessent, who is the founder and CEO of the investment firm Key Square Group. Bessent is a Yale-educated economist, a man who has apparently carefully studied economic history and the interplay of economic and political forces, and who is a quintessential Wall Street insider. He is in his comfort zone crafting investment strategies for Wall Street’s Masters of the Universe. A married gay man who is raising two children with his husband, Bessent is also far from a typical social conservative and is, at best, an uneasy fit within the MAGA movement. In the early 1990s, while working on investment strategy for George Soros — yes, the same liberal Soros who is MAGA’s favorite punching bag — he helped formulate the multibillion-dollar attack on the value of the British pound that ultimately brought down a conservative British government but, in the process, made a huge amount of money for Soros. Soros has spent the past 30 years using the ill-gotten gains from that merciless financial bet against the British Central Bank to fund progressive causes around the world. Bessent, meanwhile, used a portion of his share of the proceeds by donating to Democratic politicians in the 1990s and early 2000s. Included among these were Al Gore, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Over the last 15 years, however, his politics have apparently shifted rightward, and in recent election cycles, he has been a reliable GOP contributor and also an increasingly vocal defender of Trump’s economic priorities — in particular, the notion of using tariffs as a bargaining tool; and of promoting tax cuts, especially for high earners and corporations, as a way to turbocharge economic growth. In the days after the election, Elon Musk, who advocates a shock-and-awe approach to everything, lobbied for Howard Lutnick , CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, as his choice for Treasury secretary. Lutnick, Musk argued, would come in determined to shake things up and, if necessary, to burn things down. The world’s richest man took to X to mock Bessent , by contrast, for being a “business-as-usual” figure. Bessent built his own case more subtly, by penning an opinion piece for Fox News’ s web edition, in which he touted the benefits of tariffs, Trump’s go-to solution for the U.S.’s economic woes. The strategy worked. In choosing Bessent over Lutnick, Trump sent a signal that there is a limit to Musk’s influence; that there are things that even the world’s richest man — who bought and flattered his way to a position in Trumpland that looked almost like a co-presidency in the two weeks after the election — can’t force Trump’s hand on. By all accounts, Bessent views tariffs as a negotiating tool rather than a central pillar of his political ideology. Used carefully and selectively, he has argued, tariffs can benefit U.S. businesses and political interests without unleashing unacceptably high inflation . In that sense, he may serve as a moderating influence on Trump, who has indicated he wants to use them as expansively as possible as a way to build up a protective wall around U.S. industry, and who seems willing, even eager, to unleash endless trade wars and international political crises in that pursuit. On other issues, however, Bessent seems ready to march in lockstep with Trump. On tax cuts, for example, he has come out as a firm supporter of making permanent the hugely expensive cuts passed by Congress, at Trump’s urging, in 2017 — cuts that seem certain to balloon the U.S. deficit even further. He also hasn’t been averse to shedding his debonair Wall Street persona when politically expedient and resorting to the sorts of personal attacks that Trump so routinely indulges in. As the election neared, Bessent lobbed insults Harris’s way, calling her an “economic illiterate,” and aggressively defending Trump’s economic priorities. Bessent also came out in favor of eliminating taxes on overtime, on Social Security and on tips. These Trump priorities are populist, and come off as easy, pain-free ways to channel more money to economically vulnerable individuals. But, as Bessent surely knows, fundamentally they’re a gimmick: In removing large amounts of money from the tax pool, they make it harder to fund vital social programs; taxing higher-income Social Security recipients, for example, helps shore up both the Social Security system and also Medicare . And in eliminating taxes on tipped income, the political pressure is lessened to increase the minimum wage, which would, in the long run, deliver far more bang-for-the-buck to low-income workers. These gimmicky political moves won’t crash the economy. But nor will they deliver a long-term economic boost to blue-collar workers and retirees. There’s no doubt that Bessent is an extremely smart financier, a man who has not just played the game of high-stakes investments for decades, but has also carefully studied economic history, and the interplay between economic and political trends over the centuries. As a shaper of national economic policies, he will probably be less likely to trigger massive economic chaos than would some of the more ideological chaos mavens circling for influence in Trumpland. There’s also little reason to think that he, personally, is a political extremist in the vein of the MAGA movement. At the same time, however, there isn’t evidence to suggest that he will risk his position to push back against the coming administration’s extremist policies. Trump appears to be bringing Bessent on to bring respectability to his agenda with Wall Street. But anyone hoping that this somehow means that the rougher and crueler edges of Trumpism have somehow been smoothed out will likely get a rude awakening come January 20.
“Trump is going to create the conditions for another depression,” one critic of the move said. President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team is looking at ways to either reform, reorganize or completely eliminate the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a federal agency that provides insurance for banks to ensure that customers’ money can be recovered in the case of a bank closure. Any changes to the FDIC, an independent agency created in the Great Depression era that insures banking customers’ deposits, would be controversial, to say the least. Citing sources familiar with these discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported last week that individuals seeking to be part of the incoming administration are being asked by the Trump transition team and members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) task force if they believe the FDIC can be changed in some manner. Individuals under consideration for roles within the agency itself, as well as in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, are also being asked “if deposit insurance could be absorbed into the Treasury Department” after eliminating the agency, the report noted . While these questions are being asked of potential executive branch members, any changes to the FDIC would need to be made by a legislative act in Congress. It’s unclear why the Trump team would want to dismantle or change the FDIC in any way. It’s possible these questions are being asked because of Elon Musk’s support for cryptocurrency, which the FDIC has warned in the past can be risky for banks to work with . Any of the changes to the agency that are being discussed could have a detrimental effect on customers’ confidence in the banking system. The FDIC insures customers’ accounts up to $250,000 in their deposits . The agency is a self-sustaining entity, operating on funds derived from insurance premiums from deposits held by banks involved in the program. Before the agency’s creation, customer accounts at banks were at risk of being wiped out completely when a bank failed, which happened frequently during nationwide bank runs in the early 1930s. After imposing a weeklong national “bank holiday” in response to the crisis in 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt and Congress passed the Emergency Banking Act , which established new rules for banks to reopen and enacted greater regulations on them afterward. In June of that same year, another law was passed establishing the FDIC . After The Wall Street Journal report was published, several commentators on social media expressed their concern and incredulity that the Trump transition team was considering ending the agency. “Make no mistake: The goal of Trump’s second term is to enrich Wall Street. Everyone else will be left behind,” former Labor Secretary Robert Reich wrote in response . “FDR created the FDIC amid The Great Depression in order to restore faith in American banking. People were basically losing everything when their banks failed,” journalist Walker Bragman noted in a Bluesky thread . “If he’s successful in doing what he wants to do — or what his team wants to do — Trump is going to create the conditions for another depression.” Former FDIC chair Sheila Bair, who has also worked in the Treasury Department, provided a unique perspective of both institutions in posts on X. “Eliminating the FDIC is so out there, not sure it needs response,” Bair wrote , adding : would not be a good home for deposit insurance. Deposit insurance is funded by bank premiums, not taxpayers. Treasury has no expertise in handling bank failures.
Trump vowed to “not cut one penny” from Social Security, but his other statements and actions suggest that he plans to. On Sunday, president-elect Donald Trump sought to assuage concerns that he will make cuts to Social Security and other safety net programs after Republicans signaled last week that Social Security could be targeted by Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) initiative, managed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Asked by host Kristen Welker on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program whether the DOGE initiative would include cuts to Social Security, Trump said “no,” other than perhaps cuts related to allegations of “abuse” or “fraud” associated with the program. Notably, such fraud happens at extremely low rates — by one estimate, fraud equals around just $0.40 out of every $100 in benefits Social Security doles out yearly . “We’re not touching Social Security, other than — we might make it more efficient,” Trump said about the national insurance program that helps retirees, disabled people, widowers and children of deceased parents. “But the people are going to get what they get.” “We’re not raising ages or any of that stuff,” he added. Trump’s comments echo talking points from his “Agenda 47” platform during his presidential campaign, which stated that he would “not cut one penny from Medicare or Social Security.” However, he and his allies have repeatedly suggested that cuts to both programs are possible. Musk and Ramaswamy have made it evident that cuts to Social Security will be considered. After the two met with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill last week about the DOGE initiative, House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana) said they had expressed sentiments that contradicted Trump’s comments on Sunday. “Nothing is sacrosanct. Nothing. They’re going to put everything on the table,” Scalise told reporters after the meeting , with Fox Business elaborating that cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid would be discussed. In September, when the idea of DOGE was first being discussed, vice president-elect J.D. Vance also indicated that there could be cuts to Social Security. A DOGE-type commission is “going to look much different in, say, the Department of Defense versus Social Security,” Vance said during a podcast interview , insinuating that cuts were going to be considered for the latter agency. In March, Trump himself said that cuts to the program were a possibility. “There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements — in terms of cutting — and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,” Trump said in a statement starkly different from his comments over the past weekend. Perhaps most importantly, Trump attempted to make drastic cuts to Social Security and other programs in his first term as president. In one of his later proposed budgets (which didn’t go on to pass in the then-Democratic-controlled Congress), the president-elect sought to cut Social Security by $25 billion — despite promising in the 2016 presidential campaign that he wouldn’t make any cuts to the agency, just as he promised this last election cycle. Polling consistently shows that Social Security is widely popular and that most American voters would oppose cuts to the program. An AP/NORC poll from 2023 , for example, found that nearly 8 in 10 voters (79 percent) oppose slashing benefits to the program in order to deal with potential funding problems. Instead, most voters (58 percent) would like to see the wealthiest Americans contribute more in taxpayer funds to Social Security.
Driven by massive inequality, the world’s richest grew their fortune from $6.3 trillion to $14 trillion. Driven largely by the accumulation of massive wealth by the richest people in the United States, the Swiss wealth manager UBS said Thursday the assets of billionaires around the world more than doubled over the past decade. Between 2015-24, the total wealth of billionaires increased by 121%, from $6.3 trillion to $14 trillion. Meanwhile, the MSCI AC World Index of global equities, which measures the performance of more than 3,000 stocks from both developed and emerging markets, rose by 73%. The planet’s total gross domestic product is about $105.4 trillion, with a population of just over 8 billion, underscoring the extreme concentration of wealth among the very richest people. The number of billionaires rose from 1,757 to 2,682 over the past decade, while the wealthiest people in the world boasted significant gains over just the past year. Billionaires’ wealth jumped by about 17% in 2024, with the accumulation of wealth among the richest people in the U.S. offsetting a decline in China. U.S. billionaires amassed wealth gains that were 27.6% higher than the previous year, accumulating a total of $5.8 trillion — more than 40% of international billionaire wealth. The tax cuts pushed through by President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in 2017 are still in effect in the U.S. Tax policy analysts have found that the law was skewed to the rich, with households in the top 1% of incomes expecting to receive an average tax cut of more than $60,000 in 2025 compared to an average tax cut of less than $500 for people in the bottom 60%. As Common Dreams reported this week, the top 12 U.S. billionaires now control $2 trillion. The wealth of the four richest people in the U.S. — Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — has hit $1 trillion. “These four men were worth $74 billion 12 short years ago,” said Americans for Tax Fairness. “Tax billionaires.” At the G20 Summit last month, world leaders agreed to “engage cooperatively to ensure that ultra-high-net-worth individuals are effectively taxed.”
A total of 14 billionaires will be in the Trump White House, a number that could go up depending on future appointments. New Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings from Elon Musk show that he spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars of his own money in order to help Donald Trump win the 2024 election — and provided a significant amount of funding to a political action committee (PAC) whose sole aim was to deceive voters. The bulk of Musk’s spending was for America PAC, his own super PAC that engaged in text-messaging efforts to get out the vote, funded other canvassing efforts, and spent heavily on digital advertising in support of Trump. The PAC was also responsible for Musk’s $1 million daily giveaway scheme, which implored people to register to vote and to sign a petition he made in support of conservative ideals. Despite Musk insinuating that winners of the giveaway would be selected at random — similarly to a lottery — winners were chosen based on who Musk’s team thought would be an effective right-wing spokesperson. Musk also invested $20.5 million into an organization called RBG PAC , a group that aimed to mislead voters on Trump’s views on abortion rights, errantly suggesting they were similar to those of late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Clara Spera, Ginsburg’s granddaughter, called the messaging from that PAC “nothing short of appalling,” as Trump’s three appointments to the Supreme Court — including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who replaced Ginsburg shortly after her passing — hold anti-abortion views. All of the money that PAC received came from Musk’s single donation, NBC News reported . In response to the news of Musk’s huge expenditures in the 2024 race, journalist Michelangelo Signorile said that the billionaire will undoubtedly see benefits from his investment in getting Trump elected. Musk “pretty much owns Trump and the GOP and they will give him everything he wants,” Signorile wrote on Bluesky . Indeed, Musk is poised to play a role in the Trump administration. Along with Vivek Ramaswamy, Musk is set to lead the yet-to-be-officially-formed “Department of Government Efficiency,” which will ostensibly seek to cut government waste and increase efficiency within federal bureaucracies. Musk’s stated goal of gutting the federal government by $2 trillion, however, will unquestionably lead to cuts for programs millions of Americans depend on — including likely some popular safety net programs like Social Security . Musk has warned that there may be “economic hardship” for people who will be negatively affected by his project’s cuts. Notably, Musk will not be the only billionaire within the Trump administration — in fact, it appears that, if all of Trump’s nominations and appointments go through, the Trump White House will feature 14 billionaires in cabinet or other advisory roles (including Trump himself), with the possibility of more appointments to the ultra-rich yet to be made in the coming days. The combined net worth of Trump’s nominees is an astonishing $340 billion , showcasing the oligarchic nature of his incoming administration. For comparison, an analysis of President Joe Biden’s cabinet found that they were worth a combined $118 million . David Sirota, founder and editor-in-chief of The Lever , noted that billionaires want to serve in the Trump administration for selfish reasons. “Elon Musk could be in a job where he could shape the government to enrich the companies that Elon Musk owns,” Sirota said last month, following Trump’s win . “This is what money in politics really is. It is an investment. And the investors, the donors, like billionaires, are looking for a return on their investment. That’s what this is, a business strategy.”
The CFPB will distribute $1.8 billion to those charged illegal junk fees or defrauded by credit repair companies. In the coming weeks, as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term approaches and his pledge to dismantle key agencies potentially comes closer to fruition, 4.3 million consumers are set to receive checks from one of the agencies the incoming administration wants to “delete.” The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced Thursday that it will soon begin distributing a historic $1.8 billion to millions of people who were charged illegal junk fees or defrauded by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com. The money will be distributed from the CFPB’s victim relief fund, which was created by Congress and is financed entirely by civil penalties paid by companies and individuals who violate consumer financial protection laws. The fund has distributed $3.3 billion to consumers since its inception, and the CFPB said the forthcoming payment will be its largest ever. “Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com exploited vulnerable consumers who were trying to rebuild their credit, charging them illegal junk fees for results they hadn’t delivered,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “This historic distribution of $1.8 billion demonstrates the CFPB’s commitment to making consumers whole.” A district court ruled in August 2023 that the two companies had violated the Telemarketing Sales Rule’s prohibition on advance fees, which bars credit repair firms from collecting fees from consumers until they prove they have achieved the results they promise to their customers. If the CFPB payments are divided equally among those who were wrongly charged fees by the two companies, each consumer would receive about $419. The payments are being sent days after the CFPB proposed a rule aimed at reining in data brokers who sell people’s personal information. As Common Dreams reported , billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has expressed concern about the practices of data brokers — but as Trump’s nominee to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a yet-to-be-created commission that would cut regulations and government spending, Musk has pledged to “delete” the CFPB. Filmmaker and media activist Danny Ledonne said Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, another businessman nominated to lead DOGE, likely want to do away with the CFPB because the agency acts “in the interest of regular people.” The CFPB is far and away one of the best government agencies acting in the interest of regular people, which is surely why wealthy elites like Musk and Vivek want to eliminate it. pic.twitter.com/sH33P50He1 Liz Zelnick, director of the Economic Security and Corporate Power Program at government watchdog Accountable.US, said the upcoming $1.8 billion payout shows why the CFPB should remain in operation. “When the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is allowed to fully do its job, Americans only stand to benefit,” said Zelnick. “Between surprise fees and misleading business practices, today’s victory affirms the importance of the CFPB for defending people across the country from shady industry actors.” Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) said supporters of consumer protections in Congress will “fight any attempts to dismantle , whether from Trump, Musk, or their billionaire buddies.” “The CFPB fights for everyday Americans against corporate greed, junk fees, and predatory lenders,” he said. “This watchdog agency protects normal people like you and me.”
Bluesky became an alternative to X, formerly known as Twitter, after the 2024 election. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive representing parts of the Queens and Bronx boroughs of New York City, became the first user on the social media site Bluesky to reach 1 million followers earlier this week. Bluesky has been around since the fall of 2021. However, it wasn’t until last month that the site gained popularity as an alternative to X, formerly known as Twitter. Many users shifted platforms due to their disdain for billionaire Elon Musk, who owns X and was a major supporter of Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential race. After Trump’s win in November, many liberal and left-leaning X users sought different options for social media , citing the fact that X has become overrun with hateful, far right accounts as a result of lax regulation under Musk. Ocasio-Cortez was among those who started a Bluesky account after Trump’s win. In a post currently pinned to the top of her feed, the New York lawmaker explained why she prefers Bluesky to X. “A thing I like here is it’s okay to have moments of happiness in public without being broadly scolded, and I believe that sustaining this kind of humanity will be very important as we resist fascism,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote in the post . “We have to sustain each other. Making joy isn’t denial, it’s how we will survive.” While Ocasio-Cortez’s X account is still popular and somewhat active, it is often the target of ridicule and attacks from right-wing accounts. In a recent post remarking on her achievement of 1 million followers, Ocasio-Cortez expounded upon why she made the shift. “People are leaving Twitter because it’s not fun anymore and no one is obligated to be on a platform they don’t enjoy. It’s not rocket science,” she said . Since the exodus of users from X to Bluesky over the past month, the latter site has amassed more than 24 million new accounts . Some faithful users of X and other commentators have claimed that the new site is nothing more than an echo chamber where liberal and left-leaning users only discuss ideas among themselves — but media journalist Parker Molloy has contested that critique. “I think that our default view of social media has become one where insults have become the default, where interactions are a form of combat, and there’s an expectation that being online means bracing yourself for hostility at every turn,” Molloy wrote last month . “Bluesky challenges that norm, not by shutting out opposing views, but by creating a space where conversations aren’t immediately derailed by harassment or bad-faith arguments.” “It’s not about avoiding disagreement — it’s about fostering an environment where disagreements can actually happen productively,” Molloy added. Ocasio-Cortez made headlines for another reason this week: She’s reportedly mulling a run for the top Democratic spot on the House Oversight Committee , which is tasked with ensuring “the efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of the federal government and all its agencies.” As the ranking member of the committee, Ocasio-Cortez would be a leading voice against Republicans and the Trump administration in their attempts to use the government to go after their perceived political enemies. “I’ll be making a decision shortly,” Ocasio-Cortez said .
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has often incensed the nation’s most powerful financial entities. Elon Musk on Wednesday called for the elimination of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that was founded in 2010 with a broad mandate to protect Americans from unfair and predatory financial practices. “Delete CFPB,” Musk wrote in an X post Wednesday morning, calling the Federal Reserve-funded agency an example of “too many duplicative regulatory agencies” in the federal government. That reasoning has been questioned by numerous experts, who note that the CFPB was founded precisely because none of the overlapping financial watchdogs at the time focused on consumer protection. “But there’s no reason to think facts or evidence have anything to do with Musk’s views,” Robert Weissman, co-president of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said in a statement . “Asking the world’s richest person, with a direct interest in a wide range of business lines, to run a project to review the federal government’s overall operations is absurd and fundamentally corrupt — and this issue highlights exactly why.” Musk’s opinions on government reorganization carry more weight now that he has been appointed co-leader of the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” by President-elect Donald Trump with a charge to cut federal spending across the board — with as little input from Congress as possible. The billionaire owner of SpaceX did not specify why he objects to the CFPB, but it has often incensed the nation’s most powerful banks, credit unions, debt collectors and other financial entities. And Musk takes advice from other wealthy members of Trump’s circle like venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who earlier this week accused the CFPB of “terrorizing financial institutions” in an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast . Andreessen’s firm has supported a number of technology companies that have run afoul of the CFPB, including a LendUp Loans, which the agency shuttered in 2021 on the grounds that it misled customers about its loan policy and overcharged military service members. The CFPB distributed nearly $40 million to consumers who had borrowed from that company. That’s a fraction of the $19.6 billion in compensation, canceled debts and other kinds of relief that the CFPB has secured since its founding in wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Under President Joe Biden, CFPB director Rohit Chopra has issued rules that would require banks to give consumers their financial data free of charge, shield consumers from medical debt and limit overdraft fees. Last week, the agency finalized a rule to scrutinize tech companies dealing with digital funds, a business where Musk is expanding his own footprint. In response to CFPB oversight, many large companies have sued the agency, complaining that it had exceeded its legal authority. Musk’s desire to eliminate the CFPB echoes calls by Trump’s former aides who were involved with the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. But even if Musk fails in this objective, Trump has other ways to render the CFPB impotent. Many of his top aides are looking for candidates to lead the agency that would rescind recent rules, cancel investigations and soften its enforcement. During Trump’s first term, the CFPB under then-interim Director Mick Mulvaney, struck down rules targeting payday lenders, cancelled a number of lawsuits and requested a budget of zero dollars from the Federal Reserve.
Georgia GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has implied that her role will include implementing aspects of Project 2025. Within the next congressional term, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Georgia) has said that she will lead a House subcommittee on “government efficiency,” coordinating with the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” project that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will run under the incoming Trump administration. Both the agency and the subcommittee — set to be called the “Delivering on Government Efficiency” subcommittee, which will operate within the purview of the House Oversight Committee — will share the “DOGE” initials, a reference to a cryptocurrency product that Musk once promoted. A GOP source with knowledge of the subcommittee’s creation told The Hill that it will be tasked with “investigating wasteful spending, examining ways to reorganize federal agencies to improve efficiency, and identifying solutions to eliminate bureaucratic red tape.” Greene confirmed her designation as the head of the future subcommittee on social media, and suggested that her background in business made her a good fit for the role. She also said that her goals would include firing supposed “bad employees” within the federal government — alluding to complaints made by president-elect Donald Trump about workers who are disloyal to him. “In the private sector, if you’re not doing a good job, you get fired. But for some reason, in government, bad employees — whether they’re failing to do the job they were hired to do or working in roles that are no longer needed — never get fired,” Greene claimed in a social media post announcing her new assignment . Greene’s complaints are exaggerated, as federal government employees can, in fact, be fired for poor performance. It is more likely that Greene’s grievances (as well as those from Trump and other Republicans) are over the process of termination for federal roles, as workers are given due process to ensure that their firings are because they are incompetent at their jobs, rather than for political reasons. Responding to the news that Greene would be leading the subcommittee, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) suggested that Greene’s incompetence would actually be a positive thing for people concerned about how far the “government efficiency” project might go. “This is good, actually. She barely shows up and doesn’t do the reading,” Ocasio-Cortez said of Greene’s performance in Congress . “To borrow a phrase I saw elsewhere, it’s like giving someone an unplugged controller.” “Absolutely dying at those two now getting assigned the ‘privilege’ of ‘working’ with MTG,” Ocasio-Cortez added . “That is actually hilarious. Enjoy, fellas!” Greene’s statements about workers imply that she and other Republicans will implement a major part of Project 2025 under a Trump White House — the elimination of civil service protections for federal workers , allowing Trump to fire employees without cause or due process. During his first term in office, Trump lamented how such employees supposedly undermined his far right agenda, making baseless claims that they were part of a “deep state” conspiracy working on behalf of Democrats. During his presidential campaign, Trump tried to distance himself from the unpopular Project 2025, but his campaign promoted elements of the far right manifesto, including eliminating workers’ protections. Trump’s “Agenda 47,” for instance, states that he will issue an “executive order restoring the president’s authority to fire rogue bureaucrats” — in other words, government employees who, in the course of their work, may perform functions that he disagrees with. The “government efficiency” agenda that Greene, Ramaswamy and Musk will undertake may also threaten Americans in other ways, including by dismantling social safety net programs. While discussing what a government efficiency commission might look like, now-vice president-elect J.D. Vance indicated on the campaign trail that no program was off limits. “It’s going to look much different in, say, the Department of Defense versus Social Security,” Vance said in September , indicating that Musk and his crew would examine ways to cut Social Security. Musk’s selection to lead the commission is itself problematic, as he is an untrustworthy figure who has peddled false conspiracy theories. Since his purchase of Twitter (and its transition into “X”), Musk has allowed the platform to become a bastion of far right, extremist viewpoints — and despite his claims that he’s a “free speech absolutist,” numerous progressive voices and journalists have been censored on the platform. Musk himself has repeatedly peddled extremist views, including antisemitic beliefs. He has, for example, boosted posts denying the true cause of the Nazi Holocaust , and has published racist content alleging that most migrants coming to the U.S. are “criminals,” a claim that has been thoroughly debunked . Ironically, Musk’s own AI program on X has recognized him as a purveyor of falsehoods — one of the worst offenders, in fact, on the platform. “Based on various analyses, social media sentiment, and reports, Elon Musk has been identified as one of the most significant spreaders of misinformation on X since he acquired the platform,” the AI program said in a post , adding, “Musk has made numerous posts that have been criticized for promoting or endorsing misinformation, especially related to political events, elections, health issues like COVID-19, and conspiracy theories.”
They call for the mass firing of federal employees, large-scale deregulation and spending cuts to anti-poverty programs. The two right-wing billionaires President-elect Donald Trump has tasked with spearheading a new “government efficiency” commission outlined their vision Wednesday for the mass firing of federal employees, large-scale deregulation, and major spending cuts that could impact antipoverty programs, drug research and development, and more. For the first time since Trump announced plans to create the Department on Government Efficiency (DOGE) — which, despite its name, would be an advisory commission rather than an actual federal department — Tesla CEO Elon Musk and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy offered a detailed look at how they plan to achieve their stated objective of taking a “ chainsaw ” to federal operations. “We are assisting the Trump transition team to identify and hire a lean team of small-government crusaders, including some of the sharpest technical and legal minds in America,” the pair wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal . “The two of us will advise DOGE at every step to pursue three major kinds of reform: regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions, and cost savings. We will focus particularly on driving change through executive action based on existing legislation rather than by passing new laws.” Decrying rules crafted by “unelected bureaucrats,” Musk and Ramaswamy — unelected outside advisers — wrote that they intend to present to Trump “a list of regulations” they believe should be eliminated. The culling of regulations would, they argued, provide the justification for “mass headcount reductions” — corporate-speak for sweeping firings — across federal agencies, a plan the two wrote would not be deterred by civil service protections. Watchdogs have noted that the regulatory cuts envisioned by the commission’s co-leaders would likely benefit Musk’s companies, at least three of which are currently under scrutiny from nine federal agencies. “Based on Elon Musk’s comments, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency is poised to make far-reaching recommendations that could have a devastating impact on Americans and enormously benefit insiders, starting with Musk himself,” Public Citizen co-president Robert Weissman said Wednesday. Musk and Ramaswamy also laid out a plan under which Trump would evade existing federal statutes such as the Impoundment Control Act to cut spending already allocated by Congress. “DOGE will help end federal overspending by taking aim at the $500 billion-plus in annual federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended, from $535 million a year to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and $1.5 billion for grants to international organizations to nearly $300 million to progressive groups like Planned Parenthood,” they wrote. As The Washington Post ’s Jacob Bogage recently observed , the federal programs “without separate spending authorization” that Musk and Ramaswamy are targeting “represent more than $516 billion” and encompass key areas including veterans’ healthcare, education spending, housing assistance, childcare aid, student loan programs, Head Start, opioid addiction treatment, and NASA. Musk, a megadonor to Trump’s 2024 presidential bid, claimed on the campaign trail that he would be able to identify “ at least $2 trillion ” in possible cuts to federal spending. Casey Wetherbee, an Argentina-based writer, warned Wednesday that “Musk and Ramaswamy’s admiration of Argentine president Javier Milei offers us a glimpse into their ideal end state.” “Ramaswamy tweeted on November 18: ‘A reasonable formula to fix the U.S. government: Milei-style cuts, on steroids,'” Wetherbee wrote for Jacobin . “When Milei assumed office last year, he declared that conditions would worsen before things would get better; Musk similarly warned that DOGE’s recommendations may cause ‘temporary hardship.’ Meanwhile, in Argentina, Milei’s austerity measures have targeted the country’s social safety net, causing the poverty rate to skyrocket while only lowering taxes for the country’s wealthiest citizens, a troubling outlook for a second Trump administration if DOGE’s advice is ever implemented.” “A second Trump term will undoubtedly see a multipronged attack on any institution that seeks to constrain big business, and DOGE will lead the charge,” Wetherbee added. “After all, in DOGE’s public call for collaborators, it seeks ‘super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries’; that’s how they see themselves. We can only hope that, by virtue of how evidently insufferable they are, DOGE’s relationship with the Trump administration flames out spectacularly.”
Trump’s cabinet picks set the stage for corporations to run roughshod over the US public amid rampant deregulation. Over the last two weeks, president-elect Donald Trump has rolled out the names of those who he hopes will staff top federal agencies in his incoming administration. While Trump’s first administration was led by a blend of longtime Washington insiders and less traditional picks for Cabinet spots, this term Trump appears ready to buck conventional wisdom entirely. The slate of nominees for his second administration includes people from different spheres of public life, but his picks all share two main qualities in common: they have professed complete loyalty to Trump, and they share Trump’s aim of completely undermining the regulatory and oversight functions of the federal government. Nowhere is this philosophy better embodied than in Trump’s proposal to create a new federal agency, the Department of Government Efficient (DOGE), headed by billionaire Elon Musk and near-billionaire (and former Republican presidential candidate) Vivek Ramaswamy. Beneath the agency’s cringey name, a nod to Elon Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency , lurks a scorched-earth philosophy concerned with cutting vast swaths of the federal government to the bone. Trump has promised that the department will “ restructure federal agencies ,” an ominous sentiment from an incoming president who has also long expressed his desire to reschedule huge numbers of civil servants , making them easier to fire. Taken together, these moves make it clear that Trump, with the help of Musk and Ramaswamy, intends to make profound changes to the size and ambit of the federal bureaucracy. In practice, this could herald massive cuts to the regulatory apparatus of the federal government, making it easier for people like Musk and Ramaswamy (who was a pharmaceuticals entrepreneur before getting involved in politics) to run their business ventures without worrying about pesky government oversight. If that is indeed the thrust of DOGE policymaking, it would continue a trend from the first Trump administration of favoring policy friendly to big business while paying lip service to working class concerns. It would also closely align with the road map laid out in Project 2025 , the Heritage Foundation’s sweeping playbook for right-wing policy making, whose architects Trump is closely allied with, but which Trump strategically sought to distance himself from during the campaign. Arguably, as head-turning as Trump’s DOGE salvo is his decision to nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the third-party presidential candidate who dropped out of the race to endorse him, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Early in his career, Kennedy built a reputation as a progressive lawyer focused on environmental causes , but he has more recently become well known for his vociferous vaccine skepticism . Kennedy’s anti-vax crusade has already had horrendous consequences, including in Samoa, where Kennedy had helped spread vaccine misinformation. A measles outbreak there in 2019 killed 83 people, many of them children. If Kennedy is allowed to scale his vaccine misinformation output to a national level, it could have horrific consequences for huge parts of the country. Kennedy, who has no background in medicine or public health, has already made a series of promises that have alarmed the medical community. HHS, via the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), oversees approval of new drugs and vaccines, a function of the agency that Kennedy has specifically targeted. A conspiracy theory-peddling group he founded, Children’s Health Defense, attempted to stop the FDA’s approval of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. Kennedy has also accused the FDA of suppressing evidence of the efficacy of pseudoscientific health treatments like raw milk and stem cells. Kennedy’s obvious disdain for FDA regulations could result in a complete tear-down of that department if he takes the reins at HHS as planned. Kennedy’s assaults on pharmaceutical companies, though, have put him at odds with one of the largest industries in the U.S. While many of Trump’s policy aims, if realized, are sure to facilitate record profits for the corporate class, Kennedy’s anti-pharma attitude has already impacted that sector. If Trump is unable to tolerate the tension between one of his appointees and the corporate world, Kennedy, despite his public displays of loyalty to Trump, may be headed for an early exit from Trump’s second administration. Another political figure reaping the rewards of her longstanding support for Trump is South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. Noem, once widely considered to be a top candidate for Trump’s running mate this year, has been nominated to lead the Department of Homeland Security. As the head of the Department of Homeland Security, Noem, if confirmed, would play a central role in carrying out Trump’s campaign promise to deport millions of undocumented people living in the U.S. She’ll work closely with Trump senior aides Stephen Miller and Tom Homan — both extreme immigration hawks, one of whom was responsible for the controversial and cruel practice of family separation that came to define Trump’s immigration policy in his first term. Noem, who established her right-wing bona fides by flagrantly ignoring COVID-19 regulations as governor of South Dakota, does not have a background in border security , nor does she have any notable experience working with immigrants. In fact, just 4 percent of South Dakota’s population are immigrants — the state ranks near the bottom of all U.S. states in terms of both the percentage and real number of immigrants who live there. Noem’s appointment, then, appears to turn primarily on a quality that the incoming president has rewarded time and again: fealty to Trump. Noem has stayed close to Trump’s orbit during his four years in exile from the presidency, primarily through her ties — rumored to be romantic as well as professional — to former Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski. Noem was a vocal backer of Trump during his second presidential primary run, and it seems that her steadfast loyalty is now paying off. Noem has been vocally supportive of Trump’s rhetoric on immigration, and, with other Republican governors, sent troops to Texas to assist in an effort to discourage migration at the southern border. In Noem, Trump has found a faithful acolyte for this role. With her, as well as Miller and Homan in place, Trump is unlikely to meet much resistance if he decides to push forward with his plan to mobilize a mass deportation effort on a scale hitherto unseen in the U.S.’s history. Then, of course, there is Trump’s nomination of the volatile former congressman, Matt Gaetz, to serve as attorney general. Gaetz’s nomination has struck a profoundly dissonant chord, largely because he was recently under investigation over allegations that he had violated sex trafficking laws and over allegations that “Gaetz and onetime political ally Joel Greenberg paid underage girls and escorts or offered them gifts in exchange for sex,” as reported by The Associated Press . Members of the House Ethics Committee, which was investigating Gaetz before he abruptly resigned from Congress, are currently at loggerheads over whether to release a report they had compiled. The report is said to contain damning details concerning Gaetz having sex with a minor. Gaetz, a career politician from a political family , only passed the bar a few years before he first was elected to public office. Attorneys general are typically members of the legal profession with decades of experience; even Trump’s own appointees to the position in his first term fit that bill. This term, Trump has made no bones about his desire to gut the Justice Department, which he has accused of becoming politicized and partisan against him and his allies. Gaetz, an avowed Trump loyalist , appears to be the person who Trump believes is right for the slash-and-burn approach he desires at the Department of Justice. In addition to nominating these big-name controversial and incongruous picks for domestic-facing posts in his administration, Trump has also nominated a comparatively sober group of institutionalists who are attracting less attention but are no less committed to disassembling the regulatory capacity of the federal government. For example, Trump has nominated Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, to lead the Department of Energy. Wright is a fossil fuel hardliner who has denied the reality of climate change , and has been lauded by some Republicans for “ the foundation for America’s fracking boom.” Liberty Energy itself focuses on fracking within the U.S. and North America and would certainly benefit from a rollback of some of the modest drilling regulations put in place under President Joe Biden. In a statement revealing his pick for energy secretary, Trump foreshadowed Wright’s role in “ cutting red tape ,” and this will almost certainly be the focus of his tenure at the Energy Department: stripping and gutting any regulations seen to be impeding unfettered production of fossil fuels on U.S. soil. Meanwhile, Trump has named Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor who once ran against him in the Republican presidential primary, to head the Department of Interior. In that role, Burgum will oversee management of public lands , a position from which he can play a complementary role in Wright’s quest to open public lands for oil and gas drilling. Burgum is another billionaire appointee to Trump’s cabinet who made his fortune as a tech entrepreneur before entering politics. He opposes Biden’s reduction of oil and gas drilling on public lands and has been an ardent promoter of fossil fuels, especially as governor of a state where oil drilling is a major industry. Together, Wright and Burgum could unleash a domestic drilling bonanza, accelerating a trend that has already been picking up speed during Biden’s presidency. With Trump’s enthusiastic support, his administration could oversee a shift towards even more reliance on fossil fuels for domestic energy needs. The U.S. is already on track to miss its emissions reduction goal per the Paris climate agreement — an agreement that Trump will likely exit again, as he did in his first term — and a renewed emphasis on fossil fuel production would put the U.S. on a trajectory to grossly undershoot even the most conservative emissions reduction goals. As always, Senate confirmation is required before anyone can officially become part of the administration. Some Republican senators have already voiced doubts about a number of these nominees, and it’s possible that not all will end up finding a place in the Trump White House. Gaetz in particular may face a steep path to appointment, with reported skepticism from within his own party. Regardless of who ultimately fills these positions, though, it is already clear what Trump intends to do in his second term: fundamentally shrink the federal government’s capacity to regulate corporations, while simultaneously expanding its control over the lives of working people.
Musk will head the so-called Department of Government Efficiency alongside biotech billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy. President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that Elon Musk — the world’s richest man, a megadonor to the Republican’s campaign, and a beneficiary of government contracts — will co-lead a not-yet-created department tasked with gutting federal regulations and slashing spending. Musk, who leads several companies that are under federal scrutiny , will head the so-called Department of Government Efficiency alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech billionaire . “Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,” Trump declared in a statement , without explaining the funding structure of the commission or how it would achieve those sweeping objectives. Congress, which is likely to be under full Republican control come January, has authority over federal spending. Trump said the commission “will provide advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management & Budget to drive large-scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to Government never seen before.” During the presidential race — into which Musk pumped more than $100 million to boost Trump — the Tesla CEO claimed a government efficiency commission would seek out $2 trillion in spending to eliminate. That sum, as The Washington Post observed , far exceeds the combined budgets of the Pentagon and the Departments of Education and Homeland Security. Musk acknowledged during a virtual town hall event in late October that the massive cuts he hopes to enact would bring “temporary hardship” to ordinary Americans. He has also cast his push to gut federal regulations as an “existential” issue, claiming that “humanity will never reach Mars” unless “we get rid of the mountain of smothering regulations.” “This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in Government waste, which is a lot of people!” Musk said in the Trump team’s statement announcing the commission. Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the watchdog group Public Citizen , said it is “laughable” to put “the ultimate corporate tycoon” in charge of a commission on government spending and regulations. “The purpose of government regulations is to protect the American people,” said Gilbert. “We all depend on these regulations to protect our air, water, workers, children’s safety, and so much more. ‘Cutting red tape’ is shorthand for getting rid of the safeguards that protect us in order to benefit corporate interests. Our problem is corporate capture of so much of our public policy, not this lie that corporations are held back by too many rules.” “Musk not only knows nothing about government efficiency and regulation, his own businesses have regularly run afoul of the very rules he will be in position to attack in his new ‘czar’ position,” Gilbert added. “This is the ultimate corporate corruption. If anyone had any doubts whether the Trump government aims to serve regular people or the billionaires, they should now be resolved.” In a report published in October, Public Citizen found that “at least three of Musk’s businesses are currently under scrutiny for alleged misconduct by at least nine federal agencies.” Since endorsing Trump over the summer, Musk has exerted significant influence over the Republican leader’s political operations, impacting his choice of running mate and injecting his views on candidates for key posts in the incoming administration. The New York Times reported Wednesday that Musk “has sat in on nearly every job interview with the Trump team” and is “trying to install his Silicon Valley friends in plum positions in the next administration.” Musk, whose wealth has surged by tens of billions of dollars since Trump’s victory in last week’s election, has also relentlessly boosted the president-elect on X, the social media platform he purchased in 2022 and transformed into a right-wing disinformation machine . “Get ready this January for chaos, revenge, greed, rampant abuses of power, and the unbridled control of corrupt plutocrats and oligarchs,” legendary consumer advocate Ralph Nader warned over the weekend. “With Elon Musk in the lead.”
Sirota says our elections have become battlegrounds for billionaires who want to see returns on their investments. Image Credit: @america via X In the wake of the reelection of Donald Trump, some of the richest people in the world saw their net worths soar as stock prices rapidly shot up. “What was different about this election was how central billionaires were in the entire political discourse,” says The Lever ’s David Sirota, who joins Democracy Now! to discuss the outsized role of the super-rich in U.S politics, pointing out that both Trump and Kamala Harris campaigned heavily with billionaires, including Elon Musk and Mark Cuban. “These people are not giving money simply out of the goodness of their hearts. They want things. They have policy demands,” Sirota says. “The investors, the donors, like billionaires, are looking for a return on their investment.” Sirota, who previously worked as a communications adviser and speechwriter for the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, also explains how Elon Musk’s influence on Trump’s campaign is a preview of the power he could wield if he ends up appointed to the Trump administration. This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, “War, Peace and the Presidency.” I’m Amy Goodman. As we continue to look at where the Democrats went wrong, we’re joined now by David Sirota, founder and editor-in-chief of The Lever , host of its new investigative podcast Master Plan , his new piece headlined “Election 2024: How Billionaire Avengers Destroyed Democracy.” Those billionaires, David Sirota writes, included Elon Musk, who spent about $120 million to help Trump get elected and saw his net worth soar by over $16 billion after Trump secured victory. Other billionaires campaigned for Kamala Harris, such as Mark Cuban, who was her top TV surrogate, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August. This is a clip. GOV. J.B. PRITZKER: Donald Trump thinks that we should trust him on the economy, because he claims to be very rich. But take it from an actual billionaire, Trump is rich in only one thing: stupidity! AMY GOODMAN: For more on how the Democrats lost the election and what is next, David Sirota joins us from snowy Denver, Colorado. His August piece for The Guardian is headlined “Project 2025 started a half-century ago. A Trump win could solidify it forever.” And David Sirota was also senior communications adviser and speechwriter for Bernie Sanders when he ran for president. Welcome back to Democracy Now! , David. Talk about the billionaires. DAVID SIROTA: Well, look, I think what was different about this election — and to be clear, there’s been billionaires funding elections from the shadows, certainly an upsurge of that since the Citizens United decision. But I think what was different about this election was how central billionaires were in the entire political discourse. I mean, billionaires were on the national stage: Elon Musk, Mark Cuban. You had billionaires like Reid Hoffman, Barry Diller demanding — if Kamala Harris won, demanding the firing of FTC Chair Lina Khan. So, billionaires were really in our face this time in a way that they really haven’t been before. And billionaires, I should mention, were celebrated. That clip that you just played of billionaire Governor J.B. Pritzker and the Democratic convention celebrating billionaires as a credential. And that speech came, by the way, right after Bernie Sanders spoke at the Democratic convention saying we’ve got to essentially reduce the power of billionaires in politics. So, we’ve come a long way — and, in my view, not in a great direction — towards our elections being celebrations of billionaires, our elections being battlegrounds for billionaires to have their fights, to center their issues. And essentially, what ends up happening is, is that the 2024 election, that was supposed to be about saving democracy, was essentially an exercise in destroying what was left of democracy, turning our elections themselves into an open celebration of the oligarchy. And I think if we simply walk away from this election and say, “Hey, the Democrats lost because they didn’t have enough billionaires, and the Republicans won because more billionaire money went to Donald Trump,” and we define our democracy as just a battle of billionaires, then the question is: In the battle to save democracy, what are we actually saving, and for whom? AMY GOODMAN: So, during the presidential campaign, as you just said, two major Democratic donors, media mogul Barry Diller, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, publicly called for Kamala Harris to fire the head of the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, who’s led Biden’s antitrust efforts. Hoffman sits on the board of Microsoft, which was sued by the FTC. He was interviewed on CNN by Jake Tapper. JAKE TAPPER: Thanks for joining us. So, you and other big-money donors are giving money to Vice President Harris, suggesting also that she replace the head of the FTC, which impacts policy and the economy. What do you say to somebody who watches this and says, “This isn’t how American politics should work, rich people getting to buy levels of influence”? REID HOFFMAN: Well, I totally agree with not buying levels of influence. I separate my role as a donor and expert. So, if you asked me as a donor, I say I’m giving money to Kamala Harris because I think she’s the best future president for the U.S., for business, for a bunch of other things. If you ask me as an expert about what, you know, kind of Lina Khan is doing and whether I think she is helping or hurting America relative to your anti-merger policies, which are, you know, mostly to bring litigation, versus, you know, really solidly grounded in kind of what’s going on and what helps American business thrive here and overseas, then I give an expert opinion. But I think donor and expert should be kept separate, and I’ve never tied the two ever, in any conversation anywhere I’ve ever had. AMY GOODMAN: So, that’s billionaire Reid Hoffman, supporter of Kamala Harris. David Sirota, since economy was a top issue, inflation a top issue, if you can talk about what it meant to be against Lina Khan and what she represented, but, most importantly, the power of these billionaires, and not just, of course, on the Democratic side, because the Republican who won, President Trump, he had Elon Musk giving out a million dollars a day to voters? DAVID SIROTA: Look, I think the Lina Khan example is really important, because while Reid Hoffman insists that his money has nothing to do with his policy demands, functionally that’s not the way things work. I mean, Joe Biden back in the 1970s talked about this when he first got elected, about how money always comes with a demand. Money always comes in politics with strings attached. Functionally, the way this works, these people are not giving money simply out of the goodness of their own — of their hearts. They want things. They have policy demands. And I think, as you mentioned, Elon Musk, that’s another great example. I mean, Elon Musk running around, spending big money to help elect Donald Trump, while saying he’s going to accept a job in the Trump administration, Donald Trump saying he’s going to appoint him to a job, a job that would oversee the reshaping of federal spending and the federal budget, at a time when Elon Musk runs companies that are major federal contractors. So, in a sense, Elon Musk could be in a job where he could shape the government to enrich the companies that Elon Musk owns. This is what money in politics really is. It is an investment. And the investors, the donors, like billionaires, are looking for a return on their investment. That’s what this is, a business strategy. AMY GOODMAN: So, let’s talk about what Musk is going to get in return. You report that the Senate Republicans’ scheme to let Trump self-police ethics — “Republicans have been blocking the appointment of the government’s ethics enforcement official until after the election — so that Trump can now appoint,” as you put it, “his own crony who can waive all ethics laws for his new White House.” And then address the issue of Project 2025. DAVID SIROTA: So, the Office of Government Ethics is the independent office that is supposed to enforce anti-corruption rules when it comes to the executive branch. When executive branch officials come into office, the Office of Government Ethics reviews whether they have conflicts of interest in their own holdings, and then will say, “You have to divest from this or that,” if your job is overseeing things that pose a conflict of interest for you. The Republicans — that job has been held open, blocked in the Senate by the Republicans for more than a year, that job kept open. And Senator Mike Lee of Utah has said he wants to keep it open. He said this in a floor speech in the Senate, saying they want to keep it open until after the election, so that if Donald Trump wins, Donald Trump can appoint his own head of the Office of Government Ethics to a five-year term, which, in practice, would allow Trump to hire somebody who he would already know was going to enforce or not enforce this or that ethics laws for incoming executive branch officials. So, would somebody like Elon Musk get a waiver from anti-corruption laws? Would any other billionaire serving in Donald Trump’s Cabinet get those kinds of waivers to allow them to essentially serve in dual roles, owning companies but also running federal agencies that regulate those companies? And as it relates to Project 2025, one of the central tenets of Project 2025 is the initiative to help Trump appoint more political loyalists — in other words, decimating the civil service, the supposedly and supposed to be nonpartisan civil service. Again, when you think about packing the executive branch with Trump loyalists, Trump loyalists who may have financial conflicts of interest, and then consider that Trump will be able to effectively appoint his own person, his own political loyalist, to oversee the enforcement or nonenforcement of anti-corruption and ethics laws, it puts together a situation where people may be coming into the government who are able to use the government to enrich themselves. AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about what Musk and Trump have been promoting, leading a new Department of Government Efficiency, the initials DOGE, or Doge, also referring to that meme coin cryptocurrency that Musk has been promoting? DAVID SIROTA: Yeah, I mean, the best we can tell from what has been described is that Elon Musk is going to head up some kind of commission, potentially with a lot of cross-agency power, to propose and enact a radical reshaping of the federal government, and potentially a radical privatization of government services, government activities. And again, I go back to the fact that Elon Musk runs companies that benefit from government privatization, contractors, SpaceX as the big example. So, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, could be in a position to make recommendations about what government services to privatize, a privatization agenda that could ultimately send more contracts to the companies that Elon Musk owns. AMY GOODMAN: David Sirota, thank you so much for being with us, founder and editor-in-chief of The Lever , host of the new investigative podcast Master Plan . We’ll link to your new piece , “Election 2024: How Billionaire Avengers Destroyed Democracy.” Next up, we go to Amman, Jordan, to speak with Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council. He’s just left Gaza. UNICEF and other groups describe conditions there as “apocalyptic.” Stay with us.
Trump mega-donor Elon Musk saw the largest gains, receiving $26.5 billion the day after the election. The 10 richest people in the world saw their wealth increase by a record margin just one day after former President Donald Trump won the 2024 election, a sign that already wide wealth disparities will likely grow even wider over the next four years due to Trump’s stated economic goals. According to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index , those 10 individuals saw their wealth rise by up to $64 billion on Wednesday. That’s the highest daily increase among the 10 wealthiest people in the world ever seen in a single day since Bloomberg started tracking those people’s worth in 2012. For comparison, the $64 billion figure is equivalent to the annual wages earned by 800,000 American households making the U.S. median income of $80,000 per year. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person (and someone who Trump suggested could play a significant role in his administration ), saw the biggest increase in riches , receiving $26.5 billion the day after the election. Other tech business leaders, like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and others, also saw huge gains in their wealth. Much of the increase was due to a surge in the U.S. stock market after Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, a sign that investors expect his low-tax and deregulation policies to be quickly implemented when he enters office. The stock market, of course, is not a proper indicator of how well the economy is doing, especially for the half of all households in the U.S. whose members do not own any stock, including 401K retirement plans, and are therefore not impacted by positive performances on Wall Street the same way the ultra-rich are. Economists who understand that the gains by the top 10 wealthiest individuals on the planet do not translate well to the rest of the world were quick to point out that the widening of economic disparities were soon to become a regular feature of the incoming Trump administration. “Make no mistake: the ultra-wealthy and Wall Street will make out like bandits during the second Trump term,” former Labor Secretary Robert Reich said on the social media site X. “Everyone else will be left behind.” University of Wisconsin sociology professor Jessica Calarco said it will be important to keep an eye on wealth disparities and how the Trump economy will largely benefit the uber wealthy. “As we try to deduce how we got here, we shouldn’t forget the billionaires who’ve spent decades promoting myths to delude us into accepting inequality and to keep us divided by race, class, gender, religion & politics so we don’t challenge their power,” Calarco wrote on X .
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has alleged that Musk’s daily $1 million giveaway is an illegal lottery. Elon Musk and his political action committee are attempting to move a civil lawsuit — which alleges that Musk’s voter registration “lottery” scheme is unlawful — to federal court rather than the Pennsylvania state court system. Musk’s legal team submitted the filing late Wednesday evening . He was scheduled to appear in Philadelphia County court on Thursday morning, after District Attorney Larry Krasner filed the lawsuit against the billionaire and his America PAC earlier this week. However, federal law requires state courts to delay any further action if a defendant submits a request to move proceedings from state to federal jurisdictions. Musk asserts that the case is not about “state-law claims of nuisance and consumer protection,” but rather has to do with allegations of election “interference.” “While purports to raise only state-law claims relating to public nuisance and consumer protection, DA Krasner’s claims, as evident on the face of the Complaint, turn principally on the allegation that Defendants are somehow unlawfully interfering with a federal election,” Musk’s legal request maintains , suggesting that such questions of legality belong in a federal setting, not a state-based courtroom. It’s unclear how quickly a federal court will react to Musk’s filing, and if an action in the case will happen before Election Day. Musk announced a new winner of his unregulated lottery scheme on Thursday morning. Despite Musk’s legal objections to Krasner’s lawsuit, the district attorney’s complaint is fairly cut-and-dry about the fact that Musk’s lottery appears to be illegal. Pennsylvania law requires every lottery administered in the state to be regulated by state officials. Musk’s lottery — which awards $1 million daily to a registered voter in a swing state, including Pennsylvania, who has signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments to the Constitution — is not regulated in any way. “America PAC and Musk are lulling Philadelphia citizens — and others in the Commonwealth (and other swing states in the upcoming election) — to give up their personal identifying information and make a political pledge in exchange for the chance to win $1 million,” Krasner’s lawsuit stated . “That is a lottery. And it is indisputably an unlawful lottery. Under unambiguous Pennsylvania law, all lotteries in Pennsylvania must be regulated by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” The lawsuit also notes that state law defines illegal lotteries as public “nuisances” and that unregulated schemes like Musk’s are in violation of such laws. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has recognized that Musk’s lottery scheme is likely in violation of federal law , as U.S. statutes forbid anyone from paying or offering to pay “either for registration to vote or for voting,” with steep penalties for individuals or entities that violate those terms. The DOJ, however, has declined to block Musk from continuing his lottery. Election law experts have also said that Musk’s scheme is probably illegal. “When you start limiting prizes or giveaways to only registered voters or only people who have voted, that’s where bribery concerns arise,” said Notre Dame Law School professor Derek Muller .
“All lotteries in Pennsylvania must be regulated” by the state, District Attorney Larry Krasner said in his lawsuit. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner filed a lawsuit on Monday against Elon Musk and his super political action committee (PAC), alleging that their $1 million daily giveaway to registered voters in swing states (including in Pennsylvania) was illegal. Several experts believe that the giveaway, administered by the billionaire’s America PAC, runs afoul of federal election laws . But Krasner’s filing also suggests that it’s in violation of state laws regarding the administering of lotteries. All lotteries in the state, Krasner argued, must be regulated by Pennsylvania officials . Musk’s giveaway was not. Musk’s scheme is asking registered voters to sign a petition that states they agree with the tenets of the First and Second Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. While the lottery doesn’t directly ask people to register to vote, the award is only eligible to those who are registered. Payments can only go to individuals who reside in swing states. In Pennsylvania specifically — a notable swing state with 19 Electoral College votes up for grabs — Musk is also giving every person who is registered to vote and signs the petition $100 . Krasner’s suit against Musk and his PAC forcefully laid out the case for why the giveaway must be stopped : America PAC and Musk are lulling Philadelphia citizens — and others in the Commonwealth (and other swing states in the upcoming election) — to give up their personal identifying information and make a political pledge in exchange for the chance to win $1 million. That is a lottery. And it is indisputably an unlawful lottery. Under unambiguous Pennsylvania law, all lotteries in Pennsylvania must be regulated by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Krasner’s lawsuit says that Musk’s lottery “must be stopped, immediately,” noting that it is a “scheme to influence voters.” A state judge could rule on the matter as soon as this week. Pennsylvania State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta (D) lauded Krasner’s lawsuit for tackling Musk’s daily lottery. “Krasner’s filing makes a serious case that America PAC and Musk hatched an illegal scheme that makes misleading promises to voters while threatening Americans’ right to a free & fair election,” Kenyatta said on X . Musk has insisted that his contest is not based on rewarding people to vote, particularly for Donald Trump, the GOP presidential nominee the billionaire has been stumping hard for on the campaign trail. The Department of Justice (DOJ), however, has warned that Musk’s scheme is likely in violation of federal law — but despite that warning, the DOJ has so far not taken action to address the daily lottery for registered voters. U.S. law forbids anyone from paying or offering to pay “either for registration to vote or for voting,” with the maximum punishment for anyone in violation of that law being either a $10,000 fine, up to five years in prison, or both. Derek Muller, an election law expert and professor at Notre Dame Law School, suggested earlier this month that the scheme by Musk’s America PAC was skirting the limits of election law, particularly because the rules on who qualified to win the $1 million prize were very specific. “When you start limiting prizes or giveaways to only registered voters or only people who have voted, that’s where bribery concerns arise,” Muller said in a social media post . “By limiting a giveaway only to registered voters, it looks like you’re giving cash for voter registration.”
Sanders’s warning comes the same day as the Tesla CEO is scheduled to headline a Trump rally in Madison Square Garden. Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders issued a strong warning against a second Trump administration on Sunday, portraying him as an authoritarian who might let billionaire Elon Musk control his government and would be even worse than the Biden-Harris administration when it comes to enabling Israel’s war on Gaza. Speaking on NBC ’s “Meet the Press,” Sanders agreed that it was accurate to describe former U.S. President Donald Trump as a fascist. “Clearly he has a strong, strong tendency toward authoritarianism, and to undermining American democracy,” Sanders said. Sanders’ remarks came when host Kristen Welker asked him if he agreed with recent statements by Vice President Kamala Harris and former Trump White House Chief of Staff John Kelly that Trump was a fascist. At first, Sanders said he didn’t like to use that phrasing, but when pressed further said, “You can describe him as a fascist.” Sanders emphasized Trump’s role in inciting the January 6, 2021 insurrection to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, and said there was a reason why his former Vice President Mike Pence and former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney would not support his 2024 election bid. “It is because they understand that Trump is an authoritarian, does not believe in the rule of law, and for 100 reasons is unfit to be president of the United States,” Sanders explained.

Sen. @BernieSanders says he doesn't "like using those words but clearly he has a strong, strong tendency toward authoritarianism. … You can describe him as a fascist." pic.twitter.com/VZJq50EDro Welker then showed Sanders a video clip from Uncommitted National Movement co-founder Layla Elabed, in which Elabed said that Harris had not earned her vote because she had refused to adopt a more humanitarian approach to Israel’s assault on Gaza, which has killed nearly 43,000 and wounded over 100,000 according to official figures. “It seems the signal we’ve gotten from her and her campaign is that she is willing to risk a battleground state like Michigan by continuing to alienate young people, Arab Americans, and Muslim Americans,” Elabed said. Sanders acknowledged the devastation wrought by Israel in Gaza as well as his disagreements with the Biden administration’s approach. “My own view has been that the United States should not continue to provide financial aid or offensive weapons to Netanyahu’s right-wing, extremist government,” Sanders said. However, he continued, “Trump is even worse on this issue.” “I can tell you we are desperately trying at the very least to get humanitarian aid, to feed starving children, into Gaza,” he said. While Harris and President Joe Biden support sending aid, Sanders added, “We can’t even get Republicans to feed the kids who are in desperate shape.” WATCH: A leader of the pro-Palestinian Uncommitted Movement told #MTP Kamala Harris hasn't “earned her vote." @BernieSanders shares his message to her and similar voters: "Trump is even worse on this issue. … While I disagree with Biden and Harris — they are still better." pic.twitter.com/xs3WXTSopC Finally, Welker asked Sanders about revelations from The Wall Street Journal this week that Trump supporter and richest man in the world Elon Musk is in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite having access to classified U.S. government information as a federal contractor. Sanders said Musk’s communication with Putin was “inappropriate,” but had a deeper concern about Musk’s role in a potential Trump administration. “What really interests me is if, God forbid, Trump were to win, whether it would be Elon Musk running the government, and Trump working for him, or the other way around,” Sanders said. He continued: “The idea that you have somebody like Musk who has massive amounts of federal contracts, campaigning hard, putting huge amounts of money into Trump’s campaign, man if there’s ever been a conflict of interest, that’s it.” WATCH: @BernieSanders says it's inappropriate that Elon Musk has reportedly been in contact with Putin for two years. "What really interests me is if … Trump were to win, whether it would be Elon Musk running the government and Trump working for him or the other way around." pic.twitter.com/84uHotWmBU Sanders’ warning about Musk’s influence comes the same day as the Tesla CEO is scheduled to headline a Trump rally in New York City’s Madison Square Garden. Musk has recently come under fire for offering to pay $1 million a day to a select registered voter in a swing state who signs a petition hosted by his super PAC, which one legal expert described as “clearly illegal vote-buying.”
The severity of these threats highlights the need for electoral safety planning among movement groups and organizations. The 2024 presidential election is creating major safety concerns for election officials, poll watchers, activists, and marginalized communities. For months, the Department of Homeland Security has been warning election officials nationwide about the potential for right-wing violence on and around Election Day. DHS has flagged efforts by right-wing extremists to incite attacks on election infrastructure, which could include bombing ballot dropboxes, lone-wolf attacks on election facilities, or the assassination of lawmakers. On November 5, 200,000 volunteers from Donald Trump’s campaign will deploy across the country to monitor polling places and “ establish the battlefield ” for a contested election. These volunteers have been tasked with gathering the “evidence” that was missing during Trump’s previous attempt to overturn the election. Given that Trump, JD Vance, and Trump’s bouncy , billionaire fanboy Elon Musk have been aggressively promoting conspiracy theories about immigrants voting illegally, this surveillance effort will likely target Black and brown people who Trump supporters perceive as foreign. That targeting will almost certainly result in voter intimidation and could lead to violence. Hoaxes about migrant communities, amplified by Donald Trump and JD Vance on the campaign trail, have already resulted in bomb threats against schools, hospitals, and government buildings in Springfield, Ohio. Unfortunately, these threats will not be confined to Election Day, as pro-Trump forces are primed to use lawsuits and new election rules in some states to create delays, sow doubt, and produce spaces of contestation. The severity of these threats highlights the need for electoral safety planning among movement groups and organizations. To explore these concerns, I recently spoke with Che Johnson-Long, the Community Safety Education Coordinator with Vision Change Win (VCW). Che is a queer community organizer and security practitioner. She develops community safety curricula, coaches left movement organizations and coordinates VCW’s safety and security programmatic offerings. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Kelly Hayes: What is electoral safety planning? Che Johnson-Long: Honestly, it’s not all that different from safety planning. I think any left movement group should be doing some regular assessment of safety threats and then creating protocols that help groups safeguard against those threats. That can mean anything from creating internal protocols about how you share documents and when to developing a safety team whenever you have internally coordinated events. So safety planning in general, I think, is just groups being able to regularly assess risk and then create plans to intervene. Electoral safety planning means considering that, while we do this regular safety planning, election season creates a unique hodgepodge of threats, and the political landscape changes really rapidly. Threats often get amplified before national elections and sometimes local elections. Electoral safety planning means thinking about the work that you do in relationship to elections, but then also just thinking about the political landscape that we swim in regardless of how you interact with elections. Groups that do 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) work have to consider the ways that compliance laws might impact them and protect their groups from acting out of compliance, which can lead to IRS audits. That means making sure that they’re clear on the difference between (c)(3) work and (c)(4) work. For some groups, it means making sure that they have a strong plan for what information canvassers might have access to and then how to remove those access points once they’re done canvassing. I think electoral safety planning is for everybody, including groups that don’t believe in or participate in national elections. A more emboldened far-right impacts all of our left movement groups. When there are more counter-protesters at our actions and more threats to verify online, all of our safety plans should take that into account. What are some of the potential threats that organizers are concerned about in the run-up to this election? We’re seeing a lot of targeting of our communities. The GOP has been spending a ton of money to create these targeted ads that are really, I think, trying to create a transphobic political landscape. They’ve spent $17 million to highlight moments when Harris has expressed support for gender-affirming care, and we know what that is, right? We know that it’s an attack on Democrats, but more importantly, it’s an attack on trans people. I think these national elections always embolden the far right. We’ve heard of threats that different far-right groups, like the Proud Boys, are making on their website to target drop boxes and some polling locations. They’ve been making these threats since the summer, so they’re not new, and we saw similar things in 2020. Voter suppression and election denial can also create safety threats that actually go beyond Election Day or the ballot box. For example, the Georgia Board of Elections, which is Republican-run, has this new rule about Georgia hand-counting ballots, and it’s being disputed in court right now. In 2020, there was a similar hand-counting rule in Pennsylvania, and there were so many protests organized by people who were seeking to deny the election results. There were so many counter-protesters; there were so many death threats that were made by election deniers because this hand-counting rule created an opening and an opportunity for folks to get targeted. These election denial and voter suppression tactics impact people’s voting rights but also can impact community safety more broadly. We also have to think about police violence. I think that we will definitely see a more substantial police presence at the protests and rallies that happen after Election Day. We’re already seeing a huge uptick in political violence more broadly, and I think that police violence at protests will only get more intense if there’s a contested election. I really appreciate what you’re saying about how some of these Republican policies are really about manufacturing uncertainty, which creates space for contestation and violence. Wherever they can create delays or confuse the process, they can conjure conspiracies and cast election officials, or particular groups or demographics, as villains who are trying to steal the election. The more unsure people are, the more strongholds fascists can claim. These far-right groups and other bad actors are really just looking for any political excuse to harm our communities and our movements. In Vision Change Win’s Electoral Safety Toolkit , VCW recommends crafting a safety plan six months ahead of a national election. For people who’ve been engaged in that work, what have those preparations looked like? A lot of electoral groups have long-standing organizational safety practices. Some of those practices include making sure that they have increased digital security and making sure that the leaders of those organizations are regularly guarding against things like doxxing. So they are using DeleteMe , they are tracking where their personal information is online, and they’re intentionally getting rid of information that doesn’t need to be spread online. I think, in a lot of ways, they’re just tightening practices that already exist. So again, that means getting really clear about that (c)(3), (c)(4) compliance. We’re already seeing a lot of increase around IRS audits, especially amongst Black-led groups and trans-led groups, and so I think that those are the kinds of safety threats that most groups won’t feel in November, but they will feel in the following six months, and so making sure that they’re clear about separating (c)(3) and (c)(4) work. I think a lot of 501(c)(3) groups need to make sure that they’re extra clear about what’s (c)(4) work, getting clear about the difference between endorsing a candidate or even discouraging people publicly from voting for a candidate. That’s the kind of stuff that I think a lot of groups in the next six months are going to see a lot of scrutiny from the state about, and we just want to minimize any opportunity for the state to come in and audit a group or prevent them from being able to do the work that they do. I think for many groups, it’s about increasing their situational awareness. That means tracking who attends their rallies, monitoring their social media with a little bit more rigor, documenting weird comments, or noticing folks who are parked outside or weird vans. Some of it is just about communicating when they notice things that might be a little out of the ordinary. For some groups, I think it’s really increasing the rigor around their member vetting, so noticing membership changes. A lot of people will seasonally volunteer at electoral organizations, but also just left-movement groups in general as we get closer to elections. I think it’s great whenever we have this influx of volunteers, but people also need to be mindful about how they offer access points to new members or to volunteers, making sure that you’re vetting with extra scrutiny for folks who might become member leaders in your group and really keep an eye out for bad actors or potential infiltration. Your group provides a lot of rapid response support to organizers and activists who are facing threats. I have benefitted from that assistance during dangerous times, as have people I have referred to VCW. So, I have a deep appreciation for the work that you all do. Amid all of that work and your ongoing educational programs, what have your electoral safety planning support efforts looked like in 2024? We built out this electoral safety training program, gosh, almost three years ago, and I think for us, we believe in safety planning early and not waiting till the last minute, because we know that infrastructure building takes time. So whenever we can, we encourage groups to make sure that they’re thinking about electoral safety months out from an election. So for us, that means offering our training series , since 2022, training groups and encouraging groups to get trained six or nine months ahead of an election, so that they have enough infrastructure to be prepared for unexpected threats. We also know that sometimes threats are difficult to plan around, or they just genuinely do surprise us, and so we offer rapid response support, and we’ve increased that support and also made it public to really try to meet the need, or the anticipated need, I should say. We created an Electoral Safety Toolkit . I find that a lot of groups who are already at low capacity end up experiencing even lower capacity as we get closer to elections. Safety threats are overwhelming, because a lot of groups are already operating with a very small team or with a very small budget, and so the toolkits are a way of making a free offering to folks who want a safety plan, but don’t have time to attend a training. Then I think, more than anything, we’ve just been really trying to encourage left movement groups, left funders, individual activists, collectives, everyone that we roll with to consider safety threats regardless of whether or not they do direct electoral organizing. I think there are a lot of abolitionists in my world who I love and care about who, for a lot of understandable reasons, have decided not to engage in electoral politics at the national level, and I don’t think that insulates them from the safety threats that can get worse during the electoral season. So, if anything gets to the masses from our work, I hope it’s that. I hope that all left movement groups are considering the community safety threats that increase during this time and that we’re all doing what we can to plan around it. Because our left movement work is too precious, abolition work is too important to not safeguard. Are there any steps or precautions you would recommend for people who have not been engaged in safety planning in recent months, but who are getting worried now about potential threats around the election? The thing I was saying earlier about situational awareness, I think folks who haven’t been planning, but are starting to now, or at least starting to get worried now, I think those groups can also increase their situational awareness at the individual level or at the organizational level. So individuals should notice if you’re getting the same threatening comments on your social media from an account that seems fishy or that seems like a bot, and you should tell other folks that you organize with. The awareness piece is half of it and the other piece is communicating potential safety threats with your comrades and with the folks that you organize with. At the organizational level, I think a lot of the same things apply. Making sure that you are tracking who comes to your membership meetings, making sure that you’re increasing your member vetting practices. I also think there’s something about communication discipline that we can all improve on, in terms of stopping the spread of misinformation. There are so many ways that misinformation is spreading. I recently learned about this effort, funded by Elon Musk, to spread misinformation while impersonating the Harris campaign via text, with messages that send people to a fake website. We need clarity. As left movement folks, organizers, and activists, we need to get clear on when a threat is a verified threat, meaning someone has researched it, they’ve checked it out, and when it’s a rumor. We need to have discipline individually and inside our organizations to not spread threats that are actually rumors, because that can also clog up our communication channels and make it difficult for us to know how to respond or how to prioritize what to respond to. I think everyone can stand to have an updated emergency contact form that they share not only with their organizing work, but also with the folks who are in their life who are important to them, including their family and friends. Having a plan for an arrest, for a medical emergency, having an emergency contact form that someone can look at if they just haven’t heard from you in a few days, who to talk to. Unfortunately, it’s becoming increasingly important, especially for southern organizers, to make an emergency contact plan for climate crisis disasters. So we’ve seen how the two most recent hurricanes have impacted a lot of folks in the Southeast, and I think some of the hardest pieces of that are just being able to locate people and get a sense of who is already in contact with folks and who is missing. So if you don’t do anything else, just creating an emergency contact form, which can take ten minutes, can mean the difference between us looking for people who are not actually missing and us focusing on folks who might’ve been arrested without our knowledge, had a medical emergency without our knowledge, or, heaven forbid, have disappeared without our knowledge. That’s great advice. I also think people who still rely on Elon Musk’s social media app for information about movements or politics really need to have contingency plans, especially around Election Day, because that app has become a bullshit chamber that amplifies confusion and misinformation by design. To be reliant on it, when Musk is clearly willing to cross any line for the sake of his fascistic agenda is a bad idea. We need to broaden our networks and broaden our options. I think that’s a safety concern at this point. Agreed. Circling back to the threat of right-wing violence, I have seen some people on social media dismiss concerns about violence on and around Election Day. People who write off these concerns often assert that Trump supporters are “all talk.” While I obviously hope that nothing violent occurs, I also find these dismissals confusing, given the realities of right-wing violence in the United States. Some people seem to feel that our only options are to cower in fear, assuming that violence is inevitable, or to dismiss the threat entirely. What are your thoughts on how we should approach concerns about violence on and around November 5th? First, I just want to make space first to say that the cowering or the dismissing, that these responses are understandable in a political climate when many, especially communities of color, especially Black folks, especially trans folks, are under constant attack. So, for a lot of groups, especially groups who are targeted by the state, we’ve been experiencing safety threats at an increased level for months now. So I just want to name that for a lot of folks, that kind of trauma response or that way that we’ve responded to harm that’s happened to us in the past–these responses are understandable. I can understand why someone would respond that way, and also, trauma responses do not assess risk well. In some ways, they’re kind of like one-trick ponies. A trauma response might replicate one way that I responded to a threat back in 2010, and I might repeat that response in 2024 as if it were 2010. So there’s a way that those trauma responses can get us very stuck in time. So, while I get the trauma responses and I get the ways that people are responding to the right, I also think that we don’t have the luxury of time or capacity to waste on not doing thorough risk assessments. So I think that folks should listen to experts, learn how to spot deep fakes, learn how to verify information, and I kind of just think people need to build up their own risk assessment muscle and not just take my word for it. So whenever I’m talking to people about risk assessments, I usually invite folks to look at what’s happening at the national level, at the local level, and in their own group’s history. What I’m seeing at the national level is that the Department of Homeland Security has started to reach out to different local agencies about potential attacks, and I think once DHS gets worried enough to start reaching out to local agencies about the far-right, it says something. It says that I think this could be a likely threat. We’ve already seen verified accounts of the Proud Boys and other bad actors making threats to ballot boxes as far back as May and June, so I can see the threat getting verified at the national level. At the local level, I think every region is going to experience far-right violence very differently, and so I encourage folks to talk to regional partners, coalitions, and state tables. For folks who aren’t clear about where to reach out to, I think folks should look to national groups like the Working Families Party or State Voices , who are doing a lot of coordination with local and statewide tables to get a sense of what is the actual threat to harm. Then I find a lot of groups, especially groups who are more than five years old, do great work, but they tend to not document safety threats well over time, and so I’m noticing that some of the groups that I’m supporting now in 2024 have experienced attacks in 2020 that they never documented. So, the leaders that are coming to me now actually have no idea that their group experienced death threats from Nazis in their email, or the threat of violence or actual violence at their protests, because they weren’t leaders in 2020. So, for a lot of these groups, the work is to go back to leaders who were around then and make sure that we’re talking to folks who came before us about threats they experienced. I’m not just talking about 2020, which is only four years ago. I’m talking about going back to leaders of your group to ask them how they navigated far-right violence and right-wing violence, especially southern organizers who tend to experience a disproportionate amount of that harm and who also tend to be incredibly under-resourced to address the harm. Safety planning, when it’s done well, strengthens our organizations, regardless of the outcome. So, if a bad thing doesn’t happen, great, but if I have a strong member vetting practice, then that also means I’m going to have a strong base-building practice and leadership development practice, because those go hand in hand. So when we incorporate these practices into our organizing, it also means that we just have more effective, resilient organizations, which I think is everybody’s goal.
The DOJ has warned Elon Musk’s PAC that his $1 million sweepstakes for swing state voters may violate federal law. On Wednesday afternoon, the Department of Justice (DOJ) warned Elon Musk that he might be in violation of federal laws as regards his extraordinary recent interventions into the election process. The backstory: In mid-October, shortly after Elon Musk had made a joint appearance with Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where the world’s richest man jumped up and down like a peculiarly malign Energizer bunny, Musk started running a daily million-dollar lottery , which will continue until Election Day. The only people eligible are registered voters in the seven swing states upon which the election result will hinge who have signed Musk’s petition ostensibly calling for the defense of First and Second Amendment rights. Further pushing up against the legal limits that prevent the purchasing of voter registration or actual votes, Musk offered to pay individuals $47 for each swing state signature they gather . All of this is the bizarre apogee of Elon Musk’s pandemic-era rightward transformation into a dyed-in-the-wool purveyor of “alt-right” conspiracy theories. Musk’s politics are, these days, defined by hostility to public health mandates and opposition to government regulation, by his funding of anti-immigrant initiatives — and nationalist figures such as Stephen Miller — and his fierce opposition to trans rights . As the owner of X (formerly known as Twitter), he has been on a crusade for a vision of “free speech” that consists of little more than providing a platform to one bilious racist and fascist after the next. (At the same time, thin-skinned as he is, he has used his power to shut down the voices of those who oppose his politics .) He has become a pro-gun fundamentalist and a purveyor of the racist “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which baselessly posits that liberals in the West are involved in an act of cultural and racial suicide by supporting mass migration into wealthy countries as a way to dilute these nations’ racial, religious and cultural purity. After the anti-immigrant riots in the U.K . this summer, Musk retweeted ludicrous claims that the British government is setting up concentration camps in the remote Falkland Islands for right-wing, nationalist rioters; announced that “civil war is inevitable” ; and spent weeks baiting the new Labour government and its prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, accusing it of a double standard when it came to policing, alleging that white, right-wing protesters are being dealt with more harshly than nonwhite, nonright-wing activists. But it is in the United States that Musk’s political footprint is most pronounced. Immediately after Donald Trump was shot at during a rally in July, Musk took to his social media platform to issue a full-throttle endorsement of the MAGA man . His infatuation with Trump has, since then, become an expensive passion. Musk has pumped over $75 million into a super PAC working for Trump’s election , and this week directly donated to the Trump campaign the maximum allowed for one individual: $924,600. The reaction to Musk’s lottery within the election law community has been scathing . One expert after another has said this seems to be a blatant attempt to purchase ballot box participation in critical swing states — which violates federal law and could expose Musk to a felony conviction and prison sentence. Like Trump, the beneficiary of all this largesse, Musk seems utterly unconcerned with abiding by the rules and restrictions surrounding this sort of gimmicky expenditure, continuing his daily lottery in the face of growing outrage from legal scholars and basically daring the Justice Department or state district attorneys to take action against him. As of Wednesday, it appears that the Justice Department is moving on the issue — which will likely provide further fodder for Musk and Trump’s inane musing about a deep state conspiracy to shut them down. Musk’s multimillion-dollar spree aimed at influencing the outcome of the 2024 election is largely an updated, more technological version of Tammany Hall. Musk has also used his ownership of the X social media platform to repeatedly pump his own pro-Trump announcements into the feeds of tens of millions of social media users. Those propaganda videos don’t carry much intellectual heft, but they don’t need to. Musk has more than 200 million X followers globally. And, in addition, he has a captive audience. I, for example, have never followed Elon Musk on X, but that doesn’t prevent my feed from being saturated with pro-Trump announcements by X’s boss. If Trump gets elected amid Musk’s swing state lotteries, Musk will be well situated to angle for a senior position in his administration. Trump has indicated he would give him a position that would be akin to what the GOP candidate has taken to calling a “Secretary of Cost-Cutting,” essentially charged with eviscerating the regulatory agencies that might stand in the way of even more market dominance by the wealthiest person on Earth as he seeks to expand his social media footprint, his defense and space industry contracts, and his Starlink internet delivery service. Musk’s companies have accumulated a trail of legal woes over the years almost as long as those of Donald Trump and his companies. Tesla is facing lawsuits for a series of fatal crashes involving their driverless technology. SpaceX has been accused of violating labor laws by pursuing retaliatory firings against staff who wrote memos critical of Musk. And the list goes on. In the world of Trumpland, where quid pro quo reigns supreme–, Musk’s huge efforts on Trump’s behalf in the run-up to the election are likely to reap political rewards at the backend, including pressure to make the lawsuits against Musk’s companies disappear. Looked at that way, the more than $100 million that Musk is throwing into the Trump election campaign, and the frenetic effort to get “low-propensity” voters to sign petitions aimed mainly at politicizing people into a Trumpist vision of the world through dangling the prospect of a million-dollar pay day, is all simply a business expense. Bells and whistles notwithstanding, it’s also not particularly original. Musk’s multimillion-dollar spree aimed at influencing the outcome of the 2024 election is largely an updated, more technological version of the antics of the corrupt politicians who governed New York City for over a century under the moniker of Tammany Hall . Led by machine politicians such as “Boss” William Tweed, who reached an apex of power — and of illegality — in the decade after the Civil War, Tammany Hall became a byword for corruption and venality, its foot soldiers adept at buying votes for its leaders in poorer neighborhoods throughout the city. Tweed’s methods ranged from offering jobs and city contracts to those who favored him and his allies at the ballot box, through to outright purchasing of votes — or, when that failed, to having his henchmen manufacture election results pretty much out of whole cloth , oftentimes simply by stuffing ballot boxes . As with Musk’s efforts, so Tweed’s should be understood as a high-return investment. Estimates are that, in modern-day dollar terms, Tweed milked the city’s taxpayers to the tune of well over $1.5 billion, regarding his control over city government as giving him leeway to take cuts in every contract he could lay his hands on. Not that Tweed himself was particularly unique in his willingness to buy votes. In fact, before Boss Tweed there was the old American tradition — indulged in even by George Washington himself — of buying votes with whiskey and other alcoholic beverages. And before the use of hard liquor to craft electoral majorities, there were the notorious rotten boroughs that generated many of the members of Parliament (MPs) in the British Isles in the 18th century. These rural boroughs had been largely depopulated by demographic and economic shifts, leaving a tiny population to choose an MP — and making it particularly easy for corrupt politicians to buy their way into Parliament by bribing or extorting the few remaining residents, most of them impoverished farm- and day-laborers, to cast their votes the “right” way. Musk is attempting a similar heist on a far grander scale, his efforts largely made possible by the Supreme Court’s notorious 2010 Citizens United ruling. Prior to the Reform Act of 1832, which massively expanded the franchise and ended the rotten borough system, roughly a quarter of all the parliamentary seats in the British Isles were rotten boroughs , with several dozen of them having less than 50 voters. These seats were quite literally regarded as the personal property of the men who got “elected” in them. Musk is attempting a similar heist on a far grander scale, his efforts largely made possible by the Supreme Court’s notorious 2010 Citizens United ruling, which opened up the door for megacontributions to political action committees by super-wealthy influencers such as the owner of Tesla and X. He wants to convert the entire United States into his and Trump’s personal rotten borough, gambling that he can convince a critical mass of people to trade away their fundamental right of political choice in exchange for the chance to win a million dollars. Today, the question is whether Congress and the Supreme Court will ever muster the will to rein in the extraordinarily power-hungry Musk, and, in the coming days, whether the Department of Justice will have the power to stop Musk from continuing his lottery. I’m not holding my breath on Congress and the Supreme Court stepping in to limit these efforts by the hyperrich and powerful to capture the political system for their own personal advantage. But, with the news this Wednesday that the Department of Justice has warned Musk about his actions, it’s just possible that the DOJ might have the gumption to take on the world’s wealthiest — and perhaps most politically consequential — businessman.
Musk is giving $1 million to random voters who sign his “petition in favor of free speech and the right to bear arms.” Election law experts said over the weekend that billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s latest ploy to entice voters in battleground states to sign his “petition in favor of free speech and the right to bear arms” appears to be flagrantly illegal. According to Musk, an outspoken supporter of Republican nominee Donald Trump , the scheme involves a random $1 million payment each day to one registered voter who signs the petition , which is officially hosted by a super PAC founded and financed by Musk. Rick Hasen, a law professor at UCLA, argued that by only offering the $1 million reward to registered voters in swing states, Musk’s effort amounts to “clearly illegal vote-buying.” In a blog post , Hasen pointed to 52 U.S.C. 10307(c) , which states that anyone who “pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.” “I’d like to hear if there’s anyone who thinks this is not a clear case of a violation,” Hasen wrote. Making a million dollar prize contingent on registering to vote is illegal. See 52 USC 10307(c) Also, with PA registration soon closing for this election it may not accomplish what Musk wants. According to the petition website, only registered voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, and North Carolina are eligible for the $1 million prize. Musk’s super PAC is also offering $47 to people who refer other registered voters to sign the petition. Derek Muller, an election law expert at Notre Dame Law School, said Sunday that “when you start limiting prizes or giveaways to only registered voters or only people who have voted, that’s where bribery concerns arise.” “By limiting a giveaway only to registered voters,” Muller added, “it looks like you’re giving cash for voter registration.” Musk announced the price Saturday during a town hall event in Pennsylvania, declaring that “every day between now and the election we will be awarding $1 million, starting tonight.” As NBC News reported , “Musk delivered the first of the checks Saturday to a man who emerged from the crowd to loud cheers, saying the man ‘had no idea’ he’d be selected.” “The only thing we ask for the million dollars is that you be a spokesperson for the petition,” said Musk. “And that’s it, really.” Following the town hall, Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called Musk’s scheme “deeply concerning” and said it is “something that law enforcement could take a look at.” “Musk obviously has a right to be able to express his views,” Shapiro added. “He’s made it very, very clear that he supports Donald Trump. I don’t. Obviously we have a difference of opinion. I don’t deny him that… but when you start flowing this kind of money into politics, I think it raises serious questions.”
An initiative called Progress 2028 is actually run by a dark money network supporting Donald Trump. An initiative called Progress 2028 that purports to be Kamala Harris’ liberal counter to the conservative Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 is actually run by a dark money network supporting former President Donald Trump. Building America’s Future, the dark money group at the helm of the network, has steered money to a constellation of groups and initiatives boosting Trump’s agenda and spreading messaging aimed at chipping away voters from Harris. The dark money group reportedly received over $100 million in funding from billionaire Elon Musk, along with other donors, The New York Times recently reported . The newest effort to benefit from their largesse is Progress 2028. Building America’s Future registered to use Progress 2028 as a fictitious name on Sept. 23 and the website was created three days later, OpenSecrets’ analysis of corporate filings and DNS records found. The Progress 2028 site appears to be created by IMGE LLC , a firm run by Republican political operatives that The New York Times described as the “hidden hand” behind Building America’s Future, and a page on the Progress 2028 site includes the firm’s sizzle reel. IMGE LLC has also done work for Elon Musk’s America PAC and several other Republican political committees , including a super PAC funded by America’s Future Fund named Future Coalition PAC, as first pointed out by Brendan Fischer, Deputy Executive Director of Documented , an investigative watchdog and journalism project. The Progress 2028 manifesto draws clear parallels to Project 2025, a controversial blueprint for restructuring the executive branch under the next Republican administration. The Project 2025 blueprint was developed by the Heritage Foundation and written by many conservatives who worked in or with Trump’s administration. Project 2025 has drawn intense criticism , and the former president has said it does not reflect his own priorities should he return to the White House. Some of the policies listed in Progress 2028 highlight disproven and misleading claims about Harris’ positions. Policies listed include “Empowering Undocumented Immigrants, Building Our Future” and “Expanding Medicaid to Undocumented Immigrants.” “Undocumented immigrants are the backbone of our country, and by removing barriers, we unlock incredible potential,” the document states. “Kamala Harris believes that every person, no matter their immigration status, deserves access to basic healthcare.” Harris expressed support for allowing immigrants residing in the U.S. to obtain health insurance with her 2019 Medicare for All plan but did not indicate whether there would be a cost. Her 2024 running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, recently said that Harris does not currently support programs for undocumented immigrants to qualify for free government health care, free tuition at state universities or driver’s licenses. The document claims Harris will “support policies that protect minors’ access to gender-affirming care and ensure that schools provide comprehensive LGBTQIA education.” “She’s committed to banning fracking, phasing out internal combustion engines, and rolling out the most progressive Green New Deal yet,” another section of the Progress 2028 plan reads. Harris has explicitly stated that she won’t ban fracking natural gas but her campaign has sent mixed signals about her own position on regulation of gas-powered cars . Some individuals have received text messages directing them to the Progress 2028 page. “Kamala Harris will support a nationwide gun buy-back program that will take dangerous weapons off our streets,” one text message reads, noting, “A mandatory buy-back is the only way to keep our streets safe.” Harris expressed support for a mandatory buyback of military assault weapons in 2019 but has expressed a more lenient stance in 2024, highlighting her own gun ownership. Progress 2028 has also started pouring money into digital advertising. Since Oct. 11, several digital ads on Facebook and Instagram have included the disclaimer “paid for by Progress 2028” — totaling over $36,000 in ad buys over just five days. While the ads appear to include pro-Harris messaging, they lean into contentious issues listed on the Progress 2028 site that have created friction among different divisions of the party. “Let’s remove barriers for undocumented immigrants who are undocumented!” one ad states, adding, “Access to affordable housing, driver licenses, and fair wages creates a stronger America for everyone.” Another ad reads, “A national, mandatory buy-back program means fewer guns & fewer tragedies. Kamala Harris gets it!” Operating under a shroud of aliases, Building America’s Future has funneled tens of millions of dollars in dark money from anonymous sources into campaigns boosting Trump ahead of the 2024 election. The dark money network also has a history of fueling initiatives impersonating and parodying Democrats. Building America’s Future is the top funder of Citizens for Sanity, a dark money group that bankrolled inflammatory ads mocking Democrats and progressive policies in battleground states ahead of 2022 midterms, tax returns show. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Elon Musk secretly steered tens of millions of dollars through Building America’s Future to help fund the effort. Citizens for Sanity spent over $90 million on messaging pitting minority communities against each other and chipping away at traditionally Democratic voting blocs. Similar to Progress 2028, the ads hit on contentious issues such as LGBTQ+ rights, immigration and criminal justice reform. The ads have been accused of trying to suppress voting among minority communities. Citizens for Sanity does not disclose its donors but other groups were legally required to report money they gave to it. That includes $43 million from Building America’s Future as well as $28.7 million from Freedom’s Future Fund, a sister group of Building America’s Future, and $13.4 million from American Commitment. Building America’s Future has also fueled other pro-Trump groups and was the sole funder of the Future Coalition PAC , new Federal Election Commission records filed Oct. 15 show. The super PAC that has run ads targeting Harris in Michigan by highlighting her positions that are pro-Israel and the Jewish faith of her spouse, Doug Emhoff. The ads are reported to be pro-Harris but have been criticized as featuring antisemitic dog whistles. The PAC has been accused of attempting to use the conflict in the Middle East as a wedge issue to depress turnout for Harris in Michigan, a state with a significant Muslim and Arab American population. Future Coalition PAC reported receiving $3 million from Building America’s Future through the end of September. Another $16 million was steered through Building America’s Future to Duty to America PAC , according to new FEC disclosures filed Oct. 15. The super PAC has targeted young male voters and Black voters trying to persuade them to vote for Trump. Building America’s Future was also the top funder of Stand For Us PAC , OpenSecrets’ analysis of FEC reports filed Oct. 15 found. The super PAC received at least $3.8 million from the dark money group and has spent over $15 million on ads attacking Republican primary candidates in Ohio with divisive messaging tying a prescription drug program to immigration and transgender rights. In addition to funding a cluster of political groups, Building America’s Future operates under several fictitious names such as Americans for Consumer Protection. In August, Americans for Consumer Protection launched an ad campaign criticizing the White House’s proposal to ban menthol cigarettes. CNBC reported that the effort was intended to chip away at Harris’ key base of Black voter support in swing states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin. Building America’s Future reportedly raised and spent more than $100 million over the last four years, The New York Times reported . Building America’s Future is not legally required to report its finances, vendor payments or outgoing grants for 2023 until after Election Day and, even then, will not be required to disclose its donors. OpenSecrets’ requests for comment to Building America’s Future and Progress 2028 were not returned prior to publication.
Elon Musk’s amplifying of dehumanizing lies suggests a willingness to stoke violence to shape electoral outcomes. This week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom made good on a promise to crack down on deepfakes by signing two bills into law. The bills require political advertisements to disclose any use of generative AI in the production process and also require social media companies to remove political ads that have been manipulated with AI within 72 hours of receiving a report from a user. Newsom vowed to pass such laws after Elon Musk shared a deepfake video of Vice President Kamala Harris in July. These measures come amid widespread concern about the impact deepfakes and misinformation could have on the presidential race. Musk has already attempted to leverage his platform for Donald Trump’s benefit by hosting a painfully dull conversation with the former president on X, spreading right-wing conspiracy theories, and boosting a xenophobic, anti-Black hoax about Haitian immigrants that Trump and JD Vance have amplified. In a recent post, Musk claimed, “Unless Trump is elected, America will fall to tyranny.” While Newsom’s move to restrict deepfakes will be lauded as an essential step by many, the potential impact of AI-generated content on the presidential race has been greatly exaggerated. While programs that can produce deepfakes have become more accessible and affordable, the quality of these videos remains low and unconvincing. While the technology may improve and become more threatening, AI was never going to alter the outcome of this presidential race. The most immediate danger posed by video deepfakes is to private individuals, including children, whose images can be exploited to create artificial sexual content. Some states, such as California, have already passed laws banning the creation of such material. Audio deepfakes, such as the fraudulent robocall that cloned President Biden’s voice during the New Hampshire primary, are more concerning, given that audio clones often create a more convincing product. Still, the audio deepfake of Biden’s voice did not impact the outcome of the New Hampshire primary, which Biden won by a wide margin. Like video deepfakes, audio deepfakes pose a greater threat to everyday people, as scammers can exploit them to impersonate loved ones, sending urgent pleas for financial help. However, unlike video deepfakes, audio deepfakes are not the stuff of viral trends. The visibility of imagery created by programs like Musk’s Grok, which lacks the ethical safeguards that many AI image generators include, has led many people to worry about the influence of such content. AI-generated imagery may indeed have an impact, but it’s unlikely to be persuasive in the way some fear. While AI-produced media probably won’t convince a confused electorate of outright lies, such content does aid the right-wing memeification of grievance. Hoaxes about Haitian immigrants, videos mimicking politicians, and fake images depicting Harris as a Communist dictator are all part of a political and cultural strategy — what one might call “a firehose of bullshit.” The right’s relentless blasts of bullshit are meant to drown out, rather than refute, legitimate facts and grievances. The point is not to debate reality but to dominate it. The images, editorial takes, and news we consume each day, at a rate our brains are wholly ill-equipped to process, are the proverbial water we’re swimming in. The more that water is polluted, the more disoriented we become. As we stumble over right-wing lies — fact-checking, refuting, and describing the detritus that surrounds us — we assume a defensive posture. The work of defending fascist targets takes precedence when people are under siege, and when the firehose of bullshit is firing full blast, people are constantly under siege. The fabric of any shared reality that extends beyond our political silos is constantly being patched, protected, and reinforced as variations of fascist narratives infiltrate the mainstream. In the absence of coherence, men like Trump, Vance, and Musk hope people will simply default to cognitive bias, uplifting what feels true as emblematic of their politics. Many of the people sharing memes about immigrants eating cats know that they are sharing debunked information — including JD Vance, who first brought these stories into the presidential discourse. Vance recently told CNN’s Dana Bash, “If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m gonna do.” Of course, when Vance refers to the “suffering of the American people,” he is not talking about Americans who are suffering in prisons, unhoused people, people who are being killed by police, or people who are dying because they cannot access adequate healthcare. He is using the words “the American people” to describe white Americans who feel Black people and immigrants are responsible for all of their misfortunes. While shameful, Vance’s comment also presents an opportunity to understand the fascistic mindset in matters of storytelling. The far right is creating emblematic narratives for people to latch onto. These stories do not need to be believed to be weaponized as representative of white people’s lived experiences. The goal is to override any discussion of the facts with a torrent of bullshit so that people can choose the emblems that suit them, wear those emblems, and charge into battle. If a particular story is shot down, we are simply challenged to understand why it resonates in the first place. If one story feels too absurd or has been too thoroughly debunked, there are plenty of others to choose from. Musk has repeatedly characterized hoaxes and conspiracy theories as “concerning” or as the “actual truth.” He responded to a post blaming “mass migration” for the racist lynch mobs in the UK by declaring “civil war is inevitable.” Most recently, he complained, in a now-deleted post, that “no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala.” While Musk is no strategic genius and lacks prowess as a content creator, he is participating in a political project that does not require brilliance or finesse. The fascist politics Musk has immersed himself in are not coherent or consistent, and the assertions made by right-wing politicians and influencers rarely hold up to scrutiny. Fascist rhetoric agitates and affirms those who appreciate it and disorients and preoccupies those who are threatened by it. Such ideas engulf public discourse and replace any coherent exchange of information or ideas with an endless storm of myth and vitriol. If “a firehose of bullshit” seems too vulgar a metaphor, one could say Musk seeks to turn the media landscape into a snow globe that he can grip and shake in his grubby billionaire hands, engulfing us in artificial storms at his whim. On Wednesday, Musk posted: Atheism left an empty spaceSecular religion took its place But left the people in despair Childless hedonism sans care Maybe religion’s not so bad To keep you from being sad I have written in the past about Musk’s relationship with the transhumanist and longtermist cults of Silicon Valley . Transhumanism was born out of a recognition that, in increasingly secular societies, many people longed for the certainty, structural understanding, and sense of purpose that religion can impart. In place of traditional religions, the tech world has seen the emergence of TESCREAL ideologies that justify the existence of billionaires and indulge fantasies about space exploration, eternal (digital) life, and the idea that we are living in a simulation. Musk’s argument that “Maybe religion’s not so bad” isn’t a sales pitch for Christianity but for the religiosity of his fascistic worldview. According to Musk’s philosophy, most of us are non-player characters (NPCs). That gamer mindset, which labels most of us as lacking independent thought, purpose, or agency, is a fascistic worldview that effectively classifies the majority of humanity as subhuman. In early September, Musk reposted a 4chan argument claiming that only “high T alpha males” and “aneurotypical people” are capable of critical thinking: People who can’t defend themselves physically (women and low T men) parse information through a consensus filter as a safety mechanism. They literally do not ask “is this true”, they ask “will others be OK with me thinking this is true”. This makes them very malleable to brute force manufactured consensus; if every screen they look at says the same thing they will adopt that position because their brain interprets it as everyone in the tribe believing it. Only high T alpha males and aneurotypical people (hey autists!) are actually free to parse new information with an objective “is this true?” filter. This is why a Republic of high status males is best for decision making. Democratic, but a democracy only for those who are free to think. Musk reposted the quote with the caption, “Interesting observation.” This openly fascistic rhetoric categorizes the majority of us as incapable of independent thought. In Musk’s view, we are non-player characters and, therefore, expendable subhumans. Musk’s acquisition of Twitter gave him possession of a vehicle for mass communication that has been crucial to the circulation of news globally and to the proliferation of movements. Twitter also played an important role in allowing marginalized groups to shape popular discourse. One of Musk’s motivations for acquiring Twitter was his fascistic mission to disempower people and groups who he blamed for spreading the “woke mind virus.” By influencing social standards and popularizing their cultural concerns and political grievances, marginalized people were upending dynamics that Musk believes are natural and innate – dynamics that privilege white, “high T alpha males” at the expense of others, who he views as fundamentally inferior, and less deserving of agency and survival. Movements have continued to utilize Musk’s platform to raise awareness about protests and global atrocities, but the site’s utility for people of conscience has waned, while its usefulness to fascists has grown exponentially. While Musk lacks the posting acumen to have the kind of influence he truly longs for, he has succeeded at further polluting the well of public discourse. How will this climate and Musk’s machinations influence the upcoming election? Some of Musk’s maneuvers on that front are already underway. Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, which is tied to his social media platform, has spread misinformation about Vice President Kamala Harris’ ballot eligibility in this election. Musk’s super PAC, AmericaPAC, has been accused of misleading voters about whether or not they have registered to vote while also harvesting their data. Election officials say that Musk’s conspiracy-minded posts alleging that undocumented immigrants will be voting — including Musk’s false claim that as many as two million non-citizens have been registered to vote in Texas, Arizona, and Pennsylvania — often coincide with increased demands that voting rolls be purged. These waves of anti-immigrant panic also cause officials to worry about violent threats. As Melissa Gira Grant has recently written , Trump appears poised to invoke narratives about undocumented immigrants voting to undermine the results of the election should he lose the race to Harris. Tropes about undocumented people voting have been trotted out by Republicans for decades to justify voter suppression tactics, such as voter ID laws. However, as Gira writes: The more recent twist now is to construct a scheme they say is led by Democrats to use migrants who have recently arrived to commit (nonexistent) voter fraud, sometimes seizing on the work of groups aiding recently arrived migrants, and capitalizing on social media’s power to make a lie louder than the truth. As the election approaches, I fully expect Musk to shake his snow globe as furiously as he can, spreading hoaxes about voter fraud and other lies about undocumented immigrants. I’m also concerned that he may attempt to incite unrest or foster a sense of danger in specific voting districts. Musk’s comments about the inevitability of “civil war” and his practice of amplifying dehumanizing lies all suggest a willingness to stoke violence to shape electoral outcomes. Musk, of course, is deeply invested in the political trajectory of J.D. Vance, who some have argued is a political extension of fascistic tech billionaire Peter Thiel. While Musk heaps praise on Trump, I believe his real investment in this election is putting Vance, who is a product of Silicon Valley, one 78-year-old heartbeat away from the presidency. We are in the midst of Silicon Valley’s biggest power play in the realm of national politics. It comes at a time when Big Tech is ramping up its contributions to climate chaos while over-investing in technologies the market seems poised to reject — products that, conveniently enough, are highly compatible with fascistic governance. While Elon Musk is no strategic genius, it’s important to remember that the same can be said of Donald Trump. Neither of these men are brilliant thinkers, yet one has already ascended to the presidency. While various factors contributed to Trump’s rise in 2016, his presence on Twitter is widely regarded as a key element in his success. Social media is an unwieldy, unpredictable tool, but it is full of unstable political potential. It’s also important to recognize that a decisive victory for the Democrats would not end the threat techno-fascists like Musk pose. While Musk is heavily invested in this election, this moment is merely a stage in a much larger project for men like Musk and Thiel. If Trump falls, the techno-fascists will push on, and their efforts to rewire the information landscape will continue. With journalism, as an industry, more or less collapsing, we are incredibly vulnerable to such moves. To reduce that vulnerability, we need to double down on the creation of new information networks outside of Musk’s app, support publications and journalists whose work we believe in, and develop our own best practices around consuming, verifying, and spreading information.
The GOP vice presidential nominee says he has spoken to the multi-billionaire about working in a Trump administration. In a recent interview, Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance suggested that multi-billionaire Elon Musk would consider making cuts to Social Security if Donald Trump is elected president this fall. Earlier in September, Trump pledged to create a “government efficiency commission” tasked with making cuts to federal spending. He also said that he had discussed the idea with Musk, who told Trump he would lead the commission . Musk confirmed the conversation on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying that he’d happily lead such a commission in a Trump administration. In a podcast interview last week, Vance said that he, too, has had conversations about the idea with Musk. “I’ve spoken with Elon a little bit about ,” Vance said in the interview . Although the task force would theoretically look at all federal spending, Vance specifically cited two agencies that would be under Musk’s purview if such a scenario were to play out. Vance said that the “complicated” part of the commission’s work would be developing a strategy to examine each agency’s spending. “It’s going to look much different in, say, the Department of Defense versus Social Security,” Vance said. As reported by The New Republic , Vance’s comments indicate that no government agency — including programs like Social Security — would be off-limits to Musk’s “efficiency” commission. The publication’s report also noted that Musk’s decision-making when it comes to his own businesses hasn’t exactly been sound — when the billionaire purchased Twitter, for example, he fired around 80 percent of the staff on what was basically a whim in the name of trimming spending, a move that contributed to the rise in far right extremist accounts and vitriol on the site that has persisted ever since. That Musk could potentially have a decision-making role in a future Trump administration is troubling, as he has shared numerous false conspiracy theories on his account (including the baseless “Pizzagate” theory). He has also promoted accounts and posts pushing far right and antisemitic viewpoints, including some that deny historical events like the Holocaust. More recently, Musk issued a post questioning why President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris haven’t yet been targets of assassination attempts during the presidential campaign. After his post was met with widespread criticism, Musk deleted it and claimed it was a “joke,” despite stating in replies to the post that he was asking a serious question.
“o one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala,” Elon Musk wrote in a now-deleted post. Major defense contractor Elon Musk suggested in a now-deleted post on social media that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris should be targeted for assassinations after the Secret Service foiled what the FBI said was an apparent plot on Donald Trump’s life on Sunday. In a post on X, Musk quoted a post from a user who asked, “Why they want to kill Donald Trump?” Musk, adding his own commentary, said, “And no one is even trying to assassinate Biden/Kamala,” with a thinking emoji. Musk doubled down in a reply to someone telling him to “reconsider” the post, saying, “No one has even tried to do so is the point I’m making and no one will.” This post, unlike the original one, is still up as of Monday morning. After deleting the post musing about assassinating the president on Sunday, Musk suggested that he was joking. He claimed that there was “context” that users were missing, though left it unclear as to what context would make it a joke, rather than a seeming threat. On Sunday night, he also said in replies to the post that he was making a serious point. Whether or not he was joking, the post is alarming coming from a man with enormous power who supports the Republican Party, which has been working to radicalize its followers and foment political violence for many years — and who Trump has said he would tap for a cabinet position if he were elected. It is especially alarming coming from a man with insider knowledge of U.S. defense and security operations. Musk’s SpaceX is a major defense and intelligence contractor, having gotten billions of dollars in federal contracts to support military missions and build a covert network of spy satellites that allow federal officials the ability to monitor nearly the entire globe. In one post, Musk suggested that he was trying to point out that only Biden and Harris supporters would resort to violence, which is why there have been multiple seeming attempts on Trump’s life. This is patently untrue; research has found that right-wingers are responsible for the vast majority of extremist violence in the U.S., and experts have noted that far right violence is a growing concern as politicians have leaned further right in recent years. In reality, political assassination attempts are quite common , and are often plotted by right-wing actors — they are just typically foiled by federal officials before the would-be attacker can make it to, for instance, the roof of a nearby Trump rally. Several people, including people who openly identify as Trump supporters , have tried to kill Biden in recent years, but were stopped before they could execute their plans. Information is still emerging about the armed man who authorities arrested as he was trying to aim a gun into Trump’s golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he was playing golf on Sunday. In a book written by the suspect, Ryan Routh, about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Routh said he voted for Trump in 2016, but turned against him and wanted Iran to assassinate Trump, The Associated Press reported on Monday. Routh also emphasized in his book that he was a moderate who didn’t have any allegiance to any particular party. “I get so tired of people asking me if I am a Democrat or Republican as I refuse to be put in a category,” he wrote. Posts from his X account show that he was a fan of Tulsi Gabbard in 2020 and, this year, was rooting for Republican candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley. X and Facebook have both reportedly suspended Routh’s accounts. Other posts from his X account and bits from his book show that the man was a fervent supporter of Ukraine. The Guardian also interviewed Routh in 2022 as he was in a bustling train station in Poland where many were traveling to Ukraine shortly after Russia’s invasion first started; then, and on social media, Routh stated that he was ready to take up arms to fight for Ukraine. Trump and his allies also attempted to pin blame for the shooting at a Trump rally in July on Democrats. But that line of attack quickly fizzled out after the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was revealed to have similarly hard-to-label political allegiances as Routh. While Crooks had once made a small donation to a Democrat-leaning group, he was also registered to vote as a Republican. Probes into his internet searches prior to the shooting showed that he was seemingly looking to kill any high-profile politician , and had done research on both Trump and Biden speaking events.
Musk frequently promotes white nationalist viewpoints on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. During a speech on Thursday at the Economic Club of New York, former President Donald Trump suggested that he would enlist multi-billionaire Elon Musk to work in his administration and help him make cuts to government spending. Musk, who owns Tesla, X (formerly Twitter) and SpaceX, apparently made the suggestion to Trump himself, the Republican nominee for president explained. “I will create a government efficiency commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms,” Trump said during his speech. He added: Elon, because he’s not very busy, has agreed to head that task force. It’ll be interesting. If he has the time, he’ll be a good one to do it. On X , Musk said he was “look forward to serving America if the opportunity arises.” Trump: At the suggestion of Elon Musk.. I will create a government efficiency commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government… Elon has agreed to head the task force pic.twitter.com/57tdNkkI3U Musk, who decided to endorse Trump in July , would be a controversial choice to audit the government, to say the least. Since his purchase of Twitter two years ago, the site has become a bastion of far right extremism , with a notable rise in antisemitic content from white supremacist accounts, which Musk himself has often promoted by sharing such posts to his own profile. Most recently, Musk shared an interview by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, in which his guest wrongly suggested that the Holocaust during World War II was an accidental outcome, the fault of Allied powers reacting too aggressively to Adolf Hitler’s invasion of Poland. In reality, the Nazi regime was sending Jewish people to concentration camps a year before that invasion, and Jews were persecuted and stripped of any political rights at the start of Hitler’s chancellorship in the early 1930s. Despite these well-established facts, Musk seemingly agreed with Carlson’s guest, sharing a video of their interview on his account, calling it “very interesting” and “worth watching.” He later deleted the post. Musk also regularly shares conspiracy theories to his account , including the long-debunked “Pizzagate” theory that wrongly alleged that Democrats were part of a cult that preyed on children in a pizzeria. X is currently banned in Brazil for Musk’s refusal to name a legal representative to a court case in that country over complaints that the site isn’t dealing with hateful content in compliance with regulatory standards there. The billionaire has blasted Brazil for supposedly censoring his website — however, X itself regularly censors users on the site , including suspending journalists who have written articles about Musk that he disliked. Musk’s supposed defense of free speech is also dubious for other reasons. Earlier this year, in response to college demonstrators removing a U.S. flag from a campus to protest against Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza, Musk said that anyone performing such an act of civil disobedience should be deported from the country . Trump’s desire for Musk to be auditor of the government is perhaps tied with the Republican candidate’s economic plan, which includes calls for enormous tax cuts, much of which would be an extension of the cuts that went to the ultra-wealthy during his first tenure as president. This new round of tax cuts would total $10.5 trillion over the next decade . That amount is greater than the total spending for non-defense discretionary expenditures in the federal government, which totals $9.8 trillion and funds programs for health care and health research, veterans’ medical care and services, transportation services, the advancement of science and energy programs, and other spending priorities. If Trump’s proposal becomes a reality, Republicans would likely try to cut spending on these programs in order to deal with the immense debt that would be created by the tax cuts.
The order is the result of a monthslong feud between the billionaire and the Brazilian government. Brazilian Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Friday ordered the nationwide suspension of Elon Musk’s X social media platform in response to the billionaire’s failure to comply with the judge’s directive to appoint a legal representative in the South American country. Moraes ordered the “immediate, complete, and total suspension of X’s operations” in the nation of 215 million people, “until the court’s judicial decisions are complied with and the fines applied are paid” and “until a representative of the company in the country is appointed.” The judge also infuriated Musk by blocking his SpaceX company from conducting financial transactions in Brazil over millions of dollars in unpaid fines imposed on X — formerly known as Twitter — for breaking Brazilian laws. Earlier this month, Musk withdrew X’s staff from Brazil after Moraes threatened to arrest the company’s legal representative if the platform did not delete user accounts spreading far-right misinformation and hate speech in violation of Brazilian law. “Elon Musk showed his total disrespect for Brazilian sovereignty and, in particular, for the judiciary, setting himself up as a true supranational entity and immune to the laws of each country,” Moraes said . “The president of the National Telecommunications Agency, Carlos Manuel Baigorri, must take all measures to ensure the suspension,” Moraes continued, adding that he “also ordered Apple and Google to take measures to block the use of the application by iOS and Android systems, in addition to removing it from their virtual stores.” Internet service providers and app stores have five days to comply with Moraes’ ruling. People who use virtual public networks (VPNs) to skirt the new ban are subject to a roughly $8,900 fine. Moraes stated that he “made every possible effort and granted every opportunity for X Brazil to comply with the judicial orders and pay the fines, which would have avoided the adoption of this more serious measure.” “Unfortunately,” he added, “the illicit conduct was repeated in this investigation, making it clear that X Brazil failed to comply with several court orders, as well as the willful intention of evading responsibility for complying with the court orders issued.” In April, Moraes launched a criminal investigation into Musk’s alleged obstruction of justice and incitement to crime. Friday’s decision comes amid a monthslong feud between Musk — the world’s wealthiest person — and Moraes. Musk has accused the judge of “censorship” and of being a “tyrant.” “Alexandre de Moraes is an evil dictator cosplaying as a judge,” Musk said Thursday on X in one of several increasingly sophomoric posts. However, as Brazil-based journalist Brian Mier explained , “this is about sovereignty.” “Treating a system where the rich can buy more reach than normal citizens as if it were a democratic commons, as a ‘free speech’ issue, is ludicrous,” Mier wrote on X. “In the Global South, U.S. social media corporations are coup machines.” In the 1960s, the United States played an instrumental role in overthrowing a democratically elected Brazilian government and installing a 21-year military dictatorship in which a young Jair Bolsonaro — the former right-wing Brazilian leader who is the target of multiple criminal probes led by Moraes — served as an army officer. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva offered thoughts on Musk and the case ahead of Friday’s ruling during a television interview. “Who does he think he is?” asked Lula. “He has to respect the rules of this country.”
From Christian nationalists to fossil fuel barons, they are using their fortunes to pursue policies that impact us all. There’s less than three months to go until the U.S. presidential election on November 5, 2024. And like the sun rising, billionaires are increasingly making huge donations, or finding other ways to garner influence, to shape the election’s outcome and gain greater access and influence with its potential winner. We all have our own interests, causes, and commitments, but billionaires actually have the wealth to advance theirs at the highest heights of power. Billionaires may accumulate their wealth through companies that accept public subsidies, rely on public infrastructure, and exploit workers, but they use their private fortunes to pursue large-scale policy agenda that impact us all. This piece profiles a range of emblematic billionaires and the wider sectors, interests, and causes they represent. From far-right Christian nationalists to fossil fuel barons, from public education dismantlers to Silicon Valley monopolists, these billionaires are all showering money on, or elbowing their way toward more access to, the presidential candidates with the hope of advancing their agendas that are almost always in opposition to the needs of working class people. And remember: behind each one of these billionaires stands a broader set of elite interests and influence operations backed by an even wider network of other ultra-wealthy donors. Jeffrey Yass is the largest federal donor in the current election cycle, but if you haven’t heard of him yet, you’re not alone. Yass is not a very public figure, and he’s only started to make a big splash through his political donations over the past several years. Yass is worth a whopping $28.5 billion . He is the richest person in the state of Pennsylvania. Yass oversees a Wall Street trading firm called Susquehanna International Group (SIG), and he’s made a fortune off high-risk trading and investing. A big chunk of his wealth has come from his 7% share of ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Yass’s stake is worth an estimated $21 billion. Yass is something of a mini-Koch, funding a sprawling political operation made up of a range of rightwing groups and PACs. And no cause is dearer to Yass’s heart than school privatization. Yass has spent tens of millions pushing school vouchers in states like Pennsylvania , Texas and Kentucky , and also backing federal school privatization PACs like the Club for Growth’s School Freedom Fund and the American Federation for Children’s Victory Fund. While Yass hasn’t donated to any presidential candidate, he’s met with Trump, quickly flipping the former president’s position on TikTok. Yass has also invested in Trump’s social media platform, Truth Social, and there are rumors that Yass could end up in Trump’s cabinet. When it comes to school privatization, Yass appears to be motivated by his staunch libertarian ideology and belief that “free markets” solve all our problems, a savior complex, as well as tax credits for corporations that donate to private or charter schools. Yass’s goal of school privatization aligns with a fellow billionaire, former Trump education secretary Betsy DeVos. Depending on the election outcome, these billionaires stand to achieve their wildest dreams of dismantling public education in the U.S. While he doesn’t have a huge national profile, oil billionaire Tim Dunn is well known in Texas. For years, Dunn has poured tens of millions of dollars into Texas politics to shift the state’s GOP to the hard right — most notoriously, through the now-defunct Empower Texans , but also through a range of other groups and politicians, Dunn has advanced a far-right agenda, opposing everything from public school teachers to LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights, all driven by a Christian nationalist worldview. Now Tim Dunn, who made his billions off the West Texas fracking boom, is going national, donating $5 million to pro-Trump Super PAC, funding a Trump-aligned think tank, and vying for influence in a potential second Trump administration. The Texas Monthly has referred to Dunn as “the billionaire bully who wants to turn Texas into a Christian theocracy,” calling him “a key player in the growing Christian nationalism movement, which rejects the importance of pluralism to American identity” and instead “contends that only devout Christians are good Americans.” Former Texas House Speaker Joe Straus said that Dunn told him that “only Christians should hold leadership positions in the lower chamber,” according to Texas Tribune . It’s no secret that rightwing evangelical Christians are perhaps the largest part of Donald Trump’s political coalition. Dunn, as perhaps the most powerful member of that powerful base, isn’t the only religious zealot billionaire donor — look at, say, the Wilks brothers — but he’s clearly making moves to be a political insider at the national level. Depending on the election’s outcome, Dunn and his hard-right evangelical agenda stand to gain ground. The traditionally blue-leaning Silicon Valley — home of the likes of Google and Meta — has been making headlines this electoral season. Tech barons like David Sacks, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, and others are lining up behind Trump, creating a stark division within the tech billionaire class. But make no mistake: a slew of powerful Silicon Valley billionaires are still bankrolling the Democrats — and they’re hoping to protect their business interests. Take, for example, Reid Hoffman, worth $2.5 billion , and one of the top Democratic donors. Hoffman cofounded LinkedIn and, along with the likes of Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, was part of the “ PayPal mafia ” founders. He remains a major venture capital investor and sits on Microsoft’s board . As it became apparent that Kamala Harris would replace Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, Hoffman, who had donated a whopping $10 million to a pro-Biden and Harris super PAC, said he was “redoubling” his support for Harris. He just made one little recommendation, however: if elected, Harris should fire Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan , who has endured the wrath of billionaires across the industry and political spectrum for her muscular efforts in cracking down on monopoly practices and pushing new industry regulations. Hoffman also penned a New York Times op-ed advocating for Harris, saying she would be better for U.S. “innovation,” “economic prosperity,” and “national security,” at a time when things like AI, robotics, and autonomous vehicles — Silicon Valley profit engines — will assume ever greater importance. Hoffman is just one among a slew of tech titans backing Harris, including Netflix founder Reed Hastings and former Meta executive Sheryl Sandberg . As should be clear, much of Silicon Valley’s super-elite, while divided over who should be the next president, agree on taking down regulatory power that stands in their way. And they’ll all be doing just fine no matter the result of the election. It’s no secret that the fossil fuel industry has largely lined up behind the GOP. With the 2024 presidential election, oil and gas barons are hoping to usher in a fossil-friendly administration that will weaken the EPA, rollback regulations, and boost oil production. Harold Hamm, the CEO and Chairman of Continental Resources, is worth $18.5 billion , making him one of the wealthiest fracking billionaires in the world. The Oklahoma-based Continental Resources is among the very top independent oil producers in the U.S. Hamm had been a big Trump donor and close ally and advisor to Trump during his presidency. He distanced himself from Trump after 2020, but by the end of 2023 had come back around to backing Trump, donating and organizing fundraisers. Trump made headlines when he made — according to the Washington Post — a “remarkably blunt and transactional” offer to his oil baron donors at a Mar-o-Lago fundraiser that, if they donated $1 billion to him, he would reverse Biden-era environmental policies and halt any new ones if elected. Hamm has been corralling oil billionaire support for Trump. According to the Washington Post , “Hamm has a wish list of policy changes in a second Trump term that would pad his profits and those of other oil executives,” including “opening up more federal lands to drilling, easing the Endangered Species Act and curbing numerous regulations at the Environmental Protection Agency.” Oil billionaires who have attended Trump fundraisers and have donated to Trump also include Hilcorp Energy’s Jeff Hildebrand, GeoSouthern Energy’s George Bishop, and Energy Transfer Partners’ Kelcy Warren. Against the backdrop of rising climate chaos, efforts by oil billionaires to buy the presidency in order to protect their power and profits could undoubtedly impact us all. Miriam Adelson is worth a staggering $27.5 billion , a fortune she shared with her late husband, Sheldon Adelson, the casino mogul and GOP megadonor who died in 2021. The Adelsons have shelled out hundreds of millions of dollars over recent decades. As ardent Zionists, few causes have been closer to their hearts than supporting Israel. While alive, Sheldon Adelson, a staunch backer of war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu and the expansion of Israeli settlements in Palestine, deeply influenced the Trump administration’s Israel policy, including the decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. With Miriam in charge of the family fortune, nothing has changed. The New York Times decsribes her as “a political carbon copy of her husband: intensely pro-Israel, rabidly partisan.” Miriam Adelson was born in Israel and is a former IDF officer. She has referred to “pro-Palestinian advocates” as “our enemies” and said “ they should be dead to us.” Adelson has promised to spend upwards of $100 million to elect Donald Trump (though tensions have emerged between Adelson and Trump after he reportedly sent her text messages she found off-putting; Trump now appears to be trying to mend the relationship). According to news reports , she wants the U.S. to support Israel’s annexation of the West Bank. A close friend says she does not support the creation of a Palestinian state. If Adelson has her way, the presidential election outcome could pay off well. Given her huge donations, few donors will have more influence over the Israel policy of a potential second Trump administration. Adelson is not alone among billionaire pro-Israel election donors. Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus , for example, who is worth $9.8 billion , is one of AIPAC’s top donors and a huge backer of ultra-Zionist groups like Christians United for Israel , the Zionist Organization of America, and the Israel on Campus Coalition. Marcus has previously donated big to Trump and is supporting him in 2024. There’s a special kind of billionaire whose desire to intervene in politics goes beyond direct material interest, though that certainly exists. These billionaires have superhero complexes, imagining themselves as real-life Bruce Waynes or Tony Starks, who, by virtue of their purported business success and self-professed brilliance, should have a larger platform to speak to the world and more access to influence it. Enter Elon Musk. Musk may be the world’s most famous billionaire. The founder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX is worth an astonishing $221 billion . On top of that, he also owns X (formerly Twitter), one of the world’s biggest social media platforms. It’s not entirely clear what motivates Elon Musk. He’s a fan of conspiracy theories and flirts with the far-right. He regularly tweets out childish memes and kernels of Muskian wisdom that mostly bash so-called “wokeness” and immigration policy and trans rights. He wants to colonize Mars, and his ego is about as big as the red planet. To be sure, there are other self-fashioned billionaire Supermen, ranging from the anti-DEI Bill Ackman to the world health savior (except on vaccines ) Bill Gates. But Musk may take the cake. Musk has not veered too far into politics — though he’s previously made smaller donations to or voted for Democrats like Hillary Clinton , Obama , and Biden — but now that’s changing. He endorsed Donald Trump in July and pledged $45 million a month, until the November election, to a pro-Trump PAC. In May, the Wall Street Journal reported on the “growing alliance” between Trump and Musk and said Trump, if elected, was “weighing an advisory role” for Musk in his administration. Musk met with Trump at billionaire Nelson Peltz’s Palm Beach estate, where he discussed a plan to “invest in a data-driven project to prevent voter fraud,” and he recently interviewed Trump on X. Greater influence for Musk could spell many things. In addition to having a freer hand to promote conspiracies and far-right ideas , Musk is a notorious union buster who wants to destroy the National Labor Relations Board. Recently, the United Auto Workers filed charges with the NLRB against Musk and Trump for threatening workers when, during Musk’s recent interview with Trump on X, Musk laughed at Trump’s celebration of Musk’s anti-union stance. Cryptocurrency is a polarizing topic, with its backers and detractors alike, but one thing is certain: its growing popularity has bolstered a slew of billionaire profiteers who are now intervening in electoral politics to advance their crypto-wealth. Perhaps the most noteworthy public figure and big donor from the crypto world has been the now-disgraced and imprisoned Sam Bankman-Fried, who was a huge Democratic donor. Now, with new crypto-billionaires upset over the Biden administration’s regulatory efforts of the industry — with particular animus focused on the SEC head Gary Gensler — many are turning toward backing Trump, who recently told a crypto industry conference that he’s be the first “ crypto president ” and that he’d fire Gary Gensler. Enter the billionaire Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler , worth $2.7 billion each. The Winklevoss twins are cofounders of the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini. In June 2024 they announced that each of them had donated $1 million to Trump — and in Bitcoin no less. Regulators and courts have forced Gemini to pay tens of millions and settlements in fines because of unsafe and unsound practices, so it’s no wonder the Winklevoss twins want to put more crypto-friendly officials in power. To be sure, the Harris campaign is also now trying to make inroads with the crypto industry, having launched a “ Crypto for Harris ” campaign. The Winklevoss twins have also thrown money into Arizona races across the political aisle . One thing’s for sure: with crypto barons increasingly seeking to influence national politics, and with all sides reaching out to the industry, powerful insiders stand to gain influence in any new administration that will be tasked with overseeing a volatile and uncertain industry whose crashes can have wide repercussions . No sector throws money in politics like Wall Street. The billionaires who dominate the financial industry are some of the heaviest hitters when it comes to backing politicians and parties they wish to curry favor with. Stephen Schwarzman, perhaps the most influential Wall Street baron of our time, is a case in point. The cofounder, chairman and CEO of the Blackstone Group, the world’s largest private equity firm, is worth nearly $40 billion . While Schwarzman is known for his outlandish birthday parties and global collection of mansions , as well as among the world’s biggest landlords and a fossil fuel profiteer, he’s also made a splash through donating tens of millions of dollars into politics. Schwarzman has spent millions backing his friend Donald Trump, and he served as a top economic advisor to Trump during his presidency. While Schwarzman disavowed Trump in 2022, he crawled back to support him in 2024. Other Wall Street billionaires who disavowed Trump after the January 6, 2021 capital insurrection, like Nelson Peltz and Bill Ackman, are also backing him now. What could be behind this turnabout? As one private equity executive anonymously told the Financial Times : “We’ll get richer if he wins.” But Wall Street will get rich no matter who wins, and they’re also backing Democrats. Billionaire backers of the blue presidential ticket include financial titans like Michael Bloomberg, Seth Klarman, Roger Altman, and many others . Even Schwarzman’s right hand man, Blackstone president Jonathan Gray , backs Harris. That the two top leaders of the world’s single richest private equity firm each back a separate candidate could tell us something: no matter who prevails in November, Wall Street will be a winner. What billionaires decide to do with their vast coffers of wealth — whether that be building philanthropic empires, holding localities hostage for sports stadium subsidies, making flight attempts to outer space, or throwing millions into politics to shape elected leadership and policy agenda — impacts us all. Taking on billionaire power is not an easy task, but fortunately, there are growing, vibrant coalitions doing just that. One example is the #AllEyesOnYass coalition that is exposing and challenging the power of Jerrfey Yass, the powerful Pennsylvania-based billionaire mentioned above who is leading the elite effort to dismantle public education. And here the good news: if you want to get started taking on billionaire power where you live, work, or go to school, you can check out the recent LittleSis training webinar on “Researching Billionaires and Other Powerful People,” and sign up for further power research trainings here .
How will the UK government respond to this assault by the world’s wealthiest and most powerful online troll? How will the UK government respond to this assault by the world’s wealthiest and most powerful online troll? Late last week, Jonathan Freedland, one of the U.K.’s top political commentators, wrote an article in The Guardian calling out billionaire Elon Musk as a cheerleader for the pogrom-like anti-immigrant riots then sweeping the country. “He is surely the global far right’s most significant figure,” Freedland wrote of Musk, “and he holds the world’s largest megaphone. As he may put it, a battle to defeat him is now inevitable — and it has to be won.” A few days later, Bruce Daisley, a former Twitter vice president for Europe, called for Musk to be indicted for incitement. He also called for implementation of the U.K.’s Online Safety Act of 2023 , which was designed to protect children while they are online and to detail a set of responsibilities for social media companies, to be rolled out faster, and for the legislation to be updated to make it easier for the government to prosecute top-tier social media executives who either skirt their responsibilities to tame the spread of misinformation or actively take part in that misinformation game. “The question we are presented with,” Daisley wrote recently in The Guardian , “is whether we’re willing to allow a billionaire oligarch to camp off the U.K. coastline and take potshots at our society.” The outpouring of calls to tackle Musk’s outsized and destructive role in shaping popular discourse has been triggered by the business tycoon’s relentless spreading of misinformation in the wake of the horrific killing of three young girls in the Northern English town of Southport two weeks ago. Arguably, no social media platform, and no social media owner, has done more to facilitate the seeding of far right lies about the events in Southport than has Musk and his X platform. In an intervention both blitheringly ignorant and reckless, even by his own increasingly debased standards, Musk suggested “Civil war is inevitable” as the far right protests gathered steam after the killings in Southport. To be clear, there is no sense of imminent civil war in the U.K. at the moment, and the vast majority of communities around the country have stayed absolutely peaceful in recent weeks. In fact, for all of the violence of the rioting, the U.K. — which hasn’t had a genuine civil war since the mid-17 th century, which doesn’t have a heavily armed civil population and which recently saw a peaceful general election and a peaceful transfer of power from one party to the other — is about as far from a fratricidal clash of warring armies as any state on Earth. It is no closer to civil war today than it was in the 1980s when football hooligans terrorized areas around stadiums after Saturday games. Moreover, while it did manage to burn a few buildings and instill terror in the hearts of thousands of immigrants and asylum seekers this month, the far right was rapidly overwhelmed by the turnout of tens of thousands of peaceful anti-racist protesters, and its violence prosecuted by the courts. That’s not, of course, to minimize the destructive impact of far right groups. Racist and fascist organizing efforts have a long history in the U.K., from Oswald Mosley’s fascist marches in the East End of London in the 1930s through to violent National Front outbursts in the 1970s, and far right football hooligans a decade later. Yet, each time the fascist fringe has made a bid for dominance on the streets, it has ultimately been successfully pushed back by an array of counter-protesters and popular front-styled opposition. When Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office responded to Musk’s bizarre civil war post with a fairly milquetoast statement saying there was “no justification” for such a pronouncement, the X owner went to rhetorical war with the newly elected leader . He accused British police of instituting a two-tier policing system that treated the far right more harshly than Muslims and other groups; posted that Starmer should be concerned about “attacks on all communities,” as if the far right rioters were themselves somehow victims; and shared videos purporting to show a British resident being arrested for what they had posted online and comparing the U.K. under Starmer to the Soviet Union. It is true that the U.K. does have laws against online racial incitement, and has arrested a few people for their posts, but those posts aren’t generically expressing a hateful worldview; rather, in the case of the two men recently sentenced to jail terms for their posts , they were very specifically advocating arson attacks by the rampaging mobs on particular hotels housing asylum seekers. Only in Elon Musk’s world would advocating setting fire to people be deemed acceptable free speech. Musk’s destructive interventions didn’t stop there. He followed up with a middle-of-the-night repost of a fake news story claiming Starmer was about to authorize the opening of detention camps for far right rioters on the Falkland Islands off the coast of Argentina. He then added to the mayhem with cryptic one-liners, such as the 5:50 am post on August 10: “It’s 2030 in the UK & you’re being executed for posting a meme…” Just to clarify, unlike the U.S., there is no death penalty in the U.K. And unlike in the U.S. — where mobs with high velocity rifles often intimidate their political opponents, librarians, public health officials and others they deem to be “enemies of the people,” and where a growing number of political figures call for their enemies to be imprisoned, deported or executed — in the U.K., high-profile calls for bloodshed are rare, especially from senior government officials. All of which begs the question: Doesn’t the world’s richest man have anything better to do before his first cup of coffee in the morning than author inane, false and inflammatory posts aimed at stirring up fear and hatred in a country that has just experienced a traumatic week of far right violence? If Musk had even a modicum of decency, he would explore the role that his own platform might have played in fomenting the hate spree by boosting the reach of figures such as Tommy Robinson, founder of the fascist English Defense League , whom Musk re-platformed after buying Twitter in 2022. Once something of an iconoclast, Musk has, over the past few years, become an unapologetic advocate of the far right worldview. How will the U.K. government respond to this assault by the world’s most noxious — and powerful, and wealthy — online troll? Under the previous Conservative government, Musk got a free pass, despite his increasingly erratic statements and his use of X to foment far right movements globally. Indeed, then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak sat down with Musk for a one-on-one live-streamed conversation just a few months before the July general election. Now, however, calls are growing to use the U.K.’s legal system to rein in X and its billionaire owner. Some have argued for restricting access to X in the U.K., though this hasn’t picked up traction in government circles. More likely, U.K. social media users who are alienated by X’s far right drift will increasingly use their power as consumers to look elsewhere; indeed, in the wake of Musk’s intervention in U.K. politics, Bluesky, an alternative to X, saw a surge in usage in Britain . Meanwhile, Starmer has warned social media executives that when racist mobs are whipped up online, the companies are letting crimes be committed “on your premises.” The subtext was that the government would — or at least could, when push came to shove — be willing to potentially prosecute companies and their executives for not policing their own sites effectively. Whether or not the U.K. government ultimately chooses to prosecute Musk, it seems a Rubicon has been crossed this past week. One of the world’s richest and most powerful men has used his social media reach to exacerbate chaos in a country battered by days of far right violence. Freedland is right: It has now become time to take on Musk and his awful brand of politics.
Musk and Trump have long histories of hostility toward labor unions, both in the US and overseas. The United Auto Workers announced Tuesday that it filed federal labor charges against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk after the former president heaped praise on the world’s richest man for firing striking workers. During a rambling and lie-filled conversation on X — the social media platform owned by Musk — Trump hailed the Tesla CEO as “the greatest cutter.” “I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in, you just say: ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike — I won’t mention the name of the company — but they go on strike,” Trump said as Musk — who is backing the GOP nominee — laughed. “And you say: ‘That’s okay, you’re all gone.'” The UAW argued Tuesday that Trump and Musk’s remarks during the conversation, which was viewed live by more than a million people, amounted to “illegal attempts to threaten and intimidate workers who stand up for themselves by engaging in protected concerted activity, such as strikes.” “Under federal law, workers cannot be fired for going on strike, and threatening to do so is illegal under the National Labor Relations Act,” the union said. Listen to Trump’s comments: Trump praises billionaire Elon Musk for firing workers who were striking for better pay and working conditions pic.twitter.com/4ZGWHV49Mw Shawn Fain, the UAW’s president, said in a statement Tuesday that “when we say Donald Trump is a scab, this is what we mean.” “When we say Trump stands against everything our union stands for, this is what we mean,” Fain added. “Donald Trump will always side against workers standing up for themselves, and he will always side with billionaires like Elon Musk, who is contributing $45 million a month to a super PAC to get him elected. Both Trump and Musk want working-class people to sit down and shut up, and they laugh about it openly. It’s disgusting, illegal, and totally predictable from these two clowns.” Shortly after taking over the social media platform formerly known as Twitter in 2022, Musk terminated unionized custodial workers at the company’s San Francisco headquarters on the same day that they launched an Unfair Labor Practice strike. Months later, Musk-led Tesla fired dozens of workers at its Buffalo, New York factory just a day after they announced plans to unionize. Musk, like Trump , has a long history of hostility toward labor unions, both in the U.S. and overseas — a similarity that the pair bonded over during the X conversation Monday night. “Scab recognize scab,” the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of unions in the U.S., wrote on X in response to Trump’s remarks on striking workers. Chris Brooks, a strategist for Fain, added that “when the mighty UAW says DONALD TRUMP IS A SCAB, this is exactly what we mean.” “Listen to Trump in his own words, laughing with anti-union billionaire Elon Musk about how they both support firing workers who exercise their right to strike,” Brooks added. Both the AFL-CIO and the UAW have endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris , warning that a second Trump term would “would decimate workers’ ability to organize; gut health and safety protections; attack civil, labor, and consumer rights; eviscerate retirement security; and undermine our ability to hold the wealthy and corporations accountable.” Warren Gunnels, staff director for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), wrote during the Trump-Musk conversation that “the problem is not the dude from Guatemala picking tomatoes for starvation wages,” rejecting the pair’s demonization of immigrants. “The problem is billionaires like Trump and Musk who exploit workers, rip off the American people, and make a fortune by being conmen,” Gunnels added. “The problem is corporate greed, boss. Trump and Musk are scabs.”
During a “Spaces” event, Trump rattled off a number of policy positions similar to those found within Project 2025. After being largely absent from the platform since leaving the White House, former President Donald Trump, the current GOP nominee for president, returned to X on Monday, the site formerly known as Twitter, making a series of campaign posts and returning for an “interview” with site owner Elon Musk. Trump had made just one post on the site in his post-presidential career, tweeting his mugshot from August 2023 with a caption that falsely described indictment charges against him as being “election interference.” His last post before that one was on January 8, 2021 — two days after the Capitol attack that was carried out in his name — in which he stated that he would not attend the inauguration of President Joe Biden . Trump’s first post breaking his long drought on X was a campaign video promoting himself and featuring falsehoods about the charges against him stemming from his removal of documents from the White House upon his departure from the presidency to his estate at Mar-a-Lago, where he kept highly classified material in unsecured locations , including in his office, ballrooms and bathrooms on the property. The video featured audio of opinionated pro-Trump commentary errantly describing the charges against him as prosecutorial “abuse” and a “dangerous and unstable” moment in U.S. history. Trump made at least 10 more posts after that one, mainly additional campaign videos and promotions of his planned “Spaces” event for Monday evening, which Musk was set to host. Observers suggested more posts would be coming. “Monday’s slew of updates are unlikely to be his last, instead marking the start of a more regular presence on the platform,” Semafor’s Shelby Talcott wrote . However, as of Tuesday morning, Trump has not posted any more content on X, instead posting multiple missives on his own social media site, Truth Social. It remains unclear how often Trump intends to use X going forward, but the safe bet is to assume he will use it more as the 2024 campaign season ramps up, as it was an instrumental tool for him in his 2016 and 2020 campaigns. Trump was long considered one of the most infamous users of X back when it was called Twitter, even before he ran for president. He frequently shared his opinions on celebrities and culture in general, including political topics. Notably, he also spread political falsehoods, such as promoting the errant claims that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States , a conspiracy theory dubbed “birtherism.” As president, he continued to issue false tweets against his political opponents, such as his attacks against four congressional women of color, utilizing the common racist trope of telling them to “go back” to their supposed home countries even though all of them were citizens and only one had been born outside of the U.S. Both Trump and Musk — the latter of which has pledged to donate millions of dollars to help elect the former — hyped up the X “Spaces” event held on Monday night. However, that event was delayed by more than 40 minutes due to glitches on the platform, which Musk initially claimed had been a cyber attack of some kind , at one point agreeing with a user that Democrats might have been behind the problems, a contention that had no basis in fact to support it. In fact, a source at X indicated to The Verge that no such attack appeared to have happened , and that there was a “99 percent” chance that Musk was lying. The event itself was less of an interview, as it was billed, and more of a promotion of Trump with little, if any, pushback from Musk. Indeed, the discussion “was largely a Trump monologue, not unlike his public rallies, with Musk occasionally jumping in with friendly questions about subjects on which the two men generally agree,” according to reporting from NBC News . The Washington Post further described the questions from Musk as being “softballs.” The two discussed many topics that appear in Project 2025, a wish list of ideas from the Heritage Foundation and other far right groups that Trump has tried (and failed) to distance himself from out of apparent fears that it could scare voters away from him . In one of his first policy statements during the event, Trump called for the dismantling of the Department of Education . The former president also cheered Musk for firing his workers who went on strike. He and Musk also took turns blasting immigrants coming to the U.S. In true Trumpian fashion, the Republican nominee continued to blast his political opponents, describing them as “dangerous for our country,” and hyperbolically stating that , should his Democratic opponent Vice President Kamala Harris win the presidency, “you’re not gonna have a country anymore.” Trump also engaged in antisemitic tropes , deriding Jewish Americans who support Democratic politicians as not being loyal to Israel itself by doing so. Noticeable by viewers throughout the event was Trump’s slurring and lisping of his words . But beyond the aesthetic issues of the Spaces event, observers opined that the former president’s proposals were in alignment with some of the most extreme parts of Project 2025, adding that the characterization of the event as an interview was deeply problematic. “It’s not an interview when the person asking the questions has endorsed you and is a donor to your campaign,” CNN ’s Jim Sciutto said . “Trump is talking total gibberish and Elon Musk keeps agreeing with him, like he’s making sense. This is not an interview,” said linguist Paula Chertok . “All Trump’s Spaces did was remind us Project 2025 is his best friend,” Democratic Coalition co-founder Scott Dworkin said . The Harris campaign also spoke out against Trump’s comments during the Spaces event , writing in a statement that his “extremism and dangerous Project 2025 agenda is a feature, not a glitch, of his campaign, which was on full display for those unlucky enough to listen in tonight during whatever that was on X.com.” “Trump’s entire campaign is in service of people like Elon Musk and himself,” the campaign added, describing the two as “self-obsessed rich guys who will sell out the middle class and who cannot run a livestream in the year 2024.”
America PAC is accused of “misleading voters” because of how it collects personal data of swing state residents online. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is investigating a super political action committee created by billionaire Elon Musk that’s been accused of “misleading voters” because of how it collects personal data of swing state residents online. “Every citizen should know exactly how their personal information is being used by PACs, especially if an entity is claiming it will help people register to vote in Michigan or any other state,” a spokesperson for the Democratic official told CNBC on Sunday. “While the America PAC is a federal political action committee, the department is reviewing their activities to determine if there have been any violations of state law,” the spokesperson added. “We will refer potential violations to the Michigan attorney general’s office as appropriate.” Sharing the CNBC article on X — a social media platform formerly called Twitter, which Musk bought in 2022 — Benson said that she and Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel “take intentional efforts to mislead voters very seriously in our state.” Benson also thanked Michigan Senate Majority Whip Mallory McMorrow (D-8) “for bringing the website to our attention a few days ago.” CNBC political finance reporter Brian Schwartz on Friday had reported on the digital advertising and data collection activities of America PAC, which is working to elect former Republican President Donald Trump . The journalist detailed how people who enter ZIP codes for competitive areas are not sent to local voter registration pages, “they instead are directed to a highly detailed personal information form, prompted to enter their address, cell phone number, and age.” Schwartz’s reporting sparked accusations that the super PAC’s scheme “seems like election fraud” and calls for the U.S. Department of Justice to launch an investigation. As with the initial reporting, Schwartz noted Sunday that a spokesperson for the group declined to comment and Musk did not return emails seeking comment. After the reporter revealed Michigan’s probe on Sunday, he pointed out on X that America PAC “took down their homepage links to register to vote and request a ballot.” NEW: The day Benson's office told me they're launching a probe into the Musk backed PAC and I reached out to the PAC, is the same day the committee took down their homepage links to register to vote & request a ballot. 1st pic: Sunday AM 2nd pic: Now pic.twitter.com/HRst4AnKh4 Ben Gardner, All Voting Is Local’s Michigan senior campaign manager, welcomed his state’s investigation into the super PAC. “Good,” Gardner said Sunday. “Michiganders should feel confident knowing that Michigan’s secretary of state will stand up to those who attempt to mislead voters.”
The chance that generative AI will have an impact on the election grows as Election Day nears, says one expert. X owner Elon Musk’s reshare of a manipulated, faux campaign ad for Vice President Kamala Harris on social media last week raised alarms because he did not disclose that the clip, which parroted rightwing takes about the likely Democratic nominee, was a parody. But experts warn that the move illuminates AI’s potential to further embed distrust of election institutions in among voters ahead of the 2024 election. Musk reposted the manipulated video of Harris to X on Friday night. The clip, which used much of the same imagery from her first presidential campaign ad, featured a new voice-over that appeared to be digitally altered to sound like Harris. “I, Kamala Harris, am your Democrat candidate for president because Joe Biden finally exposed his senility at the debate,” the voice says in the clip. “I was selected because I am the ultimate diversity hire. I’m both a woman and a person of color, so if you criticize anything I say, you’re both sexist and racist.” The video goes on to say Harris doesn’t know “the first thing about running the country” and dubs Biden the “ultimate deep state puppet,” while maintaining the vice president’s campaign branding and splicing in authentic clips from past Harris speaking engagements. The viral video underscores the potential for AI-generated images, audio and videos to spread political misinformation even as they attempt to poke fun through parody or satire, an issue compounded in a highly contentious election year and by Americans’ waning trust in the nation’s electoral process. While Musk’s post is far from the first to spark controversy, it’s a sign of what role AI deepfakes can play — and how far they can reach — in sowing doubt as voters prepare for November, according to Mekela Panditharatne, senior counsel at the NYU Brennan Center for Justice’s elections and government department. “It emblematizes this period where we are seeing the burgeoning spread of generative AI and its impact on elections and the information environment,” she said, noting that similar deepfakes have become more common in the past year. While deepfakes predated the rise of generative AI, the latter allows for deepfakes to “spread in a way that is much faster,” while making it “easier and cheaper to produce more sophisticated looking and sounding content.” Because the information environment is very polarized, recognizing parody in a clip like the one Musk shared can vary greatly from observer to observer, even for content that may seem “quite realistic but should be reasonably” understood as parody, Panditharatne said. Content that might be easily or quickly understood to be parody by one type of audience may not be perceived as such by a different audience, “especially if the content feeds into their preconceived notions of what a candidate is like” or their personal politics. Oren Etzioni, a University of Washington professor emeritus of computer science and the founding CEO of the Allen Institute for AI, told Salon that the Harris deepfake ad, “to the naked eye,” was “surprisingly well done.” While frequent X users who saw the clip could click through to the original post and see the original poster disclose it was a parody, Etzioni said that with more than 130 million views, some users are bound to see Musk’s post, which only includes the caption “This is amazing” with a laughing crying emoji, and believe it to be “informative” if not “genuine.” That dynamic creates a disinformation problem that’s four-pronged, he explained. First, more and more Americans consume part if not all of their news from social media, which allows “true fact” to live “side-by-side with falsehoods.” The second is in the way people “tend to be visual animals” and react in a “very visceral way” to what they see, and the third is in the ease with which individuals can create “doctored or fabricated images, video and audio that prey on that.” “Now that combination means that anonymous users can create something that looks real and is fake, that looks compelling, but it’s not true,” said Etzioni, who also founded TrueMedia.org, a nonprofit that seeks to curb the proliferation of online deepfakes and disinformation by offering a free, online fact-checking tool. “Then when you couple that with the last nail in the coffin, which is having somebody with a wide audience and with some of his own credibility, like Elon Musk, sharing that without any warning, that’s a recipe for disaster.” Generative AI deepfakes both inside and outside the U.S. have previously threatened to influence voters either through humor, misinformation or a combination of both, according to The Associated Press . Fake audio clips circulated in Slovakia in 2023 portrayed a candidate hatching a plan to rig an election and increase the price of beer days before the vote, while a political action committee’s 2022 satirical ad spliced a Louisiana mayoral candidate’s face onto an actor who portrayed him as an underachieving high schooler. Harris’ former running mate has also been a frequent victim of the technology. Earlier this year, a deepfake robocall using Biden’s voice urged voters in New Hampshire to skip the state’s Democratic primary, and just last week, a deepfake video of his campaign withdrawal announcement appeared to show the president cursing out his critics. “The potential spread of content that disruptively depicts candidates or officials in ways that manipulate people’s perception of those candidates and officials, that undermine the election process itself — that is a very troubling prospect,” Panditharatne said, explaining that the risk for viewers of the content to be misled is greatest in the period immediately after the deepfake goes live. In addition to creating potential misrepresentations of officials, malevolent actors can also exploit generative AI to create deepfakes to bolster vote suppression by way of deceptive depictions of election officials and crises at polling sites, and manufactured obstacles to voting among other examples, which could further erode the nation’s trust in electoral institutions, she said. “That growing lack of trust in institutions and authoritative sources and information is generally a problem for elections and democracy, and the advent of generative AI and deepfakes exacerbate that issue,” Panditharatne argued. Etzioni and Panditharatne said they encourage voters to view content that evokes an emotional response with an appropriately critical lens, use or reference a credible fact-checker to verify the accuracy (or lack thereof) of the content they encounter, and engage authoritative sources of information like legitimate news media and official election office websites, in order to stay abreast of accurate information ahead of November. While Congress has yet to pass legislation regulating AI as it’s used in politics, more than one-third of state legislatures have authorized laws of their own around the use of AI in campaigns and elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. These laws, Panditharatne said, reflect First Amendment protections over parody and satire, while working to curb potential election disinformation. To aid in slowing the spread, Etzioni also recommends tagging political videos that have been manipulated by AI as such, which would allow viewers to engage with altered media from a more informed perspective. According to the AP , social media companies, like YouTube, have created policies with respect to sharing generated and manipulated media on their platforms. X also boasts a policy on manipulated media barring users from sharing “synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media that may deceive or confuse people and lead to harm (‘misleading media’),” with some exceptions made for satire and memes so long as they do not cause “significant confusion about the authenticity of the media.” Some users questioned whether Musk in making the post violated his platform’s own policy, while participants in X’s “community notes” feature, which works to contextualize if not correct posts, suggested labelling Musk’s repost. As of Tuesday, however, no label has been added. The chance that generative AI will have an impact on the election — and the resources that adversaries or malevolent actors will have to create this kind of content — grows as election day nears, Etzioni warned. “The closer the election is, the more effort they will put into it,” he said. “I think that we need to be both vigilant but also prepared.”
Billionaires have seen their wealth soar by $2.2 trillion since the passage of the Trump-GOP tax cuts in 2017. Several prominent billionaires — including the richest man on Earth — took to social media over the weekend to endorse presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump shortly after a 20-year-old gunman attempted to assassinate the former president at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. One of the billionaires was Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who took to the social media platform that he owns to declare , “I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.” The endorsement came days after reports that Musk donated to a pro-Trump super PAC and just ahead of the start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. An analyst with the Atlantic Council told The Washington Post that Musk’s endorsement of Trump garnered “the most engagement of any post on X related to the attempted assassination.” Musk also suggested that the Secret Service’s failure to detect and stop the gunman before he opened fire may have been “deliberate” — a post that was viewed 87 million times. Hours after Musk’s endorsement post went live, billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman announced his decision to formally back Trump’s bid for a second term in the White House, four years after the former president attempted to overturn President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory and sparked a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol. Ackman, who has historically supported Democrats , wrote in a lengthy X post that he had privately decided to endorse Trump “some time ago” and suggested he would offer a more thorough explanation of his decision in the near future. “I just haven’t had the time nor felt the urgency to write the post as we are still a few months from the election,” Ackman wrote on Saturday, hours after a gunman later identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire with an AR-style rifle, hitting Trump’s right ear and killing one rally attendee. Another billionaire, venture capitalist David Sacks, reiterated his support for Trump over the weekend after formally endorsing the former president last month and hosting a $300,000-per-person fundraiser for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Sacks, who declared following the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection that Trump had “disqualified himself from being a candidate at the national level again,” called the former president a “hero” on Sunday and gushed that he has “risked everything for this country.” The trio joins at least a dozen other billionaires backing Trump, who postures as a populist ally of the working class while supporting policies that overwhelmingly benefit the ultra-rich . Billionaires got $1 trillion richer during Trump’s first term and have seen their wealth soar by $2.2 trillion since the passage of the Trump-GOP tax cuts in 2017. Between December 2017 and September 2023, according to a recent analysis by the progressive advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness, Musk saw his net worth rise from $20.4 billion to nearly $270 billion — a 1,222.8% increase.
Hours after making the proposal, Musk said he would reinstate the account of white nationalist Nick Fuentes. On Thursday, self-described free speech absolutist Elon Musk proffered a new rule for nonviolent protesters: if they remove the flag of the United States and replace it with another country’s emblem, they should be required to be deported to that other country. The description of the removal of the U.S. flag alluded to protests by students at colleges and universities across the country against the genocidal actions of Israel toward Palestinians in Gaza, where, so far, nearly 35,000 individuals (more than 40 percent of them children) have been killed . Some students at these protests have removed the U.S. flag and replaced it with the Palestinian one , in a show of support for Gazans who remain under siege. This nonviolent act of civil disobedience could arguably be viewed as a form of speech. But to Musk, according to his recent posts, it warrants the complete removal of a person from the country. “Proposed law: if someone tears down the American flag and puts up another flag in its place, that person should get a free (but mandatory) one-way trip to that flag’s country,” Musk said in his post , putting it before users in the form of a polling question. “I’m not saying they can’t come back, but they have to experience that country for some period of time before returning,” Musk said in a subsequent post . The X/Twitter owner’s post was subsequently mocked by users of the site critical of his suggestion, particularly those who noted its hypocrisy. “Where Elon Musk sits on free speech today: 1. Be an actual Nazi? Welcome aboard! 2. Hoist a flag that isn’t the Stars and Stripes? You need to be shipped to that country ASAP!” wrote Justin Baragona, senior media reporter for The Daily Beast . The Nation’s Elie Mystal similarly questioned the proposed policy, asking who would get punished more under a hypothetical situation. “My neighbor has an American flag. If I tear it down and put up an Italian one, do I get to go to Italy, or does he?” Mystal wrote . “Does it matter that he’s Italian and would likely leave it up longer than if I put up a Greek one, thus deepening my violation of Musk’s anti-speech law?” Musk’s claim to be a free speech absolutist has been questioned ever since he took ownership of the site in the fall of 2022. Users on X, including journalists , have seen their content and accounts blocked merely for being critical of the site or bringing attention to some of Musk’s blunders. The site also blocked comedians using their accounts in clearly parodying ways , a recognized form of free speech, shortly after Musk took over the platform. Meanwhile, X has been complicit in blocking accounts not only critical of Musk and the site, but also of suppressive government leaders — for example, blocking accounts of Indian users who have been critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the runup to parliamentary elections in that country. Musk also attempted to sue the Center for Countering Digital Hate after the organization issued reports on how X failed to respond to hateful posts , including from accounts spreading antisemitic conspiracy theories and from users glorifying violence against Muslims and Palestinians. A federal judge dismissed that lawsuit in late March. Musk’s bias in protecting certain kinds of speech, preferring to take the “absolutist” approach only when it serves his interests or the interests of far right extremists, is all the more evident in an announcement he made on the site just a couple of hours after his “flag” proposal. In that post, Musk decreed that white nationalist Nick Fuentes would see his account restored to X, after being blocked from using the platform for spreading errant and hateful content. Following a user’s direct demand that Musk restore Fuentes’s account, Musk responded by saying , “Very well, he will be reinstated, provided he does not violate the law.” That standard seems to be one that Musk may have created on the spot. Indeed, such a rule doesn’t seem to apply to any of the January 6 Capitol riot instigators, many of whom broke the law but have since seen their accounts restored as well . The move also provides additional evidence that Musk is happy to oblige the demands of far right bigots , in a supposed defense of free speech on the site, while not holding the same standards for accounts critical of him or supportive of progressive policies.
Billionaires now control 1 out of every 25 dollars of American wealth. Over the past years in the U.S., everyday Americans have been increasingly crushed under greed-driven inflation and debt , with homelessness hitting record highs . But as this modern affordability crisis has rocked households across the country, billionaire wealth has skyrocketed — and has now hit an all-time high, a new analysis reveals. As of this month, the U.S.’s 806 billionaires are worth a collective $5.8 trillion, meaning that they control 1 in every 25 dollars of American wealth, according to an Americans for Tax Fairness report released Monday. Due in part to the 2017 tax overhaul by Republicans, led by Donald Trump, this small group has seen an explosion of wealth in an extremely short amount of time. Since the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, U.S. billionaire wealth has doubled, from an already staggering $2.9 trillion. In 2017, none of the richest Americans were centi-billionaires, meaning that they did not have over $100 billion; now, the top 10 U.S. billionaires are all centi-billionaires, according to the report. As of April 1, Jeff Bezos was the richest person in America, with $198 billion, while Michael Bloomberg was the least wealthy of the top 10, controlling $106 billion. Each of the top 10 billionaires, whose wealth springs from either finance or tech, has experienced a growth in wealth since 2017, with Elon Musk seeing an 850 percent increase. Due to this influx to the very top, these 800 individuals now collectively control 1.5 times more wealth than the entire bottom 50 percent of American households, who share $3.7 trillion between 65 million households. “Billionaire wealth doubling in just over six years is a clear signal that too much of America’s resources are flowing to the super wealthy,” said David Kass, Americans for Tax Fairness executive director. While everyday Americans pay taxes on this wealth and contribute to crucial programs like Social Security with every paycheck, many of these billionaires use sophisticated methods to avoid tax bills, with some paying effective rates as low as 0.1 percent in recent years despite their staggering gains. These tax avoidance methods are on top of the built-in advantages that the U.S.’s statutory tax rates already offer the rich — and the Trump tax cuts have superfueled the growing wealth gap in the U.S. in recent years. Some of the most impactful policies that affect individuals from the tax cuts, the report says, include cutting the top income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent, doubling the estate tax exemption under which dynastic wealth is not taxed and weakening the Alternative Minimum Tax, which was designed to ensure that wealthy taxpayers pay a certain tax rate to fend off abuse of loopholes. A modest capital gains tax on just the $3 trillion gain that billionaires have added over the past six years, by contrast, could pay for forgiveness of all student debt, expansions of Medicare and the Affordable Care Act, free preschool, and more over the next 10 years, the report says. Instead, Republicans are currently seeking to intensify the factors driving the growth of the wealth gap and push even more trillions toward the top. At the end of 2025, many of the most sweeping tax cuts will expire, but Republicans are seeking to make the Trump tax cuts permanent . This regressive policy would massively benefit the rich; an analysis last year by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that the richest 1 percent of Americans would see an average tax cut of $25,650 in one year if the cuts were made permanent, while the poorest 20 percent would see an average tax cut of $100. “The last thing we need to do now is permanently extend the Trump tax cuts,” Kass said. “Permanent extension of high-end tax cuts would cost trillions of dollars we could invest in working families and communities and would worsen the nation’s economic inequality that the latest billionaire figures so prominently highlight.”
Environmental justice advocates in Texas aren’t waiting on Biden — or anyone else for that matter — to save them. Environmental justice advocates in Texas aren’t waiting on Biden — or anyone else for that matter — to save them. In late March, Texas joined a 15-state federal lawsuit led by Louisiana to block the Biden administration’s executive order pausing new permits for terminals that export fracked gas, or so-called liquefied natural gas (LNG). Separately, according to the Dallas Morning News , Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan created a special committee to investigate President Joe Biden’s permitting freeze, which has sparked backlash from not only the oil industry and Texas GOP, but also Republicans on Capitol Hill. Texas’s moves follow House Republicans’ February passage of House Resolution 7176 , a bill that would reverse President Biden’s permitting pause by stripping the Department of Energy (DOE) of the power to approve LNG exports to non-free trade agreement countries, instead leaving that responsibility solely with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). But Biden isn’t just facing backlash from the right. More than 560 environmental, climate, health and advocacy organizations around the world signed a March letter calling on the administration to expand the permitting freeze across all federal agencies and commissions in order to stop all pending LNG exports and fossil fuel infrastructure to bring the United States in line with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) assessment that no new fossil fuel infrastructure can be built if the world is to stay within the scientifically determined safe limits of planetary warming. Even as Biden’s export pause could impact at least six export terminals currently being considered on U.S. coasts, the nation’s LNG exports — the largest of any country in the world — are still set for rapid growth. At least seven LNG projects that would nearly double the country’s export capacity by the end of 2027 have already gained FERC approvals and are under construction. One of those seven facilities is the Rio Grande LNG terminal, which has been in its land clearing, or “site preparation,” phase in South Texas’s Port of Brownsville since October 2022 — with wetlands, mud flats and sacred Indigenous lands being bulldozed in the process. That facility — along with another proposed LNG export terminal, at least two separate pipeline projects and Elon Musk’s SpaceX launch facilities — are already causing irreparable damage to an important wildlife corridor critical to the survival of the endangered ocelot. The projects’ emissions and explosion risks are already disproportionately impacting the low-income, majority-Latiné communities in Brownsville’s Laguna Madre area. Brownsville resident Bekah Hinojosa, who co-founded the South Texas Environmental Justice Network in 2020, is one impacted Gulf Coast resident who signed a letter last month to President Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm sharing key priorities that Gulf South communities want incorporated into the DOE’s new review of criteria determining whether an application for a gas export is in the public interest. In fact, Hinojosa signed the letter after traveling to Washington, D.C., in early February to meet directly with DOE officials after President Biden announced the export freeze. Later in March, she met with a separate set of DOE officials within the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management as they attended the annual oil industry conference CERAWeek in Houston. During that meeting, she asked the office’s assistant secretary, chief of staff and director to specifically include Brownsville’s LNG projects in the freeze and that the agency’s new review process incorporate an environmental justice analysis that includes tribal consultation. “We didn’t get any strong commitments from DOE officials, no clear guidelines or understanding of how long the pause might take, or what exactly they’re going to review,” Hinojosa told Truthout of the meeting. Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management officials did not respond to Truthout ’s request for a follow-up. “We didn’t get any strong commitments from DOE officials, no clear guidelines or understanding of how long the pause might take, or what exactly they’re going to review.” The two terminals, NextDecade’s Rio Grande LNG and Glenfarne Group’s Texas LNG, are slated to export liquefied fracked gas from the Eagle Ford and Permian shale basins through the Port of Brownsville. While Rio Grande LNG has achieved its Final Investment Decision (FID) and funding for liquefaction infrastructure at the proposed site, Texas LNG has yet to receive FID or begin devastating the ecology, meaning it can more easily be knocked off track. The projects, Hinojosa says, not only represent ongoing forms of environmental racism against the Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe of South Texas and surrounding Latiné communities, but also cause deleterious climate impacts: The two terminals and the Rio Bravo Pipeline would emit “as many greenhouse emissions as approximately 40.4 million cars on the road per year ,” according to the Rainforest Action Network (RAN). Moreover, according to RAN, if the U.S. is to decrease the LNG trade by 60 percent required over the next decades, as the IEA outlines as necessary to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, “we cannot afford to add any new LNG infrastructure” whatsoever. Worse, the terminals are next to a shipping channel where people fish and shrimp, just across the highway from the Bahia Grande of the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge, and only miles from Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starbase — close enough to catch debris from SpaceX rocket launches that could present an explosion risk for nearby communities, Hinojosa warns. Hinojosa, who has been fighting the two terminal projects since at least 2015, tells Truthout that her community has now thrice been effectively rendered a sacrifice zone — first by the industry and local officials, then by the Biden administration, and most recently by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, which recently approved a land swap that hands 43 acres of Cameron County’s Boca Chica State Park to Musk’s SpaceX in exchange for 477 acres adjacent to the wildlife refuge. Three groups, including hers, filed suit against the Department last week. “We always knew that FERC was going to disappoint us, and that the DOE was going to keep selling us out,” she tells Truthout , adding that she and other Gulf South activists in Brownsville are continuing to scale up their opposition efforts despite being passed over by Biden. “We need a really strong environmental justice network throughout the Gulf to continue to push back together.” “We always knew that FERC was going to disappoint us, and that the DOE was going to keep selling us out.” Hinojosa is working closely with Christopher Basaldú of the Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe to combat Texas LNG’s plans to raze Garcia Pasture, a federally recognized Indigenous village and gravesite. The site contains the remains and cultural artifacts of a pre-Columbian village and the various nomadic cultures who lived there, including the Carrizo/Comecrudo. The tribe is working toward state and federal recognition, the latter of which would grant them protections under the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act and section 106 of the 1966 National Historic Preservation Act. Still, members like Basaldú point out that it isn’t for the government to determine whether they exist. Basaldú says none of the fossil fuel projects going up at the port of Brownsville have meaningfully consulted with the tribe, and he remains highly doubtful the administration’s new review process will include substantive tribal consultation — especially for tribes like the Carrizo/Comecrudo who are not officially recognized on the state or federal level. He sees the administration’s permitting pause as simply a cynical campaign ploy to regain votes from youth and other constituencies of color Biden has lost due to his support of Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. “The pause is only temporary. It’s not a humanitarian pause,” Basaldú tells Truthout . “It’s not a permanent ceasefire of the fossil fuel industry against Indigenous communities, Native communities, and poor Black and Brown communities, fishing communities, coastal communities. It’s not a permanent ceasefire in the war of the fossil fuel industry against life itself.” In 2021, an unstable global LNG market lent Rio Grande Valley organizers an assist in defeating a third proposed terminal, Annova LNG. Hinojosa says the pandemic-driven gas price plunge, combined with a Sierra Club lawsuit and community opposition, led to its cancellation. The community’s victory over Annova, she says, shows the validity and urgent necessity of the community’s continued fight against the two other on-track terminals. “The pause is only temporary. It’s not a humanitarian pause…. It’s not a permanent ceasefire in the war of the fossil fuel industry against life itself.” Still, the local movement in Brownsville isn’t waiting on the Biden administration, or anyone else for that matter, to save them. The South Texas Environmental Justice Network has gained steam in recent months, receiving grant money to support their first office space downtown while they continue to target the banks, private equity firms, pension funds and insurance companies invested in the terminal projects. Hinojosa and the Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe successfully pressured French banks BNP Paribas and Société Générale to withdraw support from the LNG projects in 2017 and 2023, respectively. They’re now setting their sights on Italian and Spanish banks Intesa Sanpaolo and Banco Santander. In addition to lawsuits against FERC for reauthorizing the projects even after their permits were initially rescinded, the group is also fighting Cameron County commissioners’ consideration to award Texas LNG with a tax abatement. Hinojosa is also helping assist a slate of candidates running for seats on the Brownsville Navigation District Board of Commissioners, who help oversee and manage businesses operating in the Port of Brownsville. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality waste investigator Patrick Everitt was among the candidates who showed up to Hinojosa’s office on a Saturday afternoon in late March to meet about the campaign’s ongoing canvassing efforts in the run-up to the May 4 election. Everitt told Truthout he’s running for Place 1 in order to platform activists alternative vision for the port. The current port commissioners, he says, see a future premised on LNG exports. “We all know that that’s not the future for us…. We want renewable infrastructure that’s actually taking carbon out and actually doing different types of climate-resilient infrastructure or other projects that include climate solutions,” he tells Truthout . If elected, Everitt says his first priorities would be reviewing the LNG terminals’ leasing agreements and looking into what kind of funding the port and its commercial fishing industry could receive for renewable technologies from Biden’s 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. In addition to raising awareness about the environmental harms of LNG, Everitt is also running to highlight poor labor conditions for current and future workers at the planned terminals. The night before the canvassing meeting, Hinojosa, Basaldú, and other area activists hosted an event focusing on changing local narratives about polluting industries at the port — including flipping the script about the so-called economic opportunities that the planned terminals and SpaceX supposedly bring to the community. Rather, Everitt and others point out, polluting industries simply use up majority-Latiné workers in the area, who suffer disproportionate rates of cancer and respiratory issues. Additionally, activists’ say Musk’s SpaceX venture only further colonizes the area, bringing increased ecological destruction and earthquakes in addition to explosion risks. “I see LNG and SpaceX as main arteries to the fueling of this blood machine.” In fact, Everitt says he initially supported Musk’s SpaceX venture at the port before the company did a bait and switch, as he puts it. “They came in saying 12 launches per year, initially … proposed with smaller capacity, smaller rockets, and then just changes up to this much larger complex, and it keeps going and going,” Everitt says. Moreover, he says, SpaceX is “tethered to the military-industrial complex. And so that’s where, for me, I am very militantly anti-imperialist. I see LNG and SpaceX as main arteries to the fueling of this blood machine.” Organizers say SpaceX and the LNG terminals are also intimately tied to ongoing border militarization and violence against asylum seekers attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border — many of whom are fleeing climate-fueled disasters themselves. “Both parties continue to throw border communities under the bus and continue to use us as a bargaining chip,” Hinojosa tells Truthout . “We’ve seen the Democrats in Texas and beyond greenlight their support for SpaceX. Locally, we’ve seen border militarization and border wall construction still happening … and the situation with asylum seekers not getting support and being brutalized by Border Patrol is just increasing. And now, just this extra layer of … we’re being left out again, and allowing the fossil fuel industry to still have these LNG export terminals and go about their day at the expense of our community.”
Musk and Trump also met earlier this month in Palm Beach, Florida, with a group of Republican donors. Last year, former President Donald Trump reportedly attempted to sell his social media website, Truth Social, to Elon Musk, the world’s second-richest person and the current owner of X, the site formerly known as Twitter. Trump made the proposal to Musk in the summer of 2023 , according to a report from The Washington Post , which cited two sources with knowledge of their meeting. The idea appeared to have been Trump’s. Although no deal was made on the website, the reporting reveals that the two have communicated much more than was previously known, particularly on business matters but potentially on issues relating to politics as well. Beyond the proposed sale of Truth Social, Musk and Trump met earlier this month in Palm Beach, Florida. The details of that meeting are murky, but there is some speculation that it involved the 2024 presidential election in some way, as well-known Republican donors also took part . Unsubstantiated rumors on X suggesting that Musk was going to endorse or donate to Trump’s campaign soon spread, resulting in Musk posting on the site that he was not planning to donate to either of the major parties’ candidates for president . Truth Social has faced problems since its inception. Originally billed as a supposed bastion of free speech, the far right, MAGA-friendly social media site has been mired in a number of controversies, including at one point banning accounts simply for being critical of Trump . Financially, the site has arguably fared even worse. In more recent reports on its performance, Truth Social announced that it lost tens of millions of dollars in the first nine months of 2023 alone . Meanwhile, according to Buffer, a site that measures social media analytics, Truth Social doesn’t rank at all on its list of the top 23 social media sites . The only thing keeping the site relevant appears to be the fact that Trump uses it as his primary social media. Although X is doing far better, Musk seems to be hampering the platform rather than improving it. In the fall of 2022, Musk purchased the site, then known as Twitter, for $44 billion (with the help of wealthy backers, including Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud ), after spending several months criticizing its rules on banning dangerous and false content. After buying the platform, Musk restored several far right accounts, including that of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones . Musk himself has also disseminated antisemitic content on the site . Despite Musk claiming to be a supporter of absolute free speech, the platform frequently suspends accounts critical of him . As a result of Musks’ leadership, X has seen its values go down significantly, with a report in January 2024 finding that the site’s worth has dropped by 71.5 percent since Musk took over .
Elon Musk was the biggest winner of the last three years, multiplying his fortune by over seven times. Since 2020, as the world was ravaged by a pandemic and corporate profits surged to levels never before seen, the richest people in the world have been profiting handsomely, adding $14 million to their collective wealth every hour in the past three years. A new Oxfam report out on Sunday finds that the world’s five richest men — Elon Musk, Bernard Arnault, Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison and Warren Buffett — more than doubled their wealth between 2020 and the end of 2023. Between March 2020 and November 2023, their collective fortunes ballooned from an already staggering $405 billion to $869 billion. Musk, the richest man in the world, was the biggest winner, with his wealth growing from $29 billion to $246 billion between March 2020 and November 2023. This is a change of over 700 percent. As these men gathered billions, nearly 5 billion people across the world became poorer in the same period of time, the report found. Oxfam predicts that the world will see its first-ever trillionaire within the next decade as long as this enormous concentration of wealth in the hands of just a few individuals continues to go nearly entirely unmitigated. Meanwhile, report authors note that it would take nearly 230 years for the world to eradicate poverty under the same conditions. The report, titled “Inequality Inc.,” was released the day before the start of this year’s World Economic Forum meeting, or Davos, in which a group of elite financial and corporate leaders from across the world will gather to discuss economic and business issues — a forum that has been widely criticized for its role in furthering elite rule and issues and inequalities caused by global capitalism. “Globally, we’re seeing the makings of a decade of deep division, between a few at the top and everyone else,” said Nabil Ahmed, director of economic and racial justice for Oxfam America and report co-author, in a statement to Truthout . “Across the world we’re seeing how ordinary folks are shouldering the shockwaves of inflation, war, a climate crisis and more. At current rates we will see the first trillionaire in a decade, while it’ll take over two centuries to end poverty — it’s unconscionable.” The report lays out a number of causes for global wealth inequality and the “gilded age of division.” The rich get richer through processes like colonialism, corporate concentration and profit-grubbing, and political capture through corporate lobbying. Corporate profits from 2023 are expected to break all-time records, due in part to the erosion of corporate taxes on a global scale . Meanwhile, the report notes, the poor are getting poorer as wages drop or stagnate, workers are increasingly exploited, and issues like the climate crisis have disparate impacts that disproportionately punish poorer populations. Marginalized populations, like women and nonwhite people, are facing the brunt of these impacts. Oxfam authors call for international leaders to take action to stop the trend of enormous wealth concentration at the top, both by focusing efforts on building wealth and resources for the working class and by reining in the power held by corporations and the wealthy. “To overcome an age of immense private power, we’re going to need a new era of public action. Governments can and should shape the market to be fairer. We need confident, assertive, dynamic regulation: including breaking up monopolies, stopping corporations from getting too powerful in the first place, empowering workers, and taxing corporations and the ultra-rich,” said Ahmed. “The contest is on — over policy, but also over paradigm.” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) echoed Ahmed’s call to action in a foreword to the report. “Each year, the movement toward global oligarchy becomes more pronounced and more obscene,” he wrote. This can only be fought, he continued, “if we are prepared to bring low-income and working people all over the world together to build an international movement that takes on the greed and ideology of the billionaire class and leads us to a world based on economic, social and environmental justice.”
“This is why we need a billionaire income tax,” Americans for Tax Fairness said. An analysis released Wednesday shows that in 2022, the wealthiest people in the United States collectively held a “staggering” $8.5 trillion in wealth that is not — and might never be — subject to taxation. Examining recently released data Federal Reserve data for 2022, Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF) found that the roughly 64,000 U.S. households with at least $100 million in wealth — less than 0.05% of the population — controlled more than one in every six dollars of the country’s “unrealized gains,” profits that aren’t taxable until the underlying asset, such as a stock position, is sold. “But the ultra-wealthy don’t need to sell to benefit: They can live off low-cost loans secured against their growing fortunes. And once inherited, such gains disappear completely for tax purposes,” ATF’s Zachary Tashman and William Rice explained in the new analysis. “While most Americans predominantly live off the income they earn from a job — income that is taxed all year, every year — the very richest households live lavishly off capital gains that may never be taxed.” That small, ultra-rich fraction of U.S. society is sitting on more unrealized capital gains than the bottom 84% of the country — roughly 110 million households — combined, Tashman and Rice noted. Most of the typical U.S. household’s unrealized capital gains are in the form of their homes, which face state and local property taxes. But 93% of the unrealized gains of America’s wealthiest are tied up in businesses, stock portfolios, and mutual funds, ATF found. As a result, mega-rich individuals such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk — the wealthiest man on the planet — wind up paying little to nothing in federal income taxes . Between 2013 and 2018, leading U.S. billionaires paid an average federal tax rate of just 4.8%, according to a previous ATF analysis . “This is why we need a billionaire income tax,” the group wrote on social media Wednesday, pointing to legislative proposals reintroduced late last year in both chambers of Congress. BREAKING: Billionaires and centimillionaires held $8.5 TRILLION in untaxed, unrealized capital gains in 2022. Unrealized gains are the largest source of income for the ultra-rich—but they're completely UNTAXED under our tax code. This is why we need a billionaire income tax 🧵 pic.twitter.com/0ewB3H05SQ Sen. Ron Wyden’s (D-Ore.) Billionaires Income Tax would tax the tradable assets of individuals with more than $100 million in annual income or more than $1 billion in assets for three consecutive years, according to a summary released by the Oregon Democrat’s office. In the House, Reps. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) and Don Beyer (D-Va.) unveiled a bill that mirrors President Joe Biden’s call for a minimum income tax for billionaires. The legislation would require ultra-wealthy households to pay a 25% annual tax rate on their income, including unrealized gains. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case backed by right-wing groups aiming to preemptively outlaw any tax on unrealized gains. The justices — with the notable exception of Samuel Alito, who was urged to recuse from the case due to his connection to a lawyer representing the plaintiffs — appeared unlikely to issue the kind of sweeping ruling demanded by right-wing organizations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ATF’s analysis found that the wealth of America’s billionaires and centimillionaires has exploded in recent years as Republicans have enacted massive tax cuts for the rich while wealth tax proposals have languished in Congress. “The cumulative $8.5 trillion of unrealized capital gains held by America’s billionaires and centi-millionaires in 2022 has jumped by more than half — or $3.2 trillion — just since the last Fed survey year of 2019,” Tashman and Rice wrote. “That increase continues a decades-long upward trend among the richest households in the United States.” To begin reversing the trend and addressing the extreme and dangerous stratification of U.S. society by wealth, Tashman and Rice argued that Congress must “curb the economic and political power of the richest households by annually taxing their investment gains — whether realized or not — just as workers’ wages are taxed now, every year, all year round.” “Without this necessary reform to our system of taxation,” they warned, “the growth of untaxed income at the very top of our economy will continue to accelerate, to the benefit of a tiny few and the detriment of everyone else.”
Blocking our organizations’ X accounts in India is another sign of the Indian government’s attempts to stifle dissent. Imagine waking up one morning to find out that the voice of your organization has been silenced. More uncanny is the fact that this suppression happened in the United States, a place we hold close to our hearts and where we believed, until recently, that free speech was valued. But that’s exactly what happened to us, Rasheed Ahmed of the Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) and Sunita Viswanath of Hindus for Human Rights (HFHR), on the morning of October 14. Our organizations’ X accounts had been blocked in India, a disturbing sign of the Indian government’s escalating attempts to stifle dissent wherever it arises. It took two days for us to learn that X had removed it, complying with a request filed by the Indian government made under the “Information Technology Act of 2000” — a capricious, ever-expanding Indian law which has already been used to silence scores of critical voices in India. Safely removed from the overt and often violent persecution which many activists in India must contend with , our U.S.-based human rights organizations had come to rely on X in our work of connecting activists and shedding light on the Indian government’s human rights violations. The Indian government and X have significantly hindered our efforts at engaging in meaningful advocacy. Having eliminated direct messaging between the IAMC and our more than 150,000 Indian followers and having blocked our posts from millions more readers abroad, X and the Indian government have severed the international dialogue that has informed our advocacy in Washington. HFHR has faced similar challenges, losing its ability to reach and interact with supporters worldwide. These actions collectively signal our targeting in an escalating global campaign of political repression, a campaign that is emblematic of India’s increasingly authoritarian government, which aims to stifle diverse international dialogues and suppress dissenting voices. The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist regime, has increasingly resorted to extreme measures to silence dissent. These range from its alleged assassination of Canadian resident Hardeep Singh Nijjar and attempted assassination of U.S. resident Gurpatwant Singh , to raiding the offices of international media like the BBC and petitioning the removal of overseas accounts of political critics . These actions, along with orchestrated intimidation campaigns against foreign academics and journalists , send a clear message of their intent to suppress any critical voice, regardless of geographical boundaries. This strategy of silencing criticism has extended into the digital realm, with X CEO Elon Musk’s platform playing a pivotal role in the Indian government’s transnational repression. At the Indian government’s behest, Musk’s platform deleted hundreds of posts sharing a BBC documentary exposing Prime Minister Modi’s role in a 2002 anti-Muslim massacre that unofficial estimates indicate may have claimed as many as 2,000 lives. Barring international audiences from evidence of Modi’s crimes against humanity, self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist” Musk said X “doesn’t have a choice” but to adhere to India’s regulations and censorship demands. But Musk’s decision to abide by local regulations has global consequences. His organization’s capitulation to India’s censorship requests contributes to a global chilling effect felt across North America, where so many Indian and Kashmiri Americans I know fear criticizing the Modi regime. “Whenever I call my family members , … we don’t talk about anything. I don’t even ask any questions because so many journalists and human rights defenders have gotten detained. We know that social media is heavily, heavily being surveilled,” said one U.S.-based Kashmiri academic in a recent Freedom House report on transnational repression. High-profile figures like the world-famous poet Rupi Kaur and Canadian Parliament member Jagmeet Singh have had their X accounts withheld in India. Meanwhile, throughout India, social media platforms are weaponized by Hindu nationalist paramilitary organizations to spread propaganda and coordinate attacks , sometimes killings of hundreds of Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities in India. Under Musk’s leadership, X has reinstated vicious anti-Muslim accounts, while simultaneously gutting X’s capacity to regulate hate speech, closing two of three offices in India , and cutting Indian X staff from 200 to 12 employees . With India producing 55 percent of the world’s anti-Muslim hate speech , Musk’s mass firings could not come at a worse time. Without staff to address the waves of anti-minority vitriol produced daily in India, violent speech will continue to wreak havoc on Muslim lives while instilling fear in those living abroad. Indeed it already is, with Indians producing a tidal wave of Islamophobic misinformation on Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and fanning anti-Muslim violence in Leicester, England , through countless incendiary and false posts on social media. In spite of Modi’s well-established role in prior hate crimes (crimes for which he was banned from entering the U.S. from 2005-2014), and in spite of the Indian government’s intimidation and harassment of India’s X employees, Musk seems to have a special affinity for India’s prime minister. “I am a fan of Modi,” Musk stated in an interview after the Indian prime minister had begun his U.S. tour in June. Musk’s growing business interests in India — which include plans for a new Tesla electric vehicle plant — may account for his praise of a leader opposed by 70 U.S. congress members, who released a letter in June that sharply criticized his human rights record. The actions of X and its owner should not be taken lightly. Musk’s complicity in the Indian government’s transnational censorship is stifling the free speech of the U.S. public. For the sake of our organizations and the numerous Indian religious minorities we represent and work in alliance with, many of whom have sought sanctuary in the U.S. to freely express their views, Musk should uphold the First Amendment freedoms he professes to support. He should restore the accounts of all critics suspended by his platform at the behest of the Indian government. This action is not just about our organizations; it’s a matter of protecting the voices and rights of a diverse and global community that relies on platforms like his to speak truth to power.
The Anti-Defamation League’s disinformation campaign should mark the end of the group’s role as a source on extremism. Pro-Israel groups and right-wing legislators are stoking new panic over antisemitism to attack targets they have long had in their crosshairs — including universities, progressive Jews and even immigration advocates — and to divert attention from Israel’s anti-Palestinian genocide. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is providing the fuel for this repressive frenzy, in the form of disinformation about U.S. antisemitism, Israeli colonialism and the ADL’s own organizational aims. It’s time for media and policy makers to stop platforming the ADL. While the ADL is often perceived as a civil rights advocate or anti-hate organization, a large set of racial justice organizations, writing as the #DropTheADL coalition, have made clear that it is not. The ADL’s record of anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and anti-Black racism stretches back to the 1950s, when it viewed resistance to colonialism and white supremacy as a Cold War threat to the United States. Its efforts to marginalize and silence leftist Jews go back even further: It was formed in 1913, in part, to prevent leftist Russian Jewish immigrants from tarnishing the bourgeois reputation of the German Jews who had settled much earlier. The ADL’s anti-left commitments have made it a useful ally for the right, even as it claims to oppose racism. Most recently, Trump loyalist and election denier Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-New York) borrowed two of the ADL’s debunked claims: that the chant “from the river to the sea, Palestine must be free” is a call for “genocide of the Jews,” and that Jewish students are unsafe on college campuses because of students and faculty who oppose Israeli apartheid. At a congressional hearing, Stefanik used those claims to propose that the presidents of Harvard, MIT and UPenn — each of whom has suppressed campus organizing for Palestinian rights — are failing to protect against (nonexistent) calls to harm Jews. The ADL is periodically engulfed in scandals that show its ethical bankruptcy. Perhaps the most shocking was the 1993 “spying scandal” in which the FBI found that the ADL had spied on, infiltrated and acquired illegal police files on thousands of leftist, anti-Apartheid and Arab organizations. Another came just last month, when the ADL’s CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, congratulated antisemite and white nationalist sympathizer Elon Musk for his “leadership in fighting hate.” That should have marked the end of the ADL’s role as a source for news and research on extremism. The ADL’s endorsement of Musk was only the latest in a series of disqualifying actions: It has taken on a new, alarming role as a purveyor of debunked claims about antisemitism and terrorism. The ADL has long set out to “ interpret Israel ” to United States policy makers without intervening. But now, as the ADL struggles against an avalanche of evidence of Israeli war crimes — and a surging U.S. antiwar movement led by largely young Palestinian and Jewish Americans — it is displaying surprising disregard for its reputation as a credible source. That should make policy makers who heed the ADL very nervous. The ADL’s turn to wartime disinformation has a start date. On October 9, Greenblatt’s petulant on-air question to MSNBC , “who’s writing the scripts, Hamas?” signaled his intent to block the view of Israel’s long-running military occupation and apartheid. On October 15, Greenblatt returned with a discredited right-wing social media claim about a global “day of jihad,” based on mistranslated Arabic and a healthy dose of Islamophobia. He repeated an unsubstantiated , incendiary claim intended to dehumanize Palestinians and justify Israeli war crimes in Gaza. From there, Greenblatt came to the outrageous conclusion that the Israeli bombing of Gazan civilians is actually pro-Palestinian, and that “anti-Zionism is genocide.” The ADL has continued to escalate attacks on reality. It claimed that a ceasefire sit-in by dozens of rabbis was a “far-left radical” event. It demanded that colleges investigate hundreds of Students for Justice in Palestine groups — often comprised mostly of Jewish, Palestinian and Black students — baselessly suggesting that they violate U.S. anti-terrorism laws and wildly mischaracterizing their positions. At a congressional ways and means hearing on November 15, Greenblatt called for Internal Revenue Service action against student groups and colleges based on these same unsubstantiated claims. As witnesses repeated a host of debunked claims about everything from attacks on pro-Israel marchers to the false “day of jihad,” Greenblatt appeared to embrace them. Taking a crack at dictionary definitions, the ADL released a video attempting to redefine settler colonialism so that the term doesn’t apply to Israel — nor the U.S., Australia or South Africa. Its easily disprovable, ahistorical claims are clearly intended to miseducate people and deny historical context to Palestinians. This effort has older roots — a 2017 ADL strategy document notes the U.S. public’s growing attention to colonialism and calls for “reframing” to combat it — but its boldness is new. The Anti-Defamation League is providing … disinformation about U.S. antisemitism, Israeli colonialism and the ADL’s own organizational aims. This risky strategy, in which the ADL is burning through its standing as a credible source, suggests that it is seizing the opportunity of war to push through long-standing political aims without much concern for the future. While the ADL has long been the only organization presenting U.S.-wide statistics on antisemitic incidents, even that is not enough to make it indispensable. A rising generation of Jewish organizers and researchers is organizing alternative infrastructure, and pushing back on the idea of tackling antisemitism separately from broader questions of racial and economic justice. The ADL’s aims are not widely understood, precisely because it is so often viewed just as a civil rights group. But looking at the ADL’s larger body of work shows that it is a conservative political institution with core conservative aims. Most immediately, the ADL seeks a repressive law-and-order culture, to dismantle progressive political organizing, and to cement U.S.- and Israel-allied geopolitical dominance in the Middle East. The ADL has a tattered reputation as a civil rights organization from decades of attacking Black, Arab, LGBTQ and progressive Jewish groups. But it has been consistent: It attacked Nelson Mandela and the global campaign against South African apartheid as a threat to Israel and the U.S. — much as it now attacks the movement for ceasefire in Gaza. More recently, journalists have begun examining and challenging the ADL’s vaunted statistics on hate. The ADL is not even succeeding in its own arena: It has said privately for years that its efforts to recruit Jewish support for Israel are failing. It suffered real damage to its reputation through Jewish Voice for Peace’s campaign to end the ADL’s “deadly exchange” program bringing U.S. police officials to Israel to trade repressive tactics. In a recent leaked call , Greenblatt laments the organization’s failure to win younger generations’ support for Israel regardless of their affiliation with left or right politics. The ADL has papered over these failures by dubiously calling itself a leading civil rights and Jewish advocate. But its move into disinformation should finally call into question the treatment of the ADL as an unscrutinized source on racism, extremism and Jewish politics. The ADL’s toxic push for anti-Palestinian genocide and U.S. repression will reverberate for generations. The electoral map has already been catastrophically shifted by policy makers’ adoption of pro-war positions weakly disguised in anti-hate rhetoric. President Joe Biden and others who have rationalized killing 20,000 Palestinians using the ADL’s grotesque claims, have already been sued by rights groups and Palestinians in the U.S. and Gaza for complicity in war crimes. The ADL cannot absolve them of responsibility in U.S.-backed Israeli violence. It’s time to break with the ADL.
“If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go f*** yourself,” he said. In a remarkable moment in an interview onstage at a conference on Wednesday, an obstinate Elon Musk hurled an expletive at advertisers who are fleeing X, formerly known as Twitter, and blamed the company’s problems on the advertisers themselves rather than his own leadership. At The New York Times ’s DealBook Summit, Musk and interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin discussed his recent posts on the platform, in which Musk endorsed virulently antisemitic and white supremacist conspiracy theories. Internal documents, according to New York Times reporting, have found that these comments will cost the social media company up to $75 million in advertising revenue, with brands like Apple, Disney, IBM, and more fleeing the platform. Musk was defiant about the company’s advertising struggles, and contemptuous about the idea that they may be leaving due to his actions as the owner of the company. “I hope they stop. Don’t advertise,” Musk said. “If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself,” he said. “Go. Fuck. Yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is.” “Hey, Bob. I’m sure you’re in the audience,” Musk went on, addressing Disney CEO Bob Iger, who has been critical of X and Musk. Sorkin went on to ask what Musk planned to do about the advertising and revenue crisis that the company is facing. Musk deflected blame, saying that the company’s precipitous fall in his past year of owning it is the fault of advertisers, instead of the litany of decisions that he has made and bigoted stances he has taken that have been cited as concerns by the steady stream of advertisers who have left the company over the past months. “What this advertising boycott is going to do is, it’s going to kill the company,” he said. “And the whole world will know that those advertisers killed the company. And we will document it in great detail.” Sorkin then pointed out that the advertisers who have left the platform since Musk’s takeover — of which there are hundreds , if not thousands — would say that the downfall of the company was the fault of Musk and his leadership team. But Musk repeatedly doubled down on his assertion that nobody else would see it that way. “They’re going to say, Elon, that, ‘you killed the company because you said these things, and they were inappropriate things,’ and they didn’t feel comfortable on the platform, right? That’s what they’re going to say,” Sorkin said. Musk, interrupting the end of Sorkin’s statement, jumped in, saying: “And let’s see how Earth responds to that. We’ll both make our cases and we’ll see what the outcome is.” The interview garnered widespread ridicule online , with people saying that the expletive and exchange were indicative of yet more poor business decisions made by Musk — like telling advertisers to continue to leave the platform as that very move is seemingly destroying the company. Business analysts are already predicting that Musk’s tirade onstage will cause even more advertisers to flee. Later in the interview, Musk — one of the wealthiest men on Earth — also criticized the idea of unions. He said, perhaps ironically , that he “doesn’t like anything that kind of creates a lords and peasants sort of thing,” which he claimed is caused by unions, rather than perhaps the current system of billionaire lords who exercise near-total power over the U.S. and the working class people struggling within it.
Many major companies have paused or stopped advertising on the platform in recent weeks. Elon Musk, the owner of X (formerly known as Twitter) may have cost the company tens of millions of dollars in lost advertising revenue due to his recent comments endorsing an antisemitic and racist conspiracy theory, internal documents show. According to The New York Times , these documents find that the social media platform could lose as much as $75 million from advertising by the end of this year, with large companies like Apple, IBM and Disney pulling ads and others like Airbnb, Amazon, Coca-Cola, Microsoft and Netflix cutting back, pausing, or considering stopping their advertising campaigns on the platform. The documents suggest that the company is struggling even more with revenue than previously reported, more than a year after Musk bought the company. The company has already reportedly been losing a large amount of ad revenue after the company made moves like removing user verification from the platform and seemingly easing up dramatically on moderation, which some reports have found have allowed a deluge of hateful content to flourish. The Times report comes after Musk endorsed a version of the virulently hateful “great replacement theory” in tweets earlier this month. In a post on November 15, an X user wrote, “Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. ​​I’m deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don’t exactly like them too much.” Musk agreed with this post in a reply, saying , “You have said the actual truth.” He followed up by saying that “The unjustly attacks the majority of the West, despite the majority of the West supporting the Jewish people and Israel. This is because they cannot, by their own tenets, criticize the minority groups who are their primary threat. It is not right and needs to stop.” (A leader of the ADL, a vehemently Zionist organization , initially criticized Musk for the comment but turned around and defended him just two days later when Musk went on to denounce the anti-Zionist movement.) Musk’s comments were widely and strongly condemned , with some commentators noting that it was one of the most openly antisemitic comments that the powerful right-wing billionaire has made in public. However, the posts may not have been entirely surprising, as Musk has been making other comments in recent months that have also hinted at his support of great replacement theory. The initial user’s post, as well as Musk’s follow up about the “threat” of “minority groups,” perpetuate a bunk conspiracy theory that Jewish and non-white communities are threatening to destroy and replace white populations in countries that have historically been majority-white. The theory has deep roots in white supremacy, and has become more popular among the right in recent years as the Republican Party has spiraled further into fascist, Christian nationalist extremism. At the same time, Musk has embroiled X in a legal battle with media watchdog group Media Matters for America after it published a short report purporting that advertisers have had their content displayed next to content by neo-Nazis, like those endorsing Hitler or the Nazi party. The report showed screenshots of ads from Apple, IBM, and other companies whose content had allegedly appeared next to such content.
Rather than block far right content, Elon Musk is suing Media Matters after their report led to advertisers pulling out. Elon Musk’s social media company, formerly known as Twitter but changed to X since his acquisition of the site last year, is suing Media Matters for America, claiming that the nonprofit media company purposefully and maliciously defamed him and the company. The suit stems from a report by Media Matters published last week , in which the organization showcased how far right antisemitic, white nationalist and neo-Nazi posts were appearing next to several big-name brands who were advertising on the site. As a result of the report — as well as Musk himself promoting antisemitic content — several advertisers, including Disney, Apple, IBM, Comcast, and others have paused their ads on X . Prior to Monday, Musk had promised to sue Media Matters for its report, saying that he would file a “thermonuclear” lawsuit against the organization . X claims that Media Matters manipulated algorithms in order to produce images to back their reporting. “Media Matters knowingly and maliciously manufactured side-by-side images depicting advertisers’ posts on X Corp’s social media platform beside Neo-Nazi and white-nationalist fringe content and then portrayed these manufactured images as if they were what typical X users experience on the platform,” the lawsuit states , alleging that other viewers wouldn’t ordinarily see such content next to each other. Media Matters President Angelo Carusone disputes X’s claims, and says he and his staff stand by their reporting. The real motivation by Musk and X is to reduce wider scrutiny of the platform. “This is a frivolous lawsuit meant to bully X’s critics into silence,” Carusone said in a statement . Carusone added : How is it the case that we are misrepresenting how often this phenomenon is occurring when we were able to document it so regularly in such a short period of time with only one researcher? Conservative government leaders have begun to laud Musk for taking action against the progressive-leaning news site, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R), who has said he is opening a state investigation into Media Matters based on the claims brought by X. But other reports have also demonstrated that X has a serious problem when it comes to allowing hateful content on the platform. A report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), for example, which Musk is also suing, found that 98 percent of hateful posts the group flagged for review on the site were still up one week later , including posts promoting Adolf Hitler as a positive political leader, denial of the holocaust, Islamophobic screeds and anti-Palestinian content. X’s policies encourage users to report posts that directly attack other people “on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.” The site claims that it does its best to remove such content, but the report from CCDH questions whether that’s factual or not. “Our ‘mystery shopper’ test of X’s content moderation systems — to see whether they have the capacity or will to take down 200 instances of clear, unambiguous hate speech — reveals that hate actors appear to have free rein to post viciously antisemitic and hateful rhetoric on Elon Musk’s platform,” the CCDH report said . Musk also promoted an antisemitic post last week. The post in question promoted a conspiracy theory alleging that Jewish people were undermining Western cultural norms and pushing “hatred against whites” through support of less-restrictive immigration policies. Musk replied to the tweet by calling it “the actual truth,” prompting condemnation from many, including the White House, which described Musk’s action as “unacceptable.” Many observers called X’s lawsuit against Media Matters frivolous, as the company has explained how it came to report its findings, and due to the fact that far right, white nationalist content is indeed proliferating on the site. “The lawsuit is “utter nonsense, of course,” Daxton Stewart, a journalism professor at Texas Christian University, said to NBC News , “but that’s the way these self-described free speech warriors operate today. The goal is to chill free speech, and we can only hope it doesn’t work.” “I’m not here to defend Media Matters but X’s lawsuit against them is a sad attempt by Musk to redirect,” media strategist Jason Kint said on the platform . Caroline Orr Bueno, a behavioral scientist at University of Maryland, also derided Musk’s lawsuit against Media Matters. “Media Matters identified a bunch of mini-data-voids on Twitter/X where problematic content lives — & then reported on it, rather than exploiting them,” Orr Bueno pointed out . She added : When you search for an obscure or rarely-used hashtag or set of keywords — like what Media Matters did, and what a lot of people are now doing on Twitter/X — you will often stumble upon data voids, or informational dark spaces (IDS). That’s not fraud. This a known phenomenon.
Of the 200 malicious posts flagged since October, 98 percent still remain, says the Center for Countering Digital Hate. A new report details how the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, has failed to address bigoted posts toward a number of groups — including posts targeting Palestinians, Jews and Muslims — since the start of October. The report, compiled by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) and published on Tuesday, examined 200 hateful posts on the site that promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories (including the promotion of Adolf Hitler as a political leader, denial of the holocaust and more), glorified violence against those who are Muslim, and dehumanized Palestinians (including posts comparing them to “animals” and denying their existence outright). According to X’s policies listed on the site itself , users are restricted from “directly attack other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.” The site claims it is “combating abuse motivated by hatred, prejudice or intolerance,” and states that it “prohibit behavior that targets individuals or groups with abuse based on their perceived membership in a protected category,” and encourages people to report such posts. CCDH decided to examine this policy firsthand, and flagged the 200 posts it identified as clearly being antisemitic, Islamophobic and anti-Palestinian, in the wake of an attack from Hamas that killed over 1,400 Israelis and the Israeli government’s retaliatory campaign that has killed over 11,000 Palestinians so far . It followed up on those posts one week later, to see if any action had been taken on them. According to the report, 98 percent of the posts were still available to access , meaning that only four of the posts out of the 200 reported were taken down. “Our ‘mystery shopper’ test of X’s content moderation systems — to see whether they have the capacity or will to take down 200 instances of clear, unambiguous hate speech — reveals that hate actors appear to have free rein to post viciously antisemitic and hateful rhetoric on Elon Musk’s platform,” Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the CCDH, said to The Daily Mail regarding his organization’s findings . X has in the past denied the findings of similar reports from CCDH, and filed a lawsuit against the group this past summer. Claiming “continued progress” on the platform when it comes to countering hate, X said in its lawsuit that CCDH “and its backers have been actively working to assert false and misleading claims encouraging advertisers to pause investment on the platform.” The assertions from X are clearly wrong, Ahmed suggested in comments to The Daily Beast , noting that Elon Musk, when he initially purchased the site, promised an improvement from what had previously existed on Twitter but that, instead, things have worsened since he took ownership of the platform. “Musk has allowed X to descend into precisely what he promised it wouldn’t into, which is a hell-scape of hate and disinformation,” Ahmed said. “What’s online leads to real-world harm.”
Seeing progressive policies succeed in San Francisco, the billionaire class is now waging a war against working people. There’s a narrative about San Francisco that is as persistent as it is incorrect: The city’s post-pandemic struggles are the result of progressive policies run amok. This was certainly the sentiment behind billionaire Elon Musk, who reportedly lives in Texas, calling for me, a democratically elected representative in San Francisco, to be “ fired .” His post on X, formerly Twitter, alleged that I was arguably the person “most responsible for the destruction of San Francisco.” In late September, he wrote that I “ should go to prison .” If one believes the constant drumbeat from the billionaire class, socialist policies and ideas are standing in the way of a safe, affordable and well-functioning city. But this is a classic case of projection. The reality in San Francisco is that a combination of the real estate industry, large tech companies and billionaire venture capitalists have driven massive inequity here, leaving the overwhelming majority of people unable to afford the cost of living. This has resulted in mass displacement of low-income communities and persistent homelessness. The latest installment of this story, however, is not widely recognized. A global pandemic sparked the adoption of many progressive policies, but when these policies started working, billionaires lashed back ferociously. That’s what we’re seeing right now. The very solutions — federal, state and local — that were working in a crisis to save lives, extend a hand to those in need and improve our city have been falsely declared failures in a self-serving effort by the rich to prevent fair taxation and a more equitable society. In 2020, San Francisco was among the first cities to shut down in the face of the pandemic. We did some things right, especially in our public health response. We also took some major steps — mostly out of necessity — that progressives have been urging for years. To put it simply, they worked. We banned evictions and launched unprecedented rent relief programs , resulting in the lowest pandemic eviction rate of any city in California. We funded workers with a “ Right to Recover ” to provide income while recovering from illness. We offered free health care connected with COVID-19, including vaccines, boosters and testing for everyone. We opened the city’s first safe consumption site which helped 400 people per day, moving drug use off the streets and reversing hundreds of overdoses. We rented hotel rooms at shelter-in-place hotels and moved those experiencing homelessness from the streets to safety, something first piloted in my district. We purchased buildings for supportive housing at unprecedented rates. As a result, unsheltered homelessness decreased by 15 percent, and overall homelessness dropped by 3.8 percent. In a global pandemic, when our mass shelters were shut down, San Francisco was one of the only cities in California where homelessness decreased — at least, until the billionaire backlash. Importantly, we taxed the richest of the rich to do this. In the middle of a pandemic, when pundits warned that no taxes would pass, voters overwhelmingly passed taxes on big corporations and billionaires to fund basic human needs like housing and health care. Our progressive taxes have raised hundreds of millions of dollars and saved San Francisco from deficits for three straight years during the pandemic. Make no mistake about it: These advances toward a more equitable city were a major threat to some interests. The billionaire class saw what was happening: Voters were willing and eager to tax the rich to fund social programs that were working. Even their millions of dollars donated to campaign committees weren’t working to stop left candidates and progressive taxation. In response, they launched the all-out political and media offensive that we’re witnessing now. Billionaire investor Michael Moritz epitomizes the problem. He’s poured millions into his own “ news ” site to produce political hit pieces and celebrate reactionary policies, created countless bogus “ civic organizations ” that are the list-building part of the echo chamber, and funded toxic political action committees that engage in little more than character assassination and disinformation. Moritz, and billionaires like Musk, Bill Oberndorf and Jason Calacanis, are attempting a hostile takeover of San Francisco. They want a government that works for the rich and nobody else. San Franciscans are living the impact. The real estate industry, venture capitalists, tech billionaires and conservative interests sprung to action after the first two years of the pandemic to reverse the successes of progressive initiatives. Here’s what they and their political allies have done: They recalled a reform district attorney, massively increased police budgets to ramp up the war on drugs , and launched a campaign to arrest people for drug use . Crime hasn’t gone down, overdoses have increased , and in neighborhoods like the Tenderloin, shootings have gone up and become more brazen as drug markets are disrupted with no comprehensive plan. They blocked affordable housing that could be housing thousands of working-class San Franciscans, refusing to spend money raised by voters and appropriated by the Board of Supervisors to fund acquisition of housing for community land trusts, limited equity co-ops and other forms of affordable housing. As a result, working people continue to leave San Francisco in search of affordable homes. They cut tens of millions from the San Francisco-Marin Food Bank’s budget and allowed the slashing of food security payments that were nearly $300 per month to under $30 per month, impacting 100,000 San Franciscans, and causing hunger and desperation for families across the city. They shut down the sole overdose prevention site in our city without a replacement. Since it was shut down, drug use on United Nations Plaza and around the site has gotten much worse, and San Francisco’s overdose fatalities have surged . There’s a pattern here. Evidence-based solutions were working and voters were willing to keep taxing the rich to fund them. So the billionaire class launched multimillion-dollar misinformation campaigns. In place of proven solutions, they are pushing a war on the poor, and predictably, homelessness, crime and drug overdoses are increasing. Policies that punish the poor and deny people their basic needs are the cause, not the solution, of our current problems, and the last few years prove it. We know what works, and we need more of it: Supportive housing for those experiencing homelessness. Investments in things that actually keep communities safe, rather than just giving unlimited money to police with no accountability. Overdose prevention sites to lower overdose deaths and connect people to the help they need, including drug treatment. Public investment — soon through a public bank — in affordable housing, small business and green infrastructure. And yes, further taxation of the rich who remain significantly undertaxed in our society. These things freak out the billionaires, but they work, and no amount of corporate spin will change that.
Since buying the platform last year, Musk has made the site increasingly hostile to journalists. Elon Musk’s X, formerly known as Twitter, has removed headlines from article previews in posts on the platform, placing a huge barrier on access to news and information from media outlets in the right-wing billionaire’s latest attack on journalism. For many users, links to news articles on the website now look similar to a post with an image attached, but with small text showing the domain of the linked article in the bottom left corner. Users can still access the article by clicking on the image, but the headlines and subheadlines are now stripped from the preview, rendering many posts from news outlets, journalists, and other users confusing and without context. Non-news websites are also affected by the change, but advertisements are still appearing in the old format, some reports have found. Musk wrote on the platform on Tuesday that the company is trying to capture users’ attention and take traffic away from other sites, and is encouraging users to instead “post content in long form on this platform” — something that only users who pay for the subscription service can do. This would take attention away from reputable news outlets with professional reporting, and move it onto X, where right-wing users have been heavily amplified and disinformation is rampant. For now, journalists are figuring out ways around the change, like posting a screenshot of the article headline and subheadline and including the link in the post text. But the platform is becoming increasingly hostile to journalists after once being a valuable resource for reporters, news outlets, political organizers, and other users looking for trustworthy information before Musk took over one year ago. Musk has been teasing the change for months, and claims that it is for aesthetic purposes. “This is coming from me directly,” he tweeted in August . Experts have cast doubt on that claim. “Although Elon Musk has framed this as a decision informed by aesthetic considerations, it can be seen as part of a larger trend toward making Twitter/X more difficult for news organizations to use,” Cardiff University journalism professor Karin Wahl-Jorgensen told The Washington Post . “It is likely to have a significant adverse impact on click-through rates, because platform users will no longer have the necessary context to understand the content of links — and therefore little reason to click on them.” Musk has spent the last year gutting the platform, making major changes that have affected journalists’ and news outlets’ ability to operate and connect with audiences. He has removed the feature that enabled users to verify their identities, which was once useful for determining reputable sources for news. The platform now prioritizes engagement with posts, something that news outlets struggled with even before Musk took over and that is easily exploitable by bad actors and right-wing disinformation peddlers. The right-wing billionaire, who said this week that he “almost never read legacy news anymore,” has also spent a considerable amount of time feuding with and demonizing the media directly. In April, he picked a public fight with NPR , calling for it to be defunded after the website, then known as Twitter, misleadingly labeled the outlet as “state-affiliated media.” That same month, he removed the verification check of The New York Times after calling it “propaganda” for the false belief that the news outlet is biased against the right. These personal disagreements seem to be governing many decisions when it comes to the way the social media platform serves users content. In August, the website briefly throttled traffic to websites that Musk had previously singled out as competitors or simply outlets he didn’t like, including Facebook, Instagram, Substack and Bluesky as well as Reuters and The New York Times . As Musk makes increasingly desperate moves to regain the revenue he’s lost, users have observed other changes, like posts about breaking news no longer being served on feeds in favor of posts with more engagement — changes that some observers have said may be signaling the end of the platform as a useful tool for journalism.
“ Musk is kind of an unsubtle example of the problem with Tech Bros,” says Cory Doctorow. “If you’ve never tried to organize a movement without the internet, I’m here to tell you, it’s really hard. We need to seize the means of computation, because while the internet isn’t the most important thing that we have to worry about right now, all the things that are more important, gender and racial justice, inequality, the climate emergency, those are struggles that we’re going to win or lose by organizing on the internet,” says author and activist Cory Doctorow. In this episode of “Movement Memos,” host Kelly Hayes talks with Doctorow about the lessons of his book The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation . Music by Son Monarcas & David Celeste Note: This a rush transcript and has been lightly edited for clarity. Copy may not be in its final form. Kelly Hayes : Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity and the work of making change. I’m your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today, we are talking about how Big Tech wrecked the internet and what we can do about it. I think we all know what it’s like to want to be done with an app or a website. Whether we’re fed up with unchecked harassment, deceptive marketing, the drain on our time or attention, or the sheer number of Nazis on a platform, I think most of us know what it’s like to want out, yet still feel walled in. We may worry that we’ll lose touch with family and friends if we permanently log off, or we may need our social media reach to facilitate our activism or careers. Some of us have deleted social media apps from our phones, in an effort to curb our scrolling time, only to download them again in short order, because we just can’t kick the habit. If, like me, you continue to use platforms whose owners you despise or that you honestly don’t believe should exist, this episode is for you. Because today, we are talking to author Cory Doctorow about his new book The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation . Cory Doctorow is a science fiction author, activist and journalist. He is the author of many books, most recently The Internet Con , which he has characterized as a “Big Tech disassembly manual.” Cory’s other recent works include Red Team Blues , a science fiction crime thriller; Chokepoint Capitalism , a nonfiction book about monopoly and creative labor markets; and the Little Brother series for young adults. In 2020, Cory was inducted into the Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame. We have been talking a lot this season on the show about how Big Tech is shaping our lives and our world, and I was really grateful for the opportunity to discuss these issues with Cory, whose book offers an invaluable resource to people who want to push back against Big Tech. As Cory writes in the book’s introduction: This is a shovel-ready book. It explains, in nontechnical language, how to dismantle Big Tech’s control over our digital lives and devolve control to the people who suffer most under Big Tech’s hegemony: marginalized users, low-level tech workers and the people who live downstream of tech’s exhaust plume: people choking on toxic waste from the tech industry and people living under dictatorships where control is maintained with off-the-shelf cyberweapons used to hunt opposition figures. If we want to push back against the dystopian dynamics of the tech world, we have to understand how we got here. We need to know what we’re dealing with and what changes might upend the dynamics that currently define our experience of the internet. We have been discussing tech issues a lot this season on “Movement Memos” because I think there is a serious need for political education on this topic in our movements. With this podcast, we try to make every episode a resource for people who want to take action and change the world. I have been grateful to hear from folks who have used the podcast in their classrooms, for popular education in their organizing groups, or to help shape their own analysis. Your support and your feedback mean the world to us. If you believe in what we are doing and want to support the show, you can help sustain our work by subscribing to Truthout ’s newsletter or by making a donation at truthout.org. You can also support “Movement Memos” by subscribing to the podcast on Apple or Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts, or by leaving a positive review on those platforms. Sharing episodes that you find useful with your friends and co-strugglers is also a big help, so if you are doing any of those things in support of the show, I want to extend our warmest thanks. I love this work, and we couldn’t do it without you, so thanks for believing in us and for all that you do. And with that, I hope you enjoy the show. (musical interlude) Cory Doctorow : My name is Cory Doctorow. I’m a science fiction writer and an activist, and I spent more than 20 years working on tech policy and digital human rights, mostly with an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation, where I’m now a special advisor, but I was formerly the European Director. The Internet Con is my latest book. I write when I’m anxious and I mostly write science fiction novels. I came out of the pandemic with eight books. This is one of the two nonfiction books that I came out of pandemic with, and this one’s from Verso. It’s called The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation . And it explains how the internet became what Tom Eastman calls five giant websites full of screenshots of text from the other four, and lays out a plan for actually doing something about it. Not just things that we think will make the tech company sad, but things that might make us happy by giving us an internet that we deserve and indeed need. KH : So, how did the internet become such a mess? Given that the internet as we know it has only existed for a few decades, it’s easy to zero in on regulatory failures and other major events during that time when trying to understand how we got here. But to really get our heads around what Cory calls the internet con, we have to rewind further and talk about the nature of monopolies and the gutting of antitrust laws. CD: So antitrust law begins in the late 19th century, the kind of Robber Baron era. The first antitrust law was passed by a guy called Senator John Sherman, who’s better known brother was Tecumseh Sherman. And he really summed up the case for antitrust in a speech he gave in 1890 on the floor of the Senate where he was stumping for his bill where he said, “we got rid of kings, but now we have these kings of trade. If we would not allow a king over the daily lives that we live, we shouldn’t allow an autocrat of trade to decide how we live.” So Sherman, he was worried about companies that would get too big to fail and too big to jail. Companies that would be so big that it would be impossible to hold them to account, because even if they were bank to rights, and even if you could muster the political will to do something about them, if you got rid of them, you would leave such a giant hole in society because of all the important services they provided that they’d still get away with it. And that was the basis on which we enforced antitrust law for the next 80 years until the mid 1970s. We passed lots of other antitrust laws, the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act and so on. But when you get to the mid-seventies and Jimmy Carter, he starts to toy with this idea that comes from this fringe character called Robert Bork, best known for the adjective “borked,” which comes from how badly he bungled his presentation when Reagan tried to put him on the Supreme Court and the Senate just shredded him for having been Nixon’s solicitor general. And Bork was a conspiracy theorist who said that, like, John Sherman and all these other people who wrote antitrust laws, actually loved monopolies, and they thought they were really powerful and really efficient and that they benefited all of us as consumers, and that the last thing that we should do to enforce these laws that were written by people who were very clear about what they wanted, is to use them against monopolies. And so as a result, we then spent the last 40 years… It started with Carter and accelerated under Reagan, and then every administration up to the current one has piled onto this. We spent the last 40 years tolerating monopolies, allowing these autocrats of trade to spring up so that in every sector, not just tech, we now have between one and five companies running everything that’s important to our lives. Computers have historically been very resistant to monopolization because they have this intrinsic characteristic that is almost mystical, it’s certainly very technical, which is this thing called universality. Like the only computer that we know how to make is something technically called the Universal Turing Complete von Neumann Machine, which is a lot of words. That just means that the only computer we can make is a computer that can run every valid program. And so every program that can run on your desktop computer could also run on your printer and could also run on your thermostat, and could also run on that little system on a chip in your singing greeting card. And what that means is that historically, if you designed a computer like say an IBM Mainframe, and you were charging 10,000% margins for hard drives for your IBM Mainframe, someone could make what was called then a plug compatible hard drive, one that would just plug in, a company like Fujitsu say, and only charge a 100% margin or even a 10% margin. And as a result, tech was very dynamic. Companies would come and companies would go, and when a new company came on the scene, they could take all of the things that the old company was using to hold you prisoner, the proprietary formats for your data, the proprietary formats for storage, the proprietary architecture that the program ran on, and they could make conversion layers and tools and utilities and plug compatible devices, and they could just set you free, that you would always have these low switching costs to go from one technology to another. And that meant that tech companies, even though they weren’t run by people who were any better than anyone else, were always keenly aware that their customers were, as The Google Boys used to say, “one click away from going somewhere else.” And they put a lot of energy into making sure that their customers were happy, because they really understood that if their customers were sad, that those customers had a lot of options. And as tech got bigger… And the way it got bigger was by buying its competitors. Google is a company that made one good product 25 years ago, a really good search engine, and then proceeded to fail at everything else they tried to make in-house, from multiple social media platforms, to a video platform, to a smart cities tool, to wifi balloons. Even their RSS reader, they all went down in flames. Google just went out and they bought other companies, right? They went out and bought a video stack and an ad tech stack and a mobile stack and a server management stack. Docs, maps, collaborations, satellite photos, you name it. It’s someone else’s idea that they bought and operationalized, and operationalizing things is very important. I’m all about the care work, but to call them innovators is a stretch. And so the way that they grew was just by buying out everyone who might someday do to them what they did to the companies that came before them. And that’s what everyone else did too. Tim Cook in 2019 told Kara Swisher that Apple had bought 90 companies the year before, Apple’s coming home with a new company more often than you’re coming home with a bag of groceries. And as a result, we got this massive concentration in tech, which left us not only with few places to go, but also a sector that was so concentrated in chummy that it found it quite easy to capture its regulators, so that the things that other companies used to do that those companies did to attain scale, to enter the market, to take customers from the incumbents, reverse engineering bots, scraping, making compatible products, all of those things became illegal. The pirates became admirals and they said, “When we did it, that was progress. And when you do it to us, that’s theft.” And they managed to create something that we can think of, as Jay Freeman says, as felony contempt of business model. We’re doing things that aren’t illegal, but that make their shareholders sad. Can be made illegal by mobilizing different parts of IP law that have been distorted beyond all recognition, into a charter that allows these companies to control the conduct of their competitors, their critics, and us, their customers. KH : In The Internet Con , Cory writes: The history of technology is one long guerilla fight where the established giants wield network effects against scrappy up starts, whose asymmetrical warfare weapon of choice is low switching costs. There is perhaps no better example of a company whose dominance is propped up by high switching costs than Facebook, a platform that many of us loathe but use anyway. CD : So when Facebook started, well first they made themselves available just to American college kids, right? You had to have a .edu address to be a Facebook user. But eventually they ran out of worlds to conquer there and they decided they were going to welcome the general public to Facebook, and they went to everyone who had a social media account and they said, “you should come over to Facebook.” But there’s a problem with leaving social media, which is that as good as a rival service might be, if your friends aren’t there, it’s not good enough. You don’t use social media because the user interface is nice or you like the graphics or it has a great app. You use social media because of the people who are there. And when a lot of people gather in one place, they get a kind of inertia. I mean, anyone who’s ever, I don’t know, tried to figure out what movie to go to with all of their friend group on a Friday night knows what this is like, right? You could be arguing for hours and still never pick a movie. And so when you’ve got a couple of hundred friends of yours on one social media platform and you want to go to another, well, maybe everyone’s dissatisfied with the one you’re on, but they’re not all ready to leave at the same time and they don’t always agree on where they should go next. So Facebook said, “hey, we’re going to solve this collective action problem for you. We’re going to lower the switching cost of leaving the major platform.” Which was not good, right? The major platform was this decaying social media platform owned by a crapulent, evil, senescent Australian billionaire whose name was Rupert Murdoch. And the platform is called MySpace, and most people who used it hated it, but they love their friends, and so they stayed there. And Facebook said, “okay, well here you go. Here’s a bot. You give that bot your login and your password and it will log into MySpace and pretend to be you, and it will grab any messages that are waiting for you there and it’ll stick them in your Facebook inbox, and you can reply to them there and it will push them back out to MySpace. And back and forth and back and forth you can go so that you don’t all have to agree to leave at once. You can go when you’re ready and your friends can go when they’re ready. And if they’re never ready, well that’s fine. They can still be your friends and you can still stay in touch with them.” Now, if you tried to do that to Facebook today, they would destroy you. They would say that you’d violated Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a 1998 law that makes it a crime to reverse engineer copyright access control systems. They would say that you had engaged in tortious interference with contract, an obscure part of contract law that has now become a weapon of choice for stopping people from making interoperable products. They’d say that you violated their patents and their copyrights and their trademarks and their trade secrets. If the person who helped build it used to work at Facebook, they’d say they violated their non-compete and their non-disclosure. So up and down the stack, they would mobilize this kind of weird gnarly hairball that we call IP law to destroy you before you could even get started, because the pirates all want to become admirals. And when Facebook did it to MySpace, that was progress. But if you try to do that to Facebook, that’s theft. KH : Under capitalism, all the wrong people tend to decide what does and doesn’t constitute theft. This is a problem that comes up a lot on the internet around copyright law and intellectual property. A system called “notice and takedown” is supposed to allow people to notify a platform when their copyright has been violated so that the platform can remove the offending material or monetize it in favor of the copyright holder. But like so many features of the internet, this mechanism has often been weaponized to enact censorship and harm platform users. CD : When the internet started, it wasn’t clear what rule there should be for intermediaries who host other people’s speech, what we call content, but which we should really think of as speech. The things that you post that are expressive and matter to you, and that we have in mind when we talk about free speech and free expression and the first amendment and charter rights in Canada, and all that good stuff. It was pretty clear early on that most people, at least then, were not going to be in a position to host their own speech. That you weren’t going to run your own server and your own service that other people can log into in order to talk to you. And even today, where technically that’s much simpler, because so many people are corralled within very large platforms, standing up your own server doesn’t really matter because no one’s going to be able to hear you or see what you have to say or speak back to you unless you’re on one of the big platforms. And so Congress in 1998, they passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. That’s the same law that has this anti-circumvention provision, section 1201. It also has this other provision, section 5-12 that says, “If a platform, an intermediary hosts a user’s speech, and that speech is later accused of infringing copyright, that that intermediary will not be a party to the copyright infringement, won’t be liable for damages, won’t have to go to court.” And the damages are crazy, right? The statutory damages for that kind of copyright infringement are $150,000 per download for a civil infraction and $250,000 for criminal infractions. So even for a company the size of Facebook, it could quickly put the company out of business. And they said, “Instead of making you jointly liable for everything your users post, which would then lead to the circumstance where anyone who wanted to host speech for third parties would have to somehow discover whether or not that message that you posted saying, ‘hey guys, what movie should we see this Friday?’” Infringed copyright before they made it public, which is sort of full employment for every copyright lawyer that ever lived or could be trained. They would just say, “Look, if someone ever calls you out or sends you an email, and accuses one of your users of infringing their copyright, provided that you expeditiously remove that content, you won’t be a party to the copyright infringement.” And that may seem like a happy medium. And there are some ways in which it’s okay, it has ended up turning into a kind of thermonuclear weapon that can be used against speech. So you have things like reputation management firms, who are really reputation launderers who work for torturers and murderers and corporate criminals, and they scrub the reputations of these people in part by writing to the search engines and saying, “The material that you’ve indexed that contains a truthful account of my client’s misdeeds, infringes my copyright, and I require you to de-list it from the search engine.” Often the newspaper or the blogger or whoever has written the thing that they’re objecting to never even finds out that one of their many articles has been de-listed from Google, so that material just goes down the memory hole. When it comes to creative workers, it’s very bad indeed. So YouTube operates a kind of notice and take down service on steroids, what’s sometimes called a notice and stay down service, where a notification that something infringes copyright can result in all copies of it being taken down immediately and all future copies being prevented from being posted. This system that Google runs for YouTube is called Content ID, and the way that it works is you upload some sound file and you say, “If this sound file is contained in any video that anyone posts to YouTube, I require you to remove it.” Or alternatively, you can say, “I require you to demonetize it,” or, “I require you to put ads on it and give the ad revenue to me. I’m going to take the ad revenue.” And so this has been a disaster for all kinds of performers. Obviously people who make documentary films that include excerpts from other films or music that they’re talking about, if they’re musicologists, this is very hard on them. A scholarly conference that live-streamed an eight-hour live stream, and during the lunch break, there was some licensed music played in the hall that was licensed to play in the hall, but not live stream, resulted in the entire video’s audio being removed permanently so that no one can hear anything that happened in this learning conference. And if you’re a classical music player or performer, you have a very good chance of Sony Records taking down your performance, because Sony owns this giant library of classical music performances, and to the YouTube algorithm, anything that you play on your piano or cello or whatever is going to sound enough like a Sony recording that it will be taken down. And Sony has been prone in past and today to, when someone contests that take down, to insist no, that this really does infringe their copyright even when it doesn’t. And then the worst of all is where you have creative workers who rely on YouTube for their income, either directing people to their Patreon or collecting ad revenue or doing something else like music teachers who drum up students by offering free lessons online. And you have predators who will send in bogus copyright claims against that person. And on YouTube, if you get three copyright claims, your account is removed permanently and you can’t open a new one. And they send two of these bogus claims so that you are one claim away from losing your livelihood on YouTube forever. And then they privately message you and demand ransom, and they say, “If you don’t pay them, they will send in that third claim, and the giant machine that is YouTube customer service will never hear your pleas, and you’ll be out of business.” Authoritarians would like an internet where disfavored speech is not permitted, and where people who say disfavored things can be identified and punished. And this has, broadly speaking, been the goal of the entertainment companies since 1996. And that’s when Bill Clinton’s copyright czar, a guy called Bruce Lehman who’d been the head of copyright for Microsoft and then rotated into government service, went to Al Gore’s information superhighway hearings, the National Information Infrastructure hearings, and proposed something very similar to this. Gore laughed him out of the room. Gore’s a kind of a mixed bag politically. I think his environmental message is fine, but there are other areas I disagree with him with. But this was a good deed he did in laughing Bruce Lehman out of the room. And after he laughed Bruce Lehman out of the room, Bruce Leman got the last laugh. He went to Geneva where the UN World Intellectual Property Organization meets. This is a thoroughly captured technical agency of the UN that has the same relationship to stupid internet law that Mordor has to evil and Middle Earth. It’s where it all originates from. And he got them to pass the internet treaties, the WIPO Copyright Treaties and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaties, that were then brought back to the US as a treaty obligation and turned into the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that law that we’ve been talking about where we find the prohibition on reverse engineering, and the notice and takedown system. KH : One of the reasons I really appreciated Cory’s book is that, while I am very concerned about the tech industry and how it’s shaping our world, I am not a tech person. It’s a subject that interests me, but when well-meaning people try to explain particular problems or concepts to me, I can easily get lost. Books have been my greatest resource in trying to understand the tech industry, and the books I have found most useful come from authors who make tech speak legible to people like me, who are nerds of a different variety. In The Internet Con , Cory talks about how most of us aren’t really wired to process the ins and outs of internet standards and regulations, and how companies exploit that disconnect. Cory writes: All this stuff — standardization meetings and forensic examinations of firewall errors — is supremely dull. It combines the thrill of bookkeeping with the excitement of Robert’s Rules of Order . Merely paying attention to it is a trial, and many of us are literally cognitively incapable of tuning into it for more than a few minutes before our minds start to wander. It is precisely because this stuff is so dull that it is so dangerous. Cory calls the insulation from scrutiny that all of this dull content creates for tech companies a “shield of boringness.” CD : That’s a phrase I stole from the wonderful comics artist Dana Claire, who writes this great series of comic books about a little girl and her unicorn. And the unicorn can be seen by grownups, but grownups don’t notice the unicorn because the unicorn exudes a thing that she calls the shield of boringness. And the shield of boringness is just this thing that makes your eyes glaze over when you contemplate it. And as a result, nobody finds it remarkable that the unicorn is there. And so much of tech policy is so eye watering and dull and technical, and difficult to understand, that over and over again, these things that are incredibly powerful and important and will have a profound impact on how you live your life, just get turned into these dull technical debates that disappear into the halls of the most technocratic weirdos and freaks like me, and normies never get to hear about it until it’s making their life miserable. So since the earliest days of the internet and even today, there have been proposals to ban working encryption. And encryption is a subject that’s boring even on its own, right? It’s a very abstract branch of mathematics. It’s hard to understand how it works. It’s full of all these technical terms like keys and ciphers and hashing and so on, asymmetric key exchanges, all of this stuff that’s very hard to understand to begin with, but encryption is incredibly important. For one thing, it’s like how you and your friends can talk to each other without being eavesdropped on. It’s how you can talk to your bank without having that information leak. It’s how you can protect the data on your computer, so if someone steals your computer, they can’t access your data. And it’s even how things like software updates for your pacemaker or your car’s anti-lock braking system can be transmitted from a server to the device, and the device can verify that it actually came from the real manufacturer and not from a third party who wanted to do something very bad and potentially lethal to you. The problem with encryption is that it works. The little distraction rectangle you have in your pocket, when you take it out and aim your camera at something and press the shutter button, if you’ve got full disc encryption turned on, in the time it takes for your phone to play that little click, click sound, that photo is scrambled so thoroughly that if every hydrogen atom in the universe were turned into a computer and it did nothing until the end of the universe but try to guess what the key was that was needed to de-scramble it, that we would run out of universe long, long before we ran out of possible keys for you to have used for your phone to have generated and to scramble that photo. And so this is very good if you’re trying to keep a secret, but it’s very bad if you’re trying to find out what a secret is, like if you’re a cop who wants to spy on someone, or if you’re a spy who wants to spy on someone. And so since the Clinton years, there has been this proposal that we should make encryption illegal, or that we should make encryption legal, but only broken kinds of encryption that we are assured by the authorities that only they can break into, and that they will only break into when they have a darn good reason. This is the first important case that the Electronic Frontier Foundation took on was over this. In 1992, we represented a cryptographer who was then a grad student at UC Berkeley called Daniel J. Bernstein. Bernstein was publishing on the early internet something called Usenet computer programs that were stronger than the one that the NSA said was all that any civilian should ever need, that no bad guy would ever be able to break, but that they could break if bad guys were using it. Bernstein argued, and we argued on his behalf, that the First Amendment protected his right to publish that source code, that computer code, and the Ninth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit appellate division agreed. But in that debate, normies were far from the action because it is such a genuinely weird and difficult to understand technical discussion. We tried to make it clear. One of the founders of EFF, an early technologist called John Gilmore, he built a computer called Deep Crack that could brute force all the possible keys that this NSA encryption allowed and therefore read everything scrambled with this NSA encryption. It cost him a quarter million dollars and it could brute force all the keys in two and a half hours. And fun fact, as I record this with you, Deep Crack is sitting about three feet to my left because John got tired of having it in his garage and made me custodian of it. It’s a thing the size of a beer fridge. And so we tried to explain to judges how this stuff worked, but their eyes glazed over. The First Amendment argument carried the day, but to this day, and even now, there are laws all over the world, including in the United Kingdom, that are pending, that say that it should be illegal to make working encryption, and you should only be allowed to make broken encryption. And explaining the nuance between encryption that works and encryption that’s broken is very hard, and yet nobody wants to get a bad software update for their pacemaker. And so it’s very salient that this stuff works, and it works as well as possible. And by cloaking this discussion in the shield of boringness, something that should be of urgent technical debate in public society in every area of our world, becomes something that is banished to the back rooms where hobgoblins like me argue about it, and you only find out about it when someone ships a bum update to your anti-lock braking system and you die in a car wreck. KH : Between the “shield of boringness” and the seemingly inescapable dominance of platforms we hate, it’s easy to throw our hands up and give up on understanding the specifics of how and why tech companies have screwed us over. But if we are going to fight for the world we want, confrontations with Big Tech are inescapable, and while most of us will never understand as much as an expert like Cory does about that world, we need to know enough to craft demands that make sense. CD : People who say that tech is busted, I agree with them a hundred percent, but oftentimes if all you understand is that tech is busted but you don’t understand how it got that way, which is a mix of policy and technology, then you don’t know how to make it better. And so you end up with these solutions that aren’t solutions. You may have heard people talk about reforming something called Section 2-30 another. Another, my eyes glaze over initials with a number at the end, because it’s technically CDA 2-30, and then no one can make any sense of. And they’ll say, “the tech platforms are publishers, and yet they get something no publisher gets, which is that they’re immunized when their users post unlawful material, and therefore we should have that taken away, and then we can hold them to account for all the harassment and Nazis and whatever that are using their platforms.” And this is just wrong. Most of the stuff that we’re worried about, racism and harassing content and so on, most of that stuff is legal to post. Making the platforms jointly liable for it won’t stop people from posting it. You’d have to change the first amendment for that. What it will do is make platforms extremely gun shy about stuff like Me Too, because they’ll be worried about being made jointly liable for libelous accusations of sexual harassment and assault. And what it will also do is stop sex workers or other marginalized groups from standing up their own servers where they can have discussions that aren’t moderated by Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, and decide what is fair and not fair in their own spaces because they will never be able to manage the liability that’s associated with it. KH : So all of this begs the question, how can we challenge or break up Big Tech? CD : So Big Tech is distinctive. It’s not the only concentrated industry. There are plenty of those. But it is the only concentrated industry where we can use interoperability to affect the power of big tech. Now, big tech has used network effects to grow. Big tech platforms get more valuable when more people use them. So every seller that’s on Amazon is a reason for a buyer to be there, and every buyer that’s on Amazon is a reason for a seller to be there. Every Uber driver is a reason to become an Uber rider, and every Uber rider is a reason to become an Uber driver. Every friend on Facebook has a reason to join Facebook. When you join Facebook, you’re a reason for someone else to join Facebook. And network effects have driven explosive growth for all of these platforms. But historically in tech, those network effects were countered by the low switching costs of interoperability. That anyone could make a product or a tool or a service that would make it easy to leave. You could make a tool that allowed Uber drivers and Uber riders to sense when both of them had a third party rideshare app installed that didn’t rip off the drivers, say one that was owned and maintained by a driver co-op. And after you set up the call with Uber, it would automatically cancel that Uber ride and rebuild it as a driver’s rideshare version. Or you could have a thing that when you left Facebook, you would go back and scrape Facebook for all the messages that your friends were sending you, put them in your inbox on a Mastodon server where you didn’t have to worry about being spied on by Mark Zuckerberg, and let you to reply to those and send them back to Facebook. All of that stuff is possible, and it means that you can leave these platforms without enduring high costs. All we have to do is clear the way, legally, for people to do this. And so in the book I sketch out a shovel-ready, two-pronged approach to making it easy for people to leave the big tech platforms, to evacuate the big tech platforms. The first is to force the tech platforms to support interoperability. In Europe, the Digital Markets Act is going to do this. It’s going to force the biggest platforms to create these automatic gateways that new market entrants, cooperatives, nonprofits, startups, community groups, government agencies and even large tech companies can set up and connect to so that you can leave a platform but continue to talk to your friends or continue to enjoy the files that you bought, or whatever it is that the platform’s using to lock you in. But that’s really easy to cheat on. The platform can slow walk it, they can break it selectively. They can shut it down and say later, “oh, we shut it down because we thought someone was hacking into it and stealing our users’ data.” And figuring out whether they’re telling the truth is really hard, because those things all do happen, right? There are hackers and people who steal users’ data, and we don’t want them to not shut down the gateway if they think some harm is coming to their users. But because everyone who understands how Facebook works is a Facebook employee, it’s going to take years to get to the bottom of those questions. And by that time, everyone who’d left for a new platform because they could continue to enjoy the stuff that they had in the old one, they’re going to have gone back because no one wants to wait years for that stuff to work. So the second part of this is immunizing all of these new market entrants, these reverse engineers, these bot masters and scrapers, from liability, both criminal and civil, for allowing users to leave the platforms provided that they don’t violate privacy law, consumer protection law, or labor law. And so we need to create these interoperator’s defenses that say that when the platform shuts down the official route, you can blast an unofficial route in there. Now, I think that that’s going to stay the platform’s hands in many cases. I think the platforms are very sensitive to how grueling and how potentially damaging it is to have to engage in guerrilla warfare with reverse engineers. It represents the kind of unquantifiable risk that leaves you doing your quarterly shareholder report and announcing that things are worse than you thought they would be, which is the kind of thing that causes Facebook to lose a quarter of a trillion dollars in one day, and for the stock portfolios of the managers who made those decisions to be absolutely devastated since they have mostly Facebook and their stock portfolios. But if it doesn’t stay their hand, if they’re reckless, and of course no one ever lost money betting on the hubris of tech leaders, then we’ll have access to reverse engineering, to adversarial interoperability. And to put some concrete flesh on those bones there, in 2012, the people of Massachusetts went to the ballot box and they passed an automotive right to repair bill that said that the big three automakers were going to have to expose their error codes to independent mechanics so you could take your car to any mechanic and get your car fixed. And that passed with a 78% majority. People really wanted it, and it had huge participation. Normally ballot initiatives get low numbers. This was a big one. Nobody wants their auto manufacturer to decide who can fix their car. So the law that was passed eventually as a result of this ballot initiative, it had a weird loophole, which is that it said that the automakers had to give error codes that traveled on the wired network within the car. And so the big three automakers immediately retooled to send all their error messages on a wireless network in the car so that it wasn’t subject to the law. Now in 2020, Bay Staters went back to the ballot box, and with a similar commanding majority passed a new ballot initiative that said basically, “For avoidance of doubt, we meant wireless too.” Now in the intervening eight years, independent mechanics would have their customers come in, they put the car up on a lift and they would say, “You know what? It turns out that this is one I can’t fix.” And customers learned that they should just go to the dealer. And bankers learned that they shouldn’t loan money to mechanics. And mechanics learned that either they worked for the big three automakers or they should change jobs. Now, Boston and Massachusetts, home to some pretty good technical universities. Cambridge has got MIT where I’m a research affiliate. If it had been legal to reverse engineer car diagnostic systems, then a couple of smart kids from MIT could have just designed a dongle with a bill of goods of like, three bucks, had them manufactured by the container load in Guang Jo, fire them at the Port of Los Angeles, truck them across the United States and sold them in Boston and across the state from which they would’ve leaked into every other state in America. They could have used them as a platform to offer all kinds of other services like warranties and parts, and things that are very high margin for the automakers, and maybe that would’ve stopped the automakers from engaging in all this skullduggery in the first place. But if it didn’t, then everyone in the Bay States and eventually everyone would’ve had access to a tool that allowed you to fix a car even if you weren’t blessed by the manufacturer. And so that’s the way that a mandate and the safety and freedom for people who want to go in on their own and do their own reverse engineering work hand in hand to produce something that’s quite durable. It’s like a two-part epoxy, right? The mandate is strong, but it’s brittle. And the reverse engineering, the adversarial interoperability, it fills all the cracks, but it’s gooey and it bends a lot. And so you put the two together and you get something that is strong and resilient. KH : Circling back to the problem of continuing to use platforms that are run by terrible people whose unethical policies and practices make us increasingly miserable, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge what’s happening at Twitter, which Elon Musk has recently renamed after his favorite letter of the alphabet. A site that had become one of the most important hubs for news and information sharing among journalists and activists alike has been devastated by a fascistic billionaire, whose actions continue to erode the platform’s utility for individuals and communities who have grown to rely on it. Many of you probably never would have found my work if it weren’t for Twitter. And yet, as important as that site has been for my organizing, my journalism, and my popular education work, I desperately want out. And I know I’m not alone, but many of us who depend on the app to reach our audiences feel unable to leave. CD : I think Elon Musk is a demonstration of the problems of collective action on social media platforms, because people are still on Twitter even though they don’t like Twitter, and they’re on Twitter because they like their friends. Now, Twitter was actually developed to be API first, to be interoperable, and the original API for Twitter is designed to allow people to leave Twitter and continue to talk to Twitter from wherever they are. We could order Elon Musk as a settlement for one of the many infractions he’s made to his existing consent decrees under the Federal Trade Commission to simply open up those gateways that are already latent in Twitter, modernizing them as necessary, and then you could go to Mastodon or any other service and you could send messages to people on Twitter and they could send messages to you. And then every time Elon Musk did something that made his users angry, they could bolt for the exits. Musk is kind of an unsubtle example of the problem with Tech Bros. But he’s just doing more bluntly what more cultured versions do in the shadows, in the same way that there’s not a lot of difference between Mitt Romney and Donald Trump, it’s just that Donald Trump speaks his mind, and Mitt Romney only says that 46% of the population are socially useless when he thinks he’s talking to fellow ghoulish plutocrats. KH : In addition to not wanting to part with friends who are not leaving the platform, I have also found the reach that my Twitter account affords difficult to part with, and I know this has been a major concern for a lot of journalists, educators, and activists, who have long relied on Twitter to get the word out about their work and projects. Personally, I have started a newsletter, and I have also dabbled with Mastodon and Bluesky in an effort to become less reliant on Twitter, because I believe our days on that website are numbered, or at least should be, but it is a struggle. Some people who have experimented with alternatives to Twitter have complained that moving from a walled garden like Twitter to a federated system like Mastodon, can be confusing – and I will admit to being one of those people. I did wind up setting up a Mastodon account after someone helped simplify the process for me, but initially, when I was approaching it on my own, I did find the complexity of the Fediverse intimidating. CD : I don’t think that Federation is intrinsically confusing. The idea that I might have an email server account at Gmail, and you might have one at Yahoo and that we can send each other email is just Federation. And it’s the same thing for social media on the Fediverse, which is, I have an account at one Mastodon server and you have an account on another Mastodon server, and we can exchange messages that way too. We can be part of a group or individuals and what have you. So it’s not that confusing, it’s just unfamiliar. And I think we should distinguish between confusing and unfamiliar. Federation I think offers enormous benefits. You’re right that there are drawbacks in terms of reach. The reach that you can get from an algorithm and algorithmic suggestions can be very powerful for freelancers and for activists. But it’s also a devil’s bargain because that reach is not guaranteed to you, and it’s often the case that platforms will give you a little of it and then take it away, and then ask you for money to boost your content. And so that’s a kind of reach that I call the giant teddy bear approach where if you’ve ever been to a carnie in the morning, you’ll see some guy wandering around with a giant teddy bear he’s won by tossing five balls in a peach basket. And he didn’t actually get the five balls in. What’s happened is the carney has said, “Hey buddy, I like your face. Tell you what, you get one ball in, I’ll give you this little key chain. You do that twice. I’ll let you trade your two key chains for a giant teddy bear.” And then that guy lugs around the giant teddy bear all day and makes people think that it’s possible to win one of their own. And the same is true when Spotify gives Joe Rogan a hundred million dollars or when TikTok uses what they call their heating tool to pick an individual influencer or person whom they want to make the platform attractive to and just send tens of millions of users their way. Rather than having those users see the content because the recommendation algorithm predicts that they like it, those users see the content because the thumb has been put on the scales by someone who works at TikTok. And the idea here is to convince some random sports bro, say, that he is the Louis Pasteur of TikTok, and that the best place in the world to be a sports bro and monetize your content is TikTok. And then he runs around like a Judas goat and he tells everyone else, “Look at this giant teddy bear I got. It’s so easy. You should come be a sports bro on TikTok too.” So yeah, those algorithmic recommendation systems can do you good, but they’re a pretty limited utility and there are lots of failure modes for them. Meanwhile, there’s nothing that says that you couldn’t have an algorithmic recommendation system for Mastodon or other Fediverse or federated products, but it’ll be separate from the product itself. So it would be something that would go off and look at all the things that it could find either on your own server or on lots of servers, and then acting for you, it would make a choice or a guess about what it thinks you would like, and put that in front of you. And some of that’s going to work well, and some of it’s going to work poorly. But what is also available to people in federated networks that don’t have recommendation systems is the old-fashioned kind of recommendation system, which is saying to the people who follow you, “please tell your friends about this.” And that is an organic, social, authentic way of making these things work. It eliminates influencer as a job and replaces it with people who other people trust. And when those other people are trustworthy and they tell you that you might like something, like I post book reviews to my Fediverse feed, and lots of people read those books and they forward those book reviews around, they retoot them in order to get them to other places. And that’s a really exciting and powerful way to reach people, and it makes for a much deeper connection. And it’s one that’s more durable and less intermediatable by the people who want to step between you and the people who follow you and take your money. Bluesky technically looks pretty interesting, but it’s not federated. It is Federateable. And so this is like someone saying, “I have this service. It has all kinds of features that will stop me from abusing you, and I promise that I’ll turn them on later.” “Well, okay, but I prefer that you turn them on now. Or how about you tell me when you’ve turned them on and then I’ll come back and start using your service?” In the meantime, the board of directors of that one Bluesky service that exists, the one that is the only one you can join, the Federation of one, that board of directors includes the guy who sold Twitter to Elon Musk. And so if the idea is Bluesky is preferable to Twitter because you are not subject to the foolish decisions of individuals who run the service because you can always go elsewhere. Bluesky is a service that is actually owned or managed or overseen by the same fool who made the worst decision in Twitter’s history, and there’s nowhere else you can go if you don’t like it. KH : One of the problems that many of us have encountered when trying to lure people toward alternatives to Facebook and Twitter, so that we can keep our digital communities intact, is that we simply cannot get around the problem of switching costs. Sure, the alternatives themselves often have problems, but in my experience, few of those problems are worse than what’s presently happening at Twitter, where Elon Musk’s fascistic, sycophantic fan base is being algorithmically amplified at the expense of content that most of us actually want to see and engage with. So when we name the various frustrations that are keeping us from fully engaging with other platforms, it’s not that those problems aren’t real, but I think the bigger issue is that those problems are not offset by the presence of the communities we have come to rely on, many of whom are still holding on at Twitter, even as the site’s deterioration makes us all miserable. CD : This was one of the problems with the Web3 people is that in addition to being kind of grounded in this speculative, hypercapitalist cryptocurrency nonsense, they also thought that the reason that people kept using Facebook or Twitter is because they didn’t know about better alternatives. Not that they understood that there were better alternatives, but as good as those were, they weren’t better than being around the people that they cared about. And they thought, “Okay, if we just show them something better, they will walk away from the people they love and go to the better thing and wait for the people they love to show up.” And no one’s going to do that. It’s a bridge too far. And no one ever did do it. The way that our technology grew historically was by people making interoperable layers so that the switching costs were as low as possible, not by having this kind of holus bolus exodus. My grandmother’s story is kind of relevant here. So my grandmother was a Soviet refugee, a child soldier in the siege of Leningrad who was evacuated across the winter ice when she was two years in, when she was 15, and then got inducted into the Red Army and then got knocked up by my grandfather. And then after the war, they fled to Canada via a displaced person’s boat out of Frankfurt. And she was the only person in her family who left the Soviet Union, although all of them suffered under Soviet mismanagement and authoritarianism. And the reason for that is that in order to leave, she had to give up everything. She didn’t know if her family were alive or dead for 15 years. She didn’t know. She didn’t have anything she’d grown up with, not a photo, not anything but the clothes on her back. She gave it all up, and that cost was too high for her family members to give up, and they stayed. And it was and remains a problem. My family in St. Petersburg are in a really bad place because they or their ancestors didn’t follow my grandmother to Canada, but they didn’t because the switching costs were too high. It wasn’t because the situation wasn’t bad, it was because the switching costs were too high. If we want to make it easier, if we want people to go somewhere better, we have to make it easier for them to leave. KH : Given Cory’s expertise in computers, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to get his take on a couple of the big topics we have discussed this season: AI and long-termism. CD : Well, I think AI is wildly over-hyped. I think if you add up all the things that AI is good for… And it’s good at some things, I just saw my friend Patrick Ball from the Human Rights Data Analysis Group talk about how they use large language models during the Truth and Reconciliation hearings in Colombia to assemble the largest dataset, human rights dataset ever, and to assign probabilities that individual accounts of murders were carried out by either right-wing militias, the FARC, or the government, or were unrelated to the Civil War and how this has been very important and holding responsible parties to account in Colombia’s Truth and Reconciliation. That’s amazing, but the idea that we are going to have a multi-trillion dollar industry by automating some of the process of characterizing accounts of murder in a war zone, or that we are going to somehow make it all worthwhile by eliminating all the lowliest, most automated illustration jobs that are total wage bill is in the single digit millions of dollars, then you know that they’re just lying, right? On the one hand, it’s wildly immoral to want to destroy the livelihood of every commercial illustrator, but on the other hand, if you manage it, you won’t even accomplish the 10th of a percent of the savings that would justify the valuation that your company has gotten. And for most everything else, it’s basically nonsense. All the decision support applications where it’s like, “Oh, we’re going to use it to find cancer, but we’re going to have a human in the loop, a radiographer who reviews the x-rays and makes a call about the judgment that the machine has made.” Well, if that person is actually going to investigate the machine judgment in depth and make a real call about it, then it’s going to be just as slow as not using the machine. And so nobody is going to buy a machine to use it that way. The only point of having such a machine is to allow decisions to be made faster than any human could review them. And that’s really the intent. And so the only way that this can possibly be worth the valuation that’s been assigned to it is if it’s used in incredibly harmful ways. As to long-termism and TESCREAL and so on. Look, I’m a cyberpunk writer. It was meant as a warning, not a suggestion. The fact that these people can’t tell the difference means that they’re both very stupid and very frightening. KH : Well, I am so grateful for this conversation and for Cory’s book, which I think is a tremendous resource for people who want to reclaim the internet’s potential and leverage our connectivity to do great things. If you’re like me, you won’t agree with everything in The Internet Con , but I think we should welcome that, and that we should be open to engaging with our disagreements constructively, to see what we might learn. I definitely learned a lot from this book and I think every activist and organizer should give it a read. Given that I think everyone who listens to this show wants to make the world a better place, I also appreciated Cory’s parting message for our listeners. CD : So I would urge us all to be Luddites in the best sense of the word. So you know that Luddite is a term that is used as a synonym for a technophobe, but the Luddites weren’t technophobes. To be a textile worker in the dawn of the industrial revolution, you needed to complete a seven-year apprenticeship using the most technically advanced machines of the day. A textile worker was like someone with a master’s degree in engineering from MIT. And what they were angry about was not the machines. They were angry about the social arrangements of the machines. It wasn’t what the machines did, it was who they did it for and who it did it to. They were angry because their bosses had these machines that they said were so easy children could use them, and they were kidnapping children from the Napoleonic War orphanages in London and forcing them to work in the mills, in periods of 10 years of indenture during which they would be beaten and starved, maimed and often killed. Robert Blincoe survived the mills, wrote a memoir that became a bestseller and inspired Charles Dickens to write Oliver Twist , which is really best understood as Luddite fanfic. The Luddites wanted the machinery to be accountable to the workforce and the people they served, and not to the forces of capital. Computers are incredibly powerful tools for activists. I cut my teeth riding a bicycle all night around the streets of Toronto, wheat-pasting posters to telephone poles to get people to turn out for demonstrations. And if you’ve never tried to organize a movement without the internet, I’m here to tell you, it’s really hard. We need to seize the means of computation, because while the internet isn’t the most important thing that we have to worry about right now, all the things that are more important, gender and racial justice, inequality, the climate emergency, those are struggles that we’re going to win or lose by organizing on the internet. And the internet has these foundational characteristics, the interoperability, the universality, working encryption that lets us keep secrets, that allow us to organize mass movements in ways that our forebears could only have dreamt of. And it’s up to us to take control of that technology and make it work for us. KH : I appreciate Cory’s argument that while there are struggles of greater moral importance than what happens to the internet, we cannot win those struggles without taking on Big Tech. I wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment, which is why we will keep circling back to tech issues on this season of the show. I hope these discussions leave us all better informed and better prepared to seize the means of computation, and to wage our struggles for liberation. I want to thank Cory Doctorow for joining us today. I learned a lot from talking to Cory and from reading his book, and I am looking forward to checking out some of his sci-fi titles as well. I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I’ll see you in the streets. Show Notes
Critics questioned whether Musk’s actions had violated the Logan Act. Senate Democrats on the Armed Forces Committee are calling for an inquiry into billionaire Elon Musk’s actions regarding his restrictions on the Ukraine military’s use of his Starlink internet satellite system. Excerpts from a soon-to-be-published book about Musk revealed that he disallowed access to the network during a drone mission near Crimea last year. Initial media reports about the book claim that Musk made the decision after having conversations with senior Russian officials. The recent revelation has elicited praise from Russian President Vladimir Putin . A statement from Musk defending his action differs from the account laid out in the book. Whereas Musk recently claimed he “refused to act upon a request from Ukraine” to extend the use of Starlink to the region (ostensibly believing that extending use of Starlink to the region would escalate the conflict ), the book suggests Musk actively disabled access to the network prior to the mission. “The differing versions of events further highlights the confusion surrounding the circumstances of this reported incident. The confusion over what actually happened during this Ukrainian attack — and Mr. Musk’s specific role — demands answers,” a letter to the Department of Defense (DOD) from Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), Jeanne Shaheen (D-New Hampshire) and Tammy Duckworth (D-Illinois) said. Excerpts from the book suggest that Musk provided “de facto protection” to Russia, and “raise serious concerns about whether Mr. Musk has personally intervened to undermine a key U.S. partner at a critical juncture,” the letter went on . Warren specifically demanded a review of military contracts that Musk recently obtained from the DOD. “We need to investigate how this happened,” Warren said this week . “What’s in those contracts that permits him to have this kind of power?” It is the “responsibility of the Department of Defense to go back and take a look at those contracts,” Warren added. “That kind of activity poses a danger to the United States, to Ukraine and to the rest of the world.” Senate Armed Services Committee chair Sen. Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island) announced on Thursday that, although a formal investigation has not yet begun, “the committee is aggressively probing this issue from every angle.” Critics on social media have alleged that Musk’s actions against Ukraine may have run afoul of the Logan Act, a federal law that forbids private citizens from interfering in the foreign affairs of the United States government. The text of that act reads as follows : Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. “The Logan Act makes it a federal crime for private citizens to conduct foreign policy on their own — not to mention making military decisions that contradict U.S. strategic goals. Elon Musk is doing both,” said political commentator Howard Fineman .
Musk and Bezos are peddling new age-y religious drama of disaster and salvation, says author Mary-Jane Rubenstein. “What we’re getting from both Musk and Bezos is this classically new age-y religious drama of disaster and salvation. They preach, they tell us that the end is near, the disaster is coming, that the world is going to end, but there is another world that everybody can build together, a new world and a place that they’ve never seen and a place that seems totally impossible,” says professor Mary-Jane Rubenstein, author of Astrotopia: The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race . In this episode of “Movement Memos,” host Kelly Hayes and Rubenstein discuss the religiosity of “NewSpace,” and how activists can challenge the new “pie in the sky” ideology that billionaires like Musk and Bezos are crafting. Music by Son Monarcas & David Celeste Note: This a rush transcript and has been lightly edited for clarity. Copy may not be in its final form. Kelly Hayes : Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity and the work of making change. I’m your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today, we are talking about the new space race and the peculiar religiosity that drives it. Billionaires like Elon Musk have promoted fantasies that humanity’s best hope, in the face of an apocalyptic crisis, lies in the colonization of space. Jeff Bezos has argued that the extractive industrialization of space will ultimately make life on Earth sustainable. It would be easy to dismiss these ideas as the folly of billionaires who are playing with rockets like children with Legos, while spinning fantasies that portray them as heroes and saviors, rather than the catastrophic figures that they truly are. While I believe those characterizations are accurate, it is important for us to understand the narratives these men are shaping, and what gives those stories power in the world. Because we are living in unstable times, and as we have seen in recent years, people whose lives and worldviews have been destabilized can often be deceived, or even consumed, by elaborate falsehoods. The myth-making of the tech industry may strike many of us as absurd, but it has given the billionaire class a new pie in the sky to market to the masses. In the new space race, some of capitalism’s major players are exploiting our fascination with the stars, and our imperiled hopes for the future, in order to build a new religiosity from some very old, familiar parts. Today, we are talking to Mary-Jane Rubenstein. MJ is a professor of Religion and Science in Society at Wesleyan University. She is the author, most recently, of Astrotopia: The Dangerous Religion of the Corporate Space Race . If you want to understand how men like Musk and Bezos are exploiting sci-fi tropes and religiosity to advance their own agenda with regard to space, Astrotopia is an invaluable resource. The book also offers some insightful analysis of science fiction stories that run counter to the techno-mythos of the late capitalist billionaire class, and other ideas that can help us chip away at the narratives of space-obsessed billionaires. This discussion of the new space race is part of an arc of episodes examining tech issues and how they relate to the work of making change. I wanted to create this episode block because I think our movements need a stronger analysis of what’s happening in Silicon Valley, and how emerging technologies, and the mythologies around them, are shaping popular worldviews. Late capitalism is an era of catastrophe, and catastrophe makes people vulnerable to cult-ish thinking and religiosity, among other things. If we are going to win narrative battles with billionaires and the cults of Silicon Valley, we need to understand those stories, why they are getting traction, and what their vulnerabilities are. I’m able to put together episodes like this one thanks to Truthout , which is a nonprofit news organization with no ads, no paywalls and no corporate sponsors. We are a reader- and listener-powered organization that does not hide behind the pretense of objectivity, because we understand that the world needs to change. We’re also a union shop with the best family and sick leave policies in the industry. So if you would like to support our work, you can sign up for our newsletter or make a donation at truthout.org. You can also support the show by subscribing to Movement Memos on Apple or Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts, by leaving a positive review on those platforms, or by sharing your favorite episodes. Keeping a media organization afloat in these times is not easy, but with your support, we’re still in this thing, so thank you for believing in us and what we do. And with that, I hope you enjoy the show. Mary Jane Rubenstein : My name is Mary Jane Rubenstein. I use she/her pronouns. And I am trained up in a discipline called philosophy of religion, which tends to look at the way that religion works in the world, the way that it shapes people’s lives and hopes and expectations. The way it motivates people to act in the universe or not to act in the universe. I’ve increasingly been working on the ways that religion shows up in places that we don’t tend to expect to see it, the way that it shows up in politics, for example, or economics. One of the places that I’ve been increasingly looking for resonances and echoes of our religious traditions is in the natural sciences, which might seem to be a funny and unexpected place to go. But it turns out that even the natural sciences are shaped by stories that religions tell, assumptions that they make, teachings that they give us about who counts in the world, who’s important. So that is what I’ve been looking at recently. Most recently I’m looking at the way that religion’s been showing up in the contemporary space race and contemporary efforts to increase human presence in space, eventually to colonize other planets and other places in our solar system. KH : One question I’ve heard a lot when talking to people about the new space race is, How the hell did we get here? When I was growing up, in the 1980s, space exploration was widely viewed as a noble undertaking — one that the U.S. claimed to pursue “for all mankind.” While not everyone bought into the lofty rhetoric of NASA in the last century, as Gil Scott-Heron memorably illustrated with his poem, “ Whitey on the Moon ,” something has definitely changed since then. So, how did space become the pet project of billionaires? MJR : It’s a bit of a mess. So NewSpace is like a neologism, I don’t know, it’s one of those words that gets smushed together in camel case, the N is big and the S is big and they smush them together. NewSpace refers to the era in which private corporations are primarily driving our interests and our actions in outer space. Corporate presence, corporate interest, corporate capacity has shaped our presence in space since the very beginning. The nation-states have always been contracting with Boeing and Lockheed Martin to make those rockets, to get NASA out of our atmosphere. But increasingly, corporations have been setting the goals, the priorities, the standards for what we do in outer space. The way this came to pass, I see recent history as having been marked by two major initiatives in the U.S. context. The first is in 2011 when Barack Obama canceled funding for NASA’s space shuttle program and redirected those funds instead to the private sector. He had been advised by the major council to start turning over space interests, space traffic, space transportation to the private sector. The way that the railways have been increasingly privatized and bus transportation has been increasingly privatized and certainly cars are privatized. So that was the first big advancement toward this new space era. The second came in 2015, when in response to some investors’ concerns, the U.S. pushed this staggeringly bilateral piece of legislation called the Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act, or CSLC… It’s just a terrible acronym. The Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act guarantees investors that any resource, and I’m using this term in quotation marks, any “resource” recovered from outer space, can in fact be owned, bought, sold, and transported and transferred under U.S. law. There had been some concern that United Nations legislation, a treaty that has been signed by over a hundred parties in the UN, would prevent anything like private ownership of space resources. So the U.S. just passed a law, its own law saying, “No, no, it’s okay. You can own the stuff that you recover in space.” And really from that point on, from 2015 on, there’s been an explosion of investment in space, of prospective space mining corporations, of private rocket companies, of space tourism companies, because now investors are ensured that they can make a profit in outer space. KH : The privatization of space has ushered in the hyper-masculine competition between billionaires that presently defines NewSpace. Despite Obama’s stated intention of saving taxpayer dollars, early investments from government agencies have been crucial to major commercial space projects. Commercial space companies received $7.2 billion in investments from the U.S. government between 2000 and 2018. During its first year, SpaceX had an operating budget of about $1 billion. About half of that money came from contracts with NASA. In 2022, SpaceX brought in $2.8 billion in funding from government contracts. In April of 2022, Bernie Sanders wrote in the Guardian , “I am concerned that Nasa has become little more than an ATM machine to fuel a space race not between the US and other countries, but between the two wealthiest men in America — Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, who are worth more than $450bn combined.” MJR : So Musk and Bezos are probably the two best known actors in the contemporary corporate space race. As you probably know, Elon Musk wants us to move to Mars. He wants to colonize Mars. Jeff Bezos has a different plan. He thinks Mars is too far away. He wants to build space colonies that are closer to home that are positioned between the moon and the Earth. It would be sort of like living in a mall, a space mall, like a rotating indoor shopping center where the climate is controlled and there’s no real outside. But presumably you’d be able to grow some plants and things like that, and you’d be able to get your food and it would be totally perfect weather all year round and things like that. So anyway, they have different views about what our lives are going to look like in outer space. Again, Musk has this sort of homesteader ideal that we’re going to terraform Mars and make it habitable for human beings. Bezos wants to keep us a little closer to Earth in these rotating shopping malls. Both of them are convinced that in order for human beings to, well, survive for Elon Musk, or to thrive for Jeff Bezos, we have to leave the Earth. And each of them is using his massive economic status and power to channel ungodly amounts of money and resources into conquering the cosmos so that human beings can have a decent future. KH : Elon Musk famously responded to Bernie Sanders’s critiques of his astronomical wealth by stating that, “I am accumulating resources to help make life multiplanetary and extend the light of consciousness to the stars.” In keeping with other longtermist ideas , this statement suggests that unthinkable levels of inequality are necessary, for the sake of humanity’s deep future, but it also implies that astronomical personal wealth is what makes space exploration possible. In reality, we know that public contracts, and public money, are essential to NewSpace, which is why Bezos’s company Blue Origin and Musk’s SpaceX spent $2 million and $2.4 million, respectively , lobbying for government contracts in 2021. But Musk’s talk of using his vast wealth to “extend the light of consciousness” also helps spin popular mythos around extreme inequality in our times — like a new variation of the Divine Right of Kings. Instead of being chosen by God, men like Musk and Bezos are chosen by the market, and rather than representing an injustice, their absurd wealth supposedly represents our best hope for the future. I know a lot of you may not be religious or big fans of modern myths, but it’s crucial that we understand the role that such ideas play and will continue to play in an era of mass crisis. MJR : So I said that at the beginning that I am a person who’s on the lookout for places that religion shows up where it might not be expected. When it comes to the contemporary space race, I think religion is showing up in two major places. The first is that there is a specifically Christian heritage to the European idea that it is somehow the destiny of particular human beings to take new land, exploit its resources and remake that land in the image of the people who got it. There have been, again, particularly Christian justifications for this kind of seizure of land since the 15th century, when the Pope at the time gave Africa to Portugal and the so-called New World to Spain and said, “God wants Spain and Portugal to take these lands to exploit its resources for the glory of Spain and Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula and of course for the salvation of souls.” So the idea that religion was providing there was this ideal of saving people through conversion that would also have these ancillary economic benefits. Of course, what the nations were really after were the economic benefits. Religion provided this justification that it is God’s will that we do these things. That notion that God wants particular people to take land, to remake it and to get rich from it was reanimated during the period of American manifest destiny when mainly white-skinned descendants of the European settlers moved their way across the continent under the idea that God wanted these European descendants to take over the entire continent of North America. And it was reanimated again in the 1950s when the agents of the original space race started claiming that it was America’s manifest destiny now to conquer outer space. So in one sense, Musk and Bezos and the national space agencies at this point, particularly the U.S. national space agency (NASA), are reanimating this old religious drama of conquering new land in the name of some magnificent human destiny. There’s also this other… This is the second place that religion is coming into play. There’s this different way that a more new age-y approach to religion is operating. This relies less on those old Christian doctrines of the Earth belonging to us and things like that, and relies more on the private charisms of very energetic men. So there’s a messianic component to the new space race where these guys set themselves up as the saviors of the universe and develop cadres of people who believe in them as the way to a kind of salvation. In that sense, what we’re getting from both Musk and Bezos is this classically new age-y religious drama of disaster and salvation. They preach, they tell us that the end is near, the disaster is coming, that the world is going to end, but there is another world that everybody can build together, a new world and a place that they’ve never seen and a place that seems totally impossible. But just have faith and you will gain salvation from this coming disaster in this new world in some other place that again, nobody’s ever seen. So those are the two big things. We’ve got this sort of long legacy of Christian imperialism on the one hand and then these private cults of personality around Musk and Bezos on the other hand. KH : Given the catastrophic damage that Christian imperialism and other conquest-driven ideologies have caused here on Earth, it is unsurprising that the environmental costs of extending these concepts to space are, in fact, astronomical. MJR : The environmental damage that the contemporary space race is doing is one of the most under-discussed crises of our contemporary moment. We are just trying to get a hold on the kind of damage that factory farming does to our atmosphere and the kind of damage that plastics that we are dumping into our ocean and that private vehicles emit into our skies. Just as we’re trying to figure out if there’s any way to cap that kind of carbon, we have this intensification of rockets dumping fuel into outer space. I think there are three major areas in which this intensified space activity is doing a lot of damage. The first, which may be the least visible, the first area in which the space race is doing a ton of damage is in the staggeringly high number of new satellites in orbit. As you may know, every two weeks, Elon Musk’s company Starlink sends 60 new satellites into orbit. Just for reference, before 1957, the Earth had one satellite. That was the moon. That was it. 1957, Russian satellite, Sputnik heads up with a little partner to help it out. Now we’ve got two more. There are two artificial satellites and then a moon. Then as the old-fashioned space race intensifies, there are more satellites for military observation. As the telecommunications revolution gets going, we have more satellites for telecommunications, for weather mapping. Now, Elon Musk is trying to build what he calls a constellation of satellites to provide flawless internet connections, very high speed downloads no matter where you are on Earth. And the means of doing this is to launch tens of thousands of satellites into orbit. So the problem is that once stuff goes up into low Earth orbit, it doesn’t come down unless it does. Every once in a while, something will just fall out of orbit and burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere, which itself has some environmental effect, but when it doesn’t, it just stays up there forever. A defunct satellite just stays up there, hurdling at, again, tens of thousands of miles per hour and doing immense damage if it collides with anything else. Any collision of anything else in space produces tens of thousands of shards of stuff from nuts and bolts to paint chips to cell phones. There’s just so much rubbish at this point in low Earth orbit that A: it’s becoming increasingly dangerous for anybody to do anything in space. So every so often, the International Space Station has to go into lockdown because there seems to be something coming at it at tens of thousands of miles per hour. And B: with all this stuff in low Earth orbit, this stuff is now reflecting light such that many Earthlings, most Earthlings can’t see stars anymore anywhere. So astronomers are freaking out because they can’t get decent photographs of the stars, they can’t see the stars, they can’t teach their students about stars. Indigenous communities are up in arms saying, “We require access to the stars visually in order to navigate, in order to know the seasons, in order to conduct our festivals.” So the pollution in low Earth orbit alone is worth getting absolutely nuts about if you care at all about ecology. But then there’s the issue of just sending rockets into outer space. A recent article was just published saying we’re looking at about a 5.6 percent increase in rocket traffic every year since the mid 2010s. The problem with rockets is that from the moment… I mean, there’s the construction, there’s the mining that goes into the construction. You can just think about this as an ecological disaster at every moment of it. If you’re Elon Musk and you’re building a 400-foot tall rocket, how much does that require you to mine? Where do you have to open new mines to get more materials for your rocket? So there’s that. Then the rocket sits on the launchpad, the rocket launches from the launchpad and the rocket destroys the launchpad. So now you’ve got tons of concrete just being scattered to the wind. The launch of the first Starship in April ended up destroying its launchpad and sending slabs of concrete as far as six and a half miles away in Boca Chica, Texas, and just littering the entire landscape with particulate matter that was basically shredded concrete everywhere. The wetlands were blanketed in this stuff, people’s homes were blanketed in this stuff, the air was blanketed in this stuff. That’s just the launch. Then Starship gets four minutes into its launch, it’s dumping all of its… Its fuel is kerosene, so it’s dumping kerosene into our air, and then four minutes in, it turns out the booster doesn’t separate. So they decide just to detonate the whole thing. Now rocket parts are falling into the sea and rocket parts are falling into, again, people’s yards, backyards and into those wetlands and little bits of plastic and little bits of steel… Just absolutely everywhere. So again, from my perspective, this is a complete environmental disaster. Then, even if the rocket is successful, all of that fuel, whether it’s kerosene, whether it’s hydrogen, whatever the fuel is, starts depositing things like carbon dioxide; water, which at these heights can be polluting; chlorine, methane — not just into the atmosphere, but into the upper atmosphere where we’ve never really deposited a bunch of toxins before. So all we know is that in the upper atmosphere, they stay around a lot longer and can have an intensified global warming effect, greenhouse effect on our lower atmosphere. So those are the problems, and as you can hear from my intensely anxious tone here, I think we’ve got an ecological disaster going on when it comes to intensified space activity. KH : As we talked about in our episode on longtermism , Elon Musk has supported the idea that every second wasted in the race to colonize space costs trillions of future human and digital human lives in the deep future. Does he really believe that? As I’ve mentioned before, I don’t think it really matters what people believe when they partake in the weaponization of ideas, but I also wouldn’t underestimate an egotist’s ability to get high on his own supply. After all, Musk operates in the tech world, where lies and hubris are often viewed as precursors to innovation. In Silicon Valley, making up stories about what your company will accomplish, as a means to acquire investment, without knowing how to actually accomplish your stated goal, is a standard practice — as Wendy Liu and Corey Pein demonstrate in their respective books, Abolish Silicon Valley: How to Liberate Technology from Capitalism , and Live Work Work Work Die . In the tech world, hype and hubris come first, and actual blueprints for success may or may not come later, assuming a startup manages to secure the interest of venture capitalists. So, in a sense, Silicon Valley runs on cut-rate science fiction prompts, generated by people who often have no idea how to make their ideas materialize. When we consider Musk’s narrative style in this context, we can understand why he would claim that SpaceX would soon take carbon out of the air, and use it as rocket fuel, or that Tesla’s self-driving cars would be making cross-country trips without intervention by the end of 2017, or that SpaceX would probably build a base on Mars by 2028, because in his mind, this how innovation works. You just make up a story and solicit investment. If, on occasion, you succeed, people will call you a genius, and when you fail, there are few, if any, consequences. In 2018, Elon Musk tweeted that, “About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth & half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens & we destroy ourselves.” But in a 2014 interview, Musk made his disregard for what ultimately happens on this planet quite plain when he stated , “Fuck Earth! Who cares about Earth?” Musk argued that, “If we can establish a Mars colony, we can almost certainly colonize the whole solar system, because we’ll have created a strong economic forcing function for the improvement of space travel.” As we’ve previously discussed, Musk subscribes to longtermist ideas about the preservation of human consciousness through AI and space colonization — ideas that conveniently justify the extremity of his wealth and the continuance of any suffering, here and now, that his wealth might alleviate, if it were redistributed. MJR : The way that Musk’s line goes is: Look, Earth is done. Earth is over. It’s used up. Also, it’s basically a ticking time bomb that eventually something is going to come and wipe out the only species that matters to him on Earth, which is to say humanity. Something’s going to come for humanity soon. This will either be nuclear war or it will be AI gone rogue to destroy us, or it will be an asteroid that hits us and wipes us out the way that it did the dinosaurs. Elon Musk doesn’t tend to talk much about global warming. Jeff Bezos does, but Musk doesn’t. So anyway, some disaster is going to come wipe out humanity. So either we go the way of the dinosaurs and we go extinct. Or we’ve got to get the hell off this planet and find a way to colonize a backup planet so that we’ve got basically a backup drive for humanity, where all of the genius of human production can be preserved. Where are we going to go? Venus is too hot. It’s 900 degrees Fahrenheit. That is a complete non-starter. We’re not going to live on Venus. The moon, I think he just thinks the moon kind of sucks. It’s too close by. His mentor, Bob Zubrin, will say of the moon: the cops are too close. It only takes three days to get there. Earthly regulation’s just going to get you. Mars on the other hand, now there’s a planet. It’s not boiling like Venus. It’s nice and far away. It’s like three to four months on a good day to get to Mars, six months to get to Mars on a bad day. It just takes a while. “Sure,” says Musk, “It’s a bit cold,” he says. “But we can warm it up.” How do we warm it up? Well, there have been all sorts of proposals for generations about bringing prebiotic goo that might seed itself over tens of thousands of years, slowly into some kind of soup that might eventually become amoebas that might eventually become complex life at some point. This takes far too long for Elon Musk. He says the planet will warm up a lot faster if we just nuke it. Nuke the polar ice caps of Mars, create a greenhouse effect akin to the one that is currently roasting the Earth and you warm up a frozen planet. Is it radioactive there? Sure. He doesn’t really care too much. He says the radiation thing isn’t really too big of a deal and we’ll just live underground in bunkers for a while until the planet becomes a little more hospitable by means of our nuclear weapons. Yes, it is an absolutely absurd plan. That having been said, it doesn’t really matter that it’s absurd because of the hearts and minds Musk has won in the process. Will he eventually get a mission to Mars? Yeah, I absolutely think so. Will he eventually get a million people to Mars to start homesteading it? Probably not, but that’s the vision that he needs in order to sell the whole prospect of heading to Mars in the first place. And in the meantime, he’s got the Starlink satellites, and in the meantime, he’s got the NASA contracts. What I’m trying to say is I don’t think Elon Musk, a private entrepreneur, would have gotten NASA to offload to him so many of its contracts — I don’t think that he would’ve had the wherewithal to set up this massive Starlink Constellation without a big vision that presents itself as humanitarian, as future-oriented, as ideologically pristine, which is to say it’s a vision of the salvation of humanity that’s going to take place on Mars. And again, once you sort of shake off the ideological patina here, you realize that Mars is terrible. It’s a terrible planet. If you get an invitation to go homestead Mars, probably don’t do it. It’s bad there. It’s really bad there. But I think he needs that vision in order to sell any of it. KH : So, in Elon Musk, we have a man whose preposterous ideas are propped up by extreme wealth, a cult of personality, and one of the most absurd privatization gambits in U.S. history. But his current endeavors, like those of Jeff Bezos and other men who would like to rule space, are also propped up by some of the same ideas that have allowed the wealthy to loot and pillage the world we currently inhabit. As MJ writes in Astrotopia : Given its equation of knowledge of nature with power over nature, Western techno-science needs to view the natural world as composed of objects rather than subjects. After all, if the mountaintops were ancestors, then we couldn’t remove them. If the stones were persons, we couldn’t frack them. If the forests had spirits, we’d hesitate to clear-cut them. MJR : So the point I’m trying to make about Western technoscience, seeing the world as objects rather than subjects is totally indebted to the mid-century historian named Lynn White who writes this essay that at this point everybody has read and critiqued and said that it works or it doesn’t work, but the infrastructure stands. His argument there is that capitalism and Western technoscience could not have gotten off the ground without the Christian conquest of what Christianity calls paganism. Now he’s speaking in very broad gestures here, but what he means is that for the Indigenous traditions that Christianity calls pagan, the world, the landscape is inhabited by a whole host of more than human actors, agents, subjects. So non-human animals are subjects in their own right. They’re agents, they have their own wills and desires and communities and things like that. Rivers are said to be persons, rocks even, trees are said to be persons. Forests have either spirits or they themselves are communities of people. And in order to interact with a forest in this kind of animate landscape, if a forest is alive, in order to interact with that forest, you have to talk to it. You have to bargain with it, and you have to negotiate with it. If you want to cut down a tree, for example, you have to ask a forest’s permission. You have to ask the tree’s permission, you have to find ways to make amends, to plant a tree elsewhere or something like that. So if the world is composed of subjects, then human needs don’t automatically supersede everybody else’s needs. Humanity has to interact with other persons in the world to figure out how to keep the balance in those ecosystems. One of the problems of a particularly bad reading of Jewish and Christian theology, one effect of this is to see the natural world as just composed of objects rather than subjects. So Genesis will tell us that humans are made in the image of God, but that nothing else is made in the image of God. And in fact, that humans have dominion over the rest of the world, that humans have control over the rest of the world. Taken on its own, there are all sorts of ways to read this passage, but when these passages team up with imperial politics, the understanding of Genesis becomes: human beings are basically gods on Earth. Human beings are in charge of everybody else, and human beings are the only one that counts. So as Christianity takes over the Indigenous, animist, pagan ways of relating to the landscape over, certainly the early modern period, what happens is that increasingly the world is seen as made up of objects, of things to use and exploit rather than subjects, which is to say, beings with whom we have to engage. It’s that kind of mindset that capitalism needs to exploit as many resources as possible, not just what we need, but anything we can get. It’s that mindset that imperialism and frontierism need to say, “This land belongs to us and we can shape it in any way that we want.” It’s this mindset of course, that’s allowing us to think about asteroids as resources and the moon as containing resources and the moon as a possible gas station in the sky and Mars as something that could be nuked for human comfort. KH : We’re talking a lot about conquest and visions for commerce in space, and as we know, historically, conquest and militarism traditionally go hand in hand. When Donald Trump announced the creation of the United States Space Force in 2019, critics responded with memes and mockery. Netflix even rolled out a satirical comedy entitled “Space Force,” starring Steve Carrell, the following year. But in a discussion of how Christian imperialist ideas are influencing the new space race, we would be remiss if we did not discuss the disturbing implications of militarizing space. MJR : The implications of militarizing space are bad. My reading of the only significant piece of international legislation that we’ve got, which is to say the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. There’s a much longer name, but it’s usually referred to as the OST, the Outer Space Treaty. My reading of this treaty is that it was trying to say, listen, as human communities are headed up into space, we risk doing the kinds of things in outer space that we have done on Earth, which is to say colonization, which is to say rivalry over land, increasing militarization, competition over resources, et cetera. The last two world wars (we might say in 1967) have absolutely decimated the planet. Did they care about the planet? Probably not so much, but have absolutely decimated the people of the Earth and even just the people of the overdeveloped nations, the so-called First World, even if they’re just concerned about that. Europe basically destroyed itself over the course of these two world wars. My reading of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty is that the authors were saying, “Let’s not do that again. Let’s not do this again. Let’s not do this kind of game of Risk again in outer space where things are much more dangerous now that we’ve learned from what we can do to ourselves on Earth.” So there are some stipulations of the Outer Space Treaty that say things like, “No nation can own a piece of land in outer space.” You just can’t. It’s the heritage of all humankind. So nations can’t own it. We can’t position any nuclear weapons in outer space, et cetera. Again, my understanding of the spirit of this law is to say you can’t own stuff and you can’t go to war in outer space, period. But of course, in the intervening decades, nations led by the U.S. have increasingly found ways to find loopholes, things that they didn’t really say and have found ways to say, actually, we can own some stuff in outer space. Yeah, we can’t station weapons in outer space or station nuclear weapons, but maybe we could fly nuclear weapons without stationing them. Or maybe that doesn’t apply to regular weapons. Or if weapons are intended for peaceful purposes, then weapons are okay because the Outer Space Treaty says we’re supposed to use space for peace … so peaceful weapons are okay, but not nuclear weapons. It seems to me that the creation of the Space Force, the military theorists will tell you this is nothing new. This is just the Air Force. This is what the Air Force has been doing for decades, just to say they’ve been monitoring activity in outer space. They’ve been developing anti-satellite technology and either using it or not using it. Right now, we’re not supposed to be using it. They’ve been tracking possible anti-satellite behavior on the part of other nations. The Space Force was just a big media circus, but it’s really just supposed to have been what the Air Force was doing all along. I think symbolically and politically and rhetorically, the creation of the Space Force says that we do not agree that space is supposed to be a theater of peace. Rather, it’s supposed to be a theater of war. The way that the U.S. has justified the creation of the Space Force is by saying that Russia and China have already developed these capacities, therefore we need to develop them in order to fend them off. Therefore, the creation of the Space Force is actually in the interests of peace because any defensive strategies are actually peacekeeping strategies rather than aggressive strategies. From the perspective of Russia and China, they think that this is an immense escalation of military presence in outer space and feel like this is actually an unprecedented move. So now they’re going to have to do the same and they’re going to have to start increasing the militarization of outer space. This too is a complete mess. KH : Now, we have covered some pretty depressing ground here, from space travel as the new pie in the sky, justifying our continued oppression, to imperialism in space. We have talked about how our fascination with space and our love of science fiction are being leveraged by wealth-hoarding billionaires with agendas that are as wicked as they are absurd. But as I mentioned at the top of the show, I am actually a pretty huge fan of science fiction. I do not believe that our love of possibility or our fascination with the heavens are the problem. What we’re looking at is the exploitation of our awe, wonder and other worldly aspirations by the kind of people who will exploit anything in order to further consolidate wealth and amplify their own importance. That kind of co-optation can be fought in a number of ways, but one thing I really appreciate about Astrotopia is MJ’s exploration of science fiction stories that do not fit the imperialist framing of space exploration that Musk and Bezos have laid out. MJR : So the bad news is that the way that the U.S. and increasingly other nations (and certainly the capitalist sector) are approaching outer space is motivated by really bad stories. They’re motivated by bad stories about human beings conquering land. About certain human beings mattering more than other human beings. About the rest of the biosphere not mattering at all. About destiny, about living room, breathing room for people who just want more space. About some kind of inherent desire for humans to want more stuff and take up more room. These are really bad stories. Again, it’s my sense that a lot of these stories come from a really icky reading of the Christian heritage. The good news is there are other stories out there. There are a lot of other stories out there, and that actually most of the peoples of the world have stories that are motivated by ethics of reciprocity with other living beings and care for the land and care for the Earth, and of stewardship and giving back. There are three places that I like to go to look for these stories. One of those places is in the stories that the either displaced or still emplaced Indigenous communities of the world can tell about how it is that we remain in relation to land. If land is understood as peopled, as occupied by beings, and a number of those communities – I’m thinking in particular of the Innuit of Bawaka Country, and in the Outback of Australia – will also talk about not just stewardship of Earth, but stewardship of space and the space ways too, that there’s a whole ecology that interrelates Earth and its neighbors in the cosmos. So there are better stories there. There are better stories in the works of speculative fiction authors and science fiction authors who can think about ways to even try to live on really inhospitable planets that don’t depend on destroying those planets in order to live there. There’s some great work here by Becky Chambers, by Annalee Newitz, by N.K. Jemisin. Certainly, I know a lot of people have drawn heavily on the work of Octavia Butler to think about new ways to live among the stars that not only don’t replicate colonial strategies, but that in fact speak to people who have been their targets and who have been oppressed by these kinds of strategies. So utopias for people who have traditionally been oppressed on Earth. So there’s that kind of fiction that gives us these new stories. Then finally, I think there are counter-traditional ways to read these biblical narratives themselves. If you were to ask Pope Francis whether human beings have the right to destroy the planet and go conquer others, he’d be like, “You have to get your head examined. This is a terrible way to read Genesis. You haven’t learned anything.” It is no longer accepted as a decent reading of scripture that human beings are given the power to do whatever they like to the Earth, or that human beings are the only sentient beings on the planet, or that the planet is somehow here for us to exploit. Neither the head of the Roman Catholic Church nor the head of the Anglican communion, nor the head of the Eastern Orthodox churches — none of them would say that this is a decent reading of these texts. So there are contemporary ways of reading an ecologically sensitive and even robust way of understanding these texts. So those are basically the ways that I look, the places that I look for different kinds of stories. Again, the stories of Indigenous folks, particularly the stories of Black and Indigenous and queer and feminist speculative fiction authors, and the work of these ecologically adoring, even Christian and Jewish and Muslim philosophers themselves. The question is: How do we get those stories as entrenched in the world of outer space as the old one is? That’s the challenge. That’s the difficulty, to say there are other ways to live. People know how to do it. In fact, a lot of people know how to do it. How do we turn those stories into policy and how do we turn those stories into practice? It’s always the activist struggle. KH : The question of how we turn our own stories into policy and practice is one we will have to keep returning to. As we discussed in our episode about longtermism, people like Musk, as absurd as his ideas might be, have made great strides with regard to social, economic and institutional power. So that’s one thing I would really like people to take away from this conversation — it’s not enough to dismiss the ideas of people like Musk as being outlandish or absurd. Of course they’re absurd. Musk’s claim that he is going to create a self-sustaining colony on Mars is utter nonsense, but it is not enough to simply know or assert that. The world we inhabit has been carved up and ravaged by people who leveraged ideas that were, in my opinion, no less absurd. Stories have power. The hopes that we offer people, in bleak times, have power. We have to understand the appeal of space as humanity’s last recourse, in these times of catastrophe and crisis, and we have to build movement narratives in opposition to that storytelling. Toward that end, MJ had some parting advice for our listeners. MJR : So the first thing that I’d like to caution is that we be suspicious of appeals to all of humanity. When we hear one of these new age-based prophets telling us that the salvation of the human species depends on conquering the cosmos in this way, we need to think along with Sylvia Wynter about what the category of humanity means, whom they actually want to save and what they actually want to save it for. At stake is not the salvation of humanity. At stake is the salvation of a particular way of living and a particular way of making a ton of money for very rich people, given that we live on a finite planet whose resources we’re exhausting. Capitalism relies on infinite growth. We can’t have infinite growth. We’re on a finite planet. So what we’re seeing right now convulsions of late stage capitalism; it’s realizing it’s reaching limits and is therefore seeking out other planets and using this humanitarian claim as a justification for primarily economic ends. So we need to know that. This is just as much of an ideological ploy as the idea that Spain needed to conquer the Americas in order to save Indian souls or something like that. So I’m recommending some suspicion when it comes to these big grand narratives about the salvation of all of humanity. What we can do about it is to join… There actually are conversations that even NASA is holding about its policies and its priorities. There have increasingly been astronomers and activists and anti-colonial academics and just space geeks who have started communicating to NASA that they love space, but they don’t want to see space done this particular way. I think that the more people whose voices are heard in this regard, the more likely it is that somebody might eventually be listening. But it’s not screaming into the void. They’re an increasing number of people who are trying to make themselves heard in this regard. So if you’re a space geek, you can find ways to love space, to love the idea of learning from space, to love the idea even of maybe getting to go there at some point, but while finding different ways to love it and learn from it than to ravage it. KH : I am so grateful for this conversation, and for MJ, and her wonderful book, Astrotopia . I think the lessons this book offers about history, Christian imperialism, and the danger of treating the natural world as objects, rather than subjects, are crucial in these times. I also appreciated the book as a lifelong fan of science fiction, who happens to believe that storytelling is a fight for the future. Because while my hopes for humanity are grounded here, on Earth, I, like many of you, was raised on stories about space exploration. As I have often told friends, watching Star Trek: Deep Space Nine as a child did more to open my mind about imperialism, and the oppression of Palestine, than any other influence I had encountered at that age. Because genre fiction allows us to ask questions about ourselves and our world that we might not otherwise explore. Stories that defy the boundaries of our present technology, and the worlds we know, can raise important questions about who we are, what we value, and where we should and should not allow innovation to take us. As MJ wrote in Astrotopia : The place of our most poetic imaginations and our most obsessive calculations, space is the place where art, science, literature, technology, and religion all attract and repel one another in a vortical frenzy, promising this or that path toward enlightenment, that or this more perfect existence. Indulging the question of what if allows our imaginations to make new journeys and discoveries, and I believe in the importance of those odysseys. That belief only amplifies my contempt for people like Musk and Bezos, who would exploit our sense of wonder, and our hope for the future, to ensure our cooperation with their late capitalist agendas. The good news is that I believe in our capacity to tell better stories. But what does that work look like in practice? And how do we address the religion-shaped hole in people’s lives that people like Musk and Bezos are exploiting with cult-ish ideas and fantasies about space colonization? Well, we will be talking more about that in an upcoming episode, when I’ll be in conversation with Aaron Goggans, the “Dream Gardener” of the WildSeed Society . I’m also interested in hearing your ideas about the narrative work ahead of us, so if you’re on Facebook, be sure to join the Movement Memos Discussion Group , so we can reflect on these ideas together. I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I’ll see you in the streets. Show Notes Referenced:
“The real threat of these systems is what it will mean for our power,” says Paris Marx. “How are these tools going to be used to increase the power of employers and of management once again, and to be used against workers,” asks Paris Marx. In this episode of “Movement Memos,” Marx and host Kelly Hayes break down the hype and potential of artificial intelligence, and what we should really be worried about. Note: This a rush transcript and has been lightly edited for clarity. Copy may not be in its final form. Kelly Hayes: Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about organizing, solidarity and the work of making change. I’m your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. This week, we are talking about AI, and what activists and organizers should understand about this emerging technology. In the last year, we have been inundated with hype and predictions of transformation and doom regarding artificial intelligence. In January 2023, ChatGPT had racked up 100 million active users, only two months after its launch, as mesmerized journalists published accounts of their interactions with the product. For a time, ChatGPT was hailed as the fastest-growing consumer application in history, although desktop usage of the app declined by almost 10 percent in June , with some users complaining that ChatGPT has produced lower quality content over time. Economists with Goldman Sachs have predicted that AI could eliminate as many as 300 million jobs over the next decade, and some tech leaders warn that artificial intelligence could eliminate the human race altogether. So, is AI really poised to kill our jobs and annihilate us as a species? A statement from industry leaders, published by the Center for AI Safety on May 30, stated , “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.” Signatories for that statement included Bill Gates; Sam Altman, who is the CEO of OpenAI; and Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind. Sam Altman has also stated that he doesn’t “think we’ll want to go back,” once AI has revolutionized our economy. So some of the same people who are telling us that artificial intelligence will eliminate millions of jobs and potentially wipe out humanity are also telling us that it will transform the world for the better. So what the hell is actually going on with this technology? And what do activists and organizers need to understand about it? Today, we will be hearing from Paris Marx. Paris is the host of one of my favorite podcasts, “Tech Won’t Save Us,” and they also write for Disconnect , a newsletter for people who want a critical perspective on Silicon Valley and what it’s doing to the world. They’re also the author of Road to Nowhere: What Silicon Valley Gets Wrong about the Future of Transportation . In this episode, Paris is going to help separate the reality of AI, and what this technology can and cannot do, from the nonsense and sci-fi tropes being churned out by the Silicon Valley hype machine. This episode follows our recent conversation with Émile Torres about longtermism , a cult-ish ideology that is running rampant in the tech world. While you don’t have to listen to that episode first, I do recommend circling back, if you haven’t checked out our conversation with Émile, because these subjects connect in really important ways. As we are going to discuss, AI is definitely overhyped, but the tech industry is, in fact, shaping and reshaping our world in disturbing ways. To fight back, we need to understand the ideas and technology that are driving these changes. I am grateful for the opportunity to dive into these subjects, because I’ve been alarmed by some of the misinformation that organizers and activists are being hit with around these issues. Irresponsible coverage of AI, which we’ll talk more about in this episode, is just one example of why we need independent news and analysis, now more than ever. I’m able to put together episodes like this one thanks to Truthout , a nonprofit news organization with no ads, no paywalls and no corporate sponsors, that isn’t beholden to any of the people whose shenanigans I call out on this show. With this podcast, we are working to provide a resource for political education that can help empower activists and organizers. If you want to support the show, you can sign up for Truthout’s newsletter or make a donation at truthout.org. You can also subscribe to “Movement Memos” or write a review on Apple or Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts. Sharing your favorite episodes is also a big help. Remember, Truthout is a union shop and we have the best family and sick leave policies in the industry. A lot of publications have gone under or suffered layoffs in recent years. At Truthout , we’ve managed to dodge those bullets, and we have our recurring donors to thank for that. So, I want to give a special shout out to our sustainers. Thanks for your support, and for believing in what we do. And with that, I hope you enjoy the show. Paris Marx : My name is Paris Marx. My pronouns are he or they, whichever you prefer. I host a podcast called “Tech Won’t Save Us.” I also write a lot about technology from a critical left perspective for a bunch of different publications, everything from Time Magazine to Wired to Jacobin , all over the place, and I also wrote a book called Road to Nowhere: What Silicon Valley Gets Wrong about the Future of Transportatio n. With regard to AI, obviously, it’s something that I am trying to understand like everyone else, and so since I guess last year, I’ve been interviewing and talking to a lot of critics and skeptics of AI to learn more about their perspectives and what is going on now that we see this kind of generative AI boom. So there’s a ton of hype around AI right now. I don’t need to tell you that. Everyone will have seen it. All the stories about ChatGPT that we’ve seen over the past six months or so, along with the image-generation tools and everyone kind of going crazy about open AI and Sam Altman doing his tour around the world. These things are getting a lot of media attention, and there’s a lot of reporting and a lot of writing about the potential consequences of all of these technologies, and what we’re led to believe is that this is some massive new advance in AI technology and in the digital technologies that surround us, and that it’s going to mean huge changes for how we work and how we live, and nothing is ever going to be the same again. I think that that is a huge overstatement that works for the companies, right? That works for the industry. What we know is that the tech industry was really struggling previous to this kind of AI boom. Not only did we see the crash of the crypto boom that everyone might remember with the cryptocurrencies and the NFTs, but also the big push for the metaverse to be the next big thing really kind of fizzled out as a lot of people just found it to be a joke, and so at the same time, interest rates have been rising. This is something people will be very familiar with, but that also jeopardized the model that the tech industry had used for the past 15 years in order to forward its business models and its kind of global domination. Those low interest rates allowed for easy access to capital that was useful in rapidly growing these businesses even if they were making losses and not turning a profit. And so the industry was in this really difficult situation. People probably remember the stories of layoffs and things like that from earlier this year, and so the AI boom comes along not to be this big technological revolution, but to kind of save the industry from a business standpoint because by having this boom, by having this excitement around AI, it drives a new wave of investment even though there’s all these other kind of factors that are going on that are kind of negative for the industry. And so I think that that is the best way to understand AI — not as this kind of massive technological transformation, but as a real business move in order to resuscitate and keep the industry going, so that it’s not going to enter this really prolonged kind of downward spiral. And so in order to get us to buy into these things, and in order to get us to believe these things, the industry has to put out really over-exaggerated narratives to make it seem like these technologies are going to transform the world. There’s also this idea that these AI technologies, these chatbots, are this big step forward that means that we’re just on the cusp of artificial general intelligence, which is this idea that the computers are going to reach the level where they’re at parity with humans in terms of their ability to think and process, like they kind of gain a consciousness in a sense, right? And so people like Sam Altman and people who are in the industry are making us believe that we are right on the cusp of achieving this because that works for their business goals, right? So that, instead of paying attention to the real consequences of these AI tools: how they can be used in welfare systems to discriminate against people, how they might be used to encourage the privatization of education or health care services, many other ways that they can affect our lives in a really negative way without us realizing that that’s even happening. And instead of saying, “Let’s focus the regulatory lens and the critical scrutiny lens on those types of things, those really real ways that they can affect our lives,” this kind of narrative about artificial general intelligence says, “Don’t look at those things, but instead look to the possible future where these intelligent machines could become our overseers or our overlords and might eradicate humanity.” And it’s total fantasy, but it works for them to make us believe that. KH : Now, if you listened to our episode with Émile Torres, you may be wondering whether some of these tech characters actually believe their own hype, when it comes to AI. After all, the idea of creating an AI superintelligence is a big part of the longtermist ideology, which is basically the Scientology of Silicon Valley. Some people in the tech world do seem to believe that artificial general intelligence could ultimately dominate and destroy us all. As Survival of the Richest author Doug Rushkoff told The Guardian in May: They’re afraid that their little AIs are going to come for them. They’re apocalyptic, and so existential, because they have no connection to real life and how things work. They’re afraid the AIs are going to be as mean to them as they’ve been to us. So, some tech leaders may believe that superintelligence is a threat, just as some colonizers might have believed Manifest Destiny was real, but what matters is how these ideas function in the world, who they empower, and who they dehumanize and disempower. So, I want to go ahead and stick a fork in the question of what tech leaders believe, with regard to AI, by arguing that it doesn’t matter what they believe. When ideas are weaponized, motives and actions matter more than what people think of the weapons they’re wielding. I also want to note that, when it comes to the damage that powerful people want to cause, lofty justifications usually follow existing projects or desires. So with longtermism, we have a sort of techy religion that’s been built around certain pursuits, and with the general public, we have the narrative of an angry, inevitable, future god, in the form of artificial general intelligence, that tech leaders supposedly want to protect us from. As religiosity goes, it really is one hell of a scam, regardless of whether cult-y tech leaders believe in what they’re selling. On a practical level, as Paris explained, the supposed threat of an AI superintelligence is used to keep us mesmerized, so that we won’t get riled up about how these technologies are being deployed against us in real time. Because algorithms already control our lives, in so many ways, and by building up some future boogeyman that tech leaders supposedly want to protect us from, they are hoping to distract us from the reality of what this tech is and is not doing in the world today. PM : There’s a bunch of AI that surrounds us every single day; if you think about when you’re typing on your phone, autocorrect comes up, and that is AI, right? So there are really kind of general basic things that are also artificial intelligence or would fit under that term. I think that the term itself is misleading because it makes us believe that these machines are intelligent in some sort of way, which I would argue is not the case. They’re just models that these people have put together that make predictions and things like that based on the data that they’re trained on. So when we look at what these tools are actually doing, the chatbots are based on large language models, and basically, these things have been around for a while, but what has been achieved with these ones, part of the reason that they are getting so much attention in this moment and that they seem so much better than in the past, is because they have access to a lot of centralized computing power, and they have access to a lot of data on which to be trained, right? People are probably familiar with Microsoft’s Cloud infrastructure. Amazon and Google have them as well, that are these data centers all over the world that give them access to a lot of computing power. And so these companies are using this in order to train these models, and at the same time, they have kind of scraped the open internet to take hundreds of millions or billions of words and images, and things like that on which to train these models. And because they’re using so much computing power and because they’re using so much data, certainly they can churn out things that these tools have not been able to in the past, but that’s not because they’re so much better. It’s just because they’re using more resources to do it, and they have more data that they’re trained on. That doesn’t mean that they’re so much more intelligent than previous machines or anything like that. It’s just that we’re kind of increasing the scale at which this operates, and so they’re able to achieve some new things as a result. KH : One reality that tech leaders are seeking to obscure when they hype up AI doomsday scenarios is that large language learning models are already contributing to one of the greatest threats humanity is faced with today: climate chaos. As Paris has explained, we are talking about existing technologies that have a much greater extractive capacity than the average chatbot. That extractive capacity is, itself, powered by more material forms of extraction. PM : One of the things that we often think about — and I think the term “cloud” hides it from us, hides the real impact from us — is that when we think about these computer systems, when we go onto the web, when we access a Netflix movie or we access some files that we have in the cloud, that those aren’t just kind of in some ethereal place that has no impact. They’re in one of these large data centers that are filled with computers that are holding all of this information, and they require a lot of energy in order to power them, but they also require a lot of water in order to cool them, right? And so as these kind of generative AI models, these chatbots like ChatGPT or these image-generation systems become more popular, they also require more resources in order to power them, and so that will require kind of more data centers, and more energy, and more computer parts and more water to keep all these things going. And I think the other piece of it that’s really important when we think about extractiveness and when we think about the extractive nature of these products is not just resource extraction in the sense of mining to create the computers, for the energy creation and also for the water that’s needed for those, but also extractive from the point of data, right? Because they’re basically going out to the open web where all of us have been sharing things for the past several decades, and they’re scraping all of that information and all of those posts, and all of those images, and using it to train their models. And they’re saying that this should be okay, that they should not be held to account for that. In some cases, like in the case of OpenAI, they’re not even telling us what it has specifically been trained on. They’re trying to keep that a secret, and so we’ve seen a number of lawsuits that have been launched in recent months challenging these companies on the data that they used to train these models, saying that they’ve used copyrighted material, saying that they’ve used people’s private information that they’ve scraped off of the web, and challenging their ability to actually just take all of our data in that way and use it how they see fit. KH : According to The Washington Post , a large data center’s cooling systems can consume “anywhere between 1 million and 5 million gallons of water a day — as much as a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people.” Phoenix, Arizona, the fifth-largest city in the United States, is home to data centers owned by Apple and Google, among others, and is experiencing a decades-long “ megadrought ,” and a historic heat wave. According to the Arizona Department of Water Resources , there simply isn’t enough water beneath the Phoenix metropolitan area to meet projected demands over the next 100 years. In total, Google’s global data centers used over 4.3 billion gallons of water in 2021. The so-called Cloud now has a larger carbon footprint than every major airline combined. Data centers also contribute 2 percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to the minerals that are mined to produce the hardware used in data centers, AI technologies also contribute to other forms of extraction. While some claim that artificial intelligence can help solve the climate crisis, Dan McQuillan explains in his book, Resisting AI: An Anti-fascist Approach to Artificial Intelligence , why the opposite is true. McQuillan writes: Amazon aggressively markets its AI to the oil and gas industry with programmes like ‘Predicting the Next Oil Field in Seconds with Machine Learning’ while Microsoft holds events such as ‘Empowering Oil & Gas with AI’.… Despite bandying about the idea that AI is a key part of the solution to the climate crisis, the real modus operandi of the AI industry is its offer to accelerate and optimize fossil fuel extraction and climate precarity. So how many data centers will it take to power the so-called AI revolution? Given what we know about the extractive nature of data centers, and the industries AI would support, the environmental costs of powering a world run on AI appear downright incalculable. And while these environmental concerns are troubling enough, AI threatens our well-being in a number of other disturbing ways. PM : So in the narratives around AI, these companies like to have us focus on the future and the potential consequences that could come of artificial general intelligence, and these machines becoming so powerful that they can overtake humans and stuff like that, right? And that distracts us from the real harms that can come of these things that are actually very important and very consequential for people, not just in the United States, but around the world. And so I think people will be familiar with things like predictive policing, where AI tools were used to kind of figure out statistically, predicatively who might commit a crime into the future, so that the police can go and try to stop it before it happens, right? And these systems are very racist, are very inaccurate, because they’re trained on past data. So if the police have spent a lot of time policing particular neighborhoods like Black neighborhoods and arrested a disproportionate number of people in those neighborhoods, then the models will suggest that the people who are going to commit crimes in the future are those types of people in those types of locations in the city, and ignore other people who might also be committing crimes but are not the types of people who are generally arrested by police. You think white collar criminals and things like that, right? So that’s one piece of it, but I would say that it extends much further than that, and that the risk is much greater. There’s an example in Australia that I think is actually very telling, where the government down there was looking to make their welfare system more efficient, and to find people who were receiving welfare benefits and they shouldn’t have been receiving them. So they implemented this AI tool that was termed down there, “Robodebt.” And what happened was this tool matched up people’s income submissions with the amount of money that they were receiving through the program and sent out a ton of letters to people all around the country, expecting them to pay back welfare payments that had been made to them — social assistance payments and things like that. And after years of fighting and litigation, what came out was that this AI tool was flawed. The way it was calculating this was not accurate, and so it was telling a bunch of people who had legitimate reasons to be on welfare or social assistance that they had to actually pay that money back, and that caused a lot of harm in those people’s lives. It caused them a lot of stress and a lot of heartache. It obviously caused people to lose homes and things like that, but it also caused people to commit suicide because they just saw that there was no hope and no way forward for them now that the government was taking them on, and taking the last bit of kind of money they had, or cutting them off from support that they deserved and that they should have. And ultimately, the government had to pay I believe it was $7 billion in compensation to these people and shut down the program, but we’ve seen these types of systems rolled out in other parts of the world as well. In welfare systems, we see very commonly now that using AI is becoming more common in immigration systems and in visa applications, so it’s used to judge people’s submissions for work visas, and travel visas, and things like green cards and whatnot, and that is becoming a serious issue as well, because again, these systems are often very racist and discriminatory. So these are some of the real implications, some of the aspects of AI being integrated into the various systems that people depend on that can have life-altering consequences, but that people like Sam Altman and these powerful people in the tech industry are really not interested in and don’t want us to think about, because that might make us have some second thoughts on the kind of AI revolution in the world that they are trying to create, because it shows that they’re actually very real flaws with these systems once they are rolled out into the real world rather than just kind of existing in their kind of imaginaries of what the future might look like. KH : As Paris explains, the so-called revolution that AI offers is really a hardening and enhancement of the status quo. In the same way that neoliberalism encases markets, protecting corporations from the interference of governments, and from democracy itself, AI encases systemic and bureaucratic violence. Compassion, reason, ethics and other human concerns, which might, at times, interrupt the perpetration of systemic violence, become the work of algorithms that feel nothing and cannot be reasoned with. Algorithmic governance, in effect, amplifies and speeds up everything that’s wrong with our social systems and institutions. Proponents of these technologies are also working to erode notions of what it means to be human, in order to argue that their souped-up chatbots — or what some experts have called “stochastic parrots” — are just like us. In December 2022, Sam Altman tweeted, “i am a stochastic parrot, and so r u.” PM : It’s so disappointing to see people like Sam Altman go on Twitter and claim that we are all stochastic parrots, right? And this is this term that was coined by a bunch of AI researchers , including Emily Bender and Timnit Gebru, in saying that these systems are basically like a parrot, right? It takes in this data, and it will kind of spit out similar types of things as the data that has been given to it, right? It’s not intelligent. It’s just kind of repeating words, and sometimes that can make us believe that it is intelligent because it is kind of spitting things back at us, and we might want to believe that there’s something more there. And so when people like Sam Altman say that they are also a stochastic parrot, that humans are stochastic parrots, what they’re doing is they’re devaluing human intelligence and what it means to be human to try to make them more equivalent to computers, so it’s easier for them to argue that actually these AI tools, this artificial intelligence — which again, I think is a very misleading term — is close to becoming equivalent with human intelligence, right? And these computers are going to match us very soon. I think many people rightfully argue that that is very unlikely to happen, and that we’re not going to see that at any time in the future, but their ideology is kind of caught up in believing this and in believing that the computers are about to match us, and they also have this belief that we should want that to happen. There’s kind of a transhumanist belief here that someone like Altman, of course, has in investments in companies that want to ensure that people’s minds are uploaded to computers, and he, I believe, even has a reservation or something to try to have this happen, I guess, or to have his body frozen, I think, when he dies until the point when it’s actually possible for him to upload his mind to the computer — something weird like that, right? And so these people have these really odd beliefs, as we’ve talked about, but it also shapes how they see the world. And I think that the real problem there, if we’re thinking in the big picture, is that it leads us to not value the unique things that humans can do and that we should want them to continue doing. If we think of something like art and creativity, for example, these people who are developing these tools want us to replace the creation of art, want us to replace writing with chatbots and image-generation tools, and instead have humans kind of do much more mundane labor, of kind of checking over these systems and whatnot. So instead of us creating this art and doing these creative works that are based on our kind of experiences of the world and the various things that we’ve experienced in our lives and kind of reflecting that in the artistic creations that then a bunch of people enjoy — and I think that’s one of the things that we value about human society is kind of art and creativity, and things like that. Well, they would prefer to see that taken over by machines, and they don’t see any particular problem with that because it will just allow these machines to churn out more things that look like art but don’t have that kind of soul that would be given to a piece of creative work that is made by a human, I would argue. Yeah, and I could say so much more, but I think that those are some real concerns with their approach to it. KH : If what you’re hearing in this episode seems to contradict something you’ve read in a major publication, that’s likely because coverage of artificial intelligence has largely been incompetent, at best, and, at worst, highly unethical. PM : I think the media reporting on AI is often very irresponsible. We do occasionally get stories that do present a more critical perspective on these things, and I always welcome that, but I would say that the majority of reporting is very uncritical and is kind of repeating the narratives that these CEOs and these companies want us to believe, basically: you know, the things like artificial general intelligence, and how these systems are going to be a big threat to us, and all the ways that they’re going to make society a better place, and blah, blah, blah, right? All the things that are coming from these companies and that these CEOs want us to believe, but I think that what we’re really lacking then is a proper understanding of how these technologies actually work, what their potential real impacts are on the world, and how we should actually be thinking about them, right? Because when the media coverage just reflects what the companies are saying for the most part, then we don’t get that critical understanding that allows us to do a real assessment of what these technologies might mean for us, because what we’re always presented is that they’re going to have all these huge effects on our lives, whether they’re positive or negative, because in this case, I would argue that even the negative scenarios — like artificial general intelligence and potential robots or AIs kind of taking over humanity — also really work for the companies and their PR narratives. And so what we’re missing there is a media that is able to challenge those things and to present us with alternative perspectives. And I think that that happens for a number of reasons, not just in the tech media but in the mainstream media as well. So one of the things that we’ve seen over the past number of years and the past few decades, I guess, is that the funding for media and journalism has really been hollowed out in part because it has moved online. You lose the classifieds because there are just free websites where people do that kind of stuff now, so newspapers don’t get the revenue from that, but also digital advertising is basically controlled by Google and Facebook, and to a lesser degree, Amazon. And so newspapers and media organizations get less advertising revenue, which was kind of the core of their business model, and so when they have less revenue, that means that they not only need to continue churning out stories in order to get people to be reading what’s on their website, but they also don’t have the time to do the investigative work that would be necessary for a more critical assessment of these technologies. I think that part of it as well is that in the tech industry, there’s a really strong desire for access, especially in the tech publications. So if you’re going to write critically about some of these major companies, then you might be excluded from press events, from things like Apple Keynotes where they launch new products, and so that will mean that you won’t be able to access those things and do the types of coverage that other outlets have. And I think as well, some people who go into reporting on tech and writing about tech just kind of generally have a positive view of technology, and that’s part of the reason they want to enter that sphere anyway. And so they come in with these kind of preconceived notions of what the tech industry is, and that it’s doing positive things in the world, and that new technology is equivalent to progress, and all these sorts of ideological ideas that we have about tech, and that then gets reflected in their reporting. So unfortunately, I think that the coverage we get of AI is just reflective of a broader trend in tech coverage that is very boosterish, that is very positive, that is not nearly critical enough, and that leaves the public unprepared to actually judge what these technologies might mean for them because it always seems that the tech industry is doing really positive things in revolutionizing society, even when we can see that that is not what the real impact tends to be. KH : I have previously mentioned Dan McQuillan’s book, Resisting AI , which is a really great read that I think everyone should check out. When I first picked up that book, my take on artificial intelligence was that these technologies were inevitable, and probably, unstoppable. You may have heard similar arguments, and you may hold these beliefs yourself. You may also be thinking, as I once did, that, under the right circumstances, and in the right hands, these technologies could, in fact, transform our lives for the better. I understand the appeal of this idea, but having researched this technology, what it’s doing and where it’s heading, I no longer hold this view. PM : I think Dan McQuillan’s book, Resisting AI , is really informative, and it was interesting to me when I spoke to him to interview him for my podcast that he explained that initially, he set out to write a book that was about AI for good. I believe that was the initial title. And as he got into his research, he realized that actually there is no AI for good, and we need to resist AI, and that kind of resulted in the shift that happened in the title of the book, but also the content of the book in terms of what he was arguing. And I think that he has a really persuasive argument when you think about the impacts of AI on society — the real impacts, right? Not the things that kind of Sam Altman is pointing us toward and Elon Musk are pointing us toward, but the things that we were talking about with regard to the way that it can be deployed in welfare systems, and in immigration systems, and in policing systems, and all of these other ways that it can really affect people, right? And really shape people’s lives in a really significant way, but also where they are disempowered from being able to take actions that would change those sorts of things. Because when they’re built into the systems and when your life is governed by AI systems, you have a lot less power over your own life because of how these technologies can shape just everything that you interact with, and you might not be able to access a human who can go around the system or fix the system because there becomes this kind of inbuilt belief that if the system is saying something, then the system must be right because it’s a computer, and why would a computer be wrong, right? So when it comes to AI for good, and the ways that it might be able to be used in a more positive way, I think it’s possible, right? I think of things that are much more mundane, like autocorrect tools and whatnot. Obviously, as I was talking about, AI is deployed in many different ways in society. Some of those ways are much more mundane, but others can have a lot of real impacts for everyone, basically, but especially the most marginalized and least powerful people in society who have very little ability to push back on these things, and these tools and these systems. So I think that my concern is more that we live under capitalism right now. Capitalism shapes how technology is developed to serve its need for profit, and for control of workers and of the public by the state, and so the way that we see AI technologies developed and rolled out aligns with those capitalist goals and aligns with the interests of those corporations and of particular governments, not the needs and the will of the general public, right? And so I think that McQuillan makes very understandable arguments in arguing that we should be resisting these AI tools, and that these AI tools can be used as part of this wider shift toward fascism and kind of fascist politics that we’re seeing in society right now, because you can very clearly see how they can be used to kind of rank people, to classify people, to control the way that we access services. I think that there are a lot of very dangerous ways that AI can be used to enhance these types of politics. And I think that if we’re thinking about it from a left-wing perspective, I don’t think the argument that we should encourage the development of AI because at some point in the future, if we have a socialist government, it might be able to be used for good if we can seize the tech and use it in a different way. I just don’t think that is a compelling argument in a moment where we know that we live under capitalism, we know that our politics is veering to the right, we know that we’re facing a lot of crises in the future when we think about the climate crisis, and what is that going to mean for the politics of our societies as we move forward? And so I think it makes a very good case that we should be opposing AI right now, and we should be opposing the rollout of these systems. Ultimately, when we think about the net impact of these technologies, it’s going to be a net negative for the vast majority of people in society who are not the Sam Altmans and the tech billionaires. KH : Now, I’m not saying you’re one of the bad guys if you’re using auto transcription tools or other technologies that fall under the AI umbrella. The truth is, it’s very hard to get away from these applications. Our society has been structured to make us reliant upon a lot of things that are ultimately bad for the world, and to make us feel that those things are essential and inevitable. And yet, we know that our ways of living must ultimately be transformed, or most life on Earth will be destroyed — not by some scary super-intelligent AI, but by the extractive workings of capitalism. So I would ask you to open your mind a bit, and consider that we cannot allow notions of technological dependency or inevitability to govern our lives or our world. Just as you can own a car, and still rage against the oil industry, you can use autocorrect and still question what’s happening with AI. I also want to point out that we have been set up to become dependent on AI in really disturbing ways, and that some of the vulnerabilities this technology exploits point to the damage capitalism has already done in our lives. Some people, for example, have suggested that AI presents a solution for loneliness among elderly people, suggesting that AI pets and companions can provide “joy” and a therapeutic presence for older people. Loneliness and abandonment are massive issues in our society, and around the world. What we really need is each other, but we are being encouraged to engage with chatbots and simulations that will either leave us unsatisfied, or plunge us further into our own fractured realities. Why? Because Goldman Sachs estimates that generative AI could ultimately increase gross domestic product by 7 percent, or almost $7 trillion. PM : I get very angry about the tech industry and the ways that they affect our society and the ways that they shape our conversation and how we think about it. But also seeing some of the narratives around AI also just makes me profoundly sad when I think about the type of society that it is creating and that it is suggesting for how we move forward, and that is a society that is very cold, that is very lacking in human interaction, because everything goes through these computer systems, and that is what we are encouraged to do because that is what works for the business models and the goals of these companies, right? Because they make money when we interact with computer systems and with apps, not when we interact with other people. And so they don’t want to have us do that. They want to have us stay home and ask our chatbot for advice, and have a chat with our chatbot; and order things from Amazon or from Uber, and have it dropped off; and just stay home, and consume our Netflix, and do our work, and all this kind of stuff, and it’s a very kind of just terrible vision for what the future should look like. And I think it builds on existing issues that are in society when we think about, obviously, the crisis of loneliness and how people have fewer interactions with the people around them than I think we would imagine in the past, and that we would imagine a healthy society having in part because of the eradication of communal space and public space, and how that has been privatized over the past number of decades, but also how we’ve lost the number of community organizations that used to bring people together, and that also goes along with kind of the suburbanization and the types of communities that we’ve created where everyone or a lot of people lived much further from one another. And the transport system is basically reliant on cars and otherwise is very degraded. So in order to get anywhere, you have to get in a car, and kind of wait in traffic, and buy expensive gasoline, and all this kind of stuff instead of living close to the people you care about and the services that you depend on where you can quickly access those things through public transit and cycling. It’s a very different vision of what a society can look like, but you can see how these tech tools then take advantage of the type of environment that we have created, and they want to further this. And I think that, just to make a final point, when you listen to people like Sam Altman and these people who are developing these tools, they very clearly say that they see these chatbots serving many roles in society, right? That they see them becoming our teachers, and that they see them becoming our doctors, and that they see them becoming our kind of psychologists or therapists, and all this kind of stuff. And it always brings to mind a couple of things to me. First of all, back in the , we think about AI as being this very new technology, right? But there was this guy called Joseph Weizenbaum who was working on AI systems all the way back then, and he developed this chatbot called ELIZA, and it was based on this model of a psychotherapist. And so it was programmed that when you would interact with it and type in your little command, it would kind of spit back out a question that was taking your words and kind of reframing them for you. And it was a very simple thing, but he was just trying to demonstrate how these computers could do that. But what he found very quickly was that when people interacted with this chatbot — this very basic rudimentary thing that could not think for itself, that had no ability to think, that was just using the prompts that he had coded in order to ask people questions based on what they were saying — that people felt like they were actually interacting with somebody. And some of the people even wanted him to leave the room while they were talking to this computer system, because they felt like it was listening, and they were telling it important details and felt like they were getting something out of it, which I think displays something quite worrying, right? That instead of interacting with a person, we interact with a computer, and we want to believe that it’s listening, and that it’s interacting with us, and that it understands us when it actually doesn’t do that. It’s just trained on these algorithms that have certainly become more advanced because they’re trained on more data and have more computing power, but they still don’t understand what we’re actually communicating, and they are not actually communicating back to us. It’s just a much more advanced form of autocorrect and what they’re spitting at us. And I think that the issue there is that in believing that there is intelligence, then we accept this idea that it’s going to start replacing things like teachers or things like doctors when it’s not actually going to do that, but then it empowers companies and the governments, of course, to further push down on the wages of teachers, to keep fighting teachers unions, to keep trying to privatize education. And this won’t affect the Sam Altmans of the world or the children of Elon Musk, who has many, many children, but it will affect poor people, marginalized people, the people who can’t afford really high-quality private education, who rely on the public school system, or who don’t have the greatest health insurance and all this kind of stuff. They will be the people who will be stuck with these chatbots that will deliver much inferior service to what they might get right now, but we’re being told that this is a positive thing that we should accept because it works for these tech companies, but also the other companies in these industries that will profit from it as well. And just to kind of close off this thought, there was a story just the other day because Google is working on a medical AI bot, or system, or chatbot, or whatnot, and one of the senior researchers at Google said that he wouldn’t want this medical chatbot to be used for his family’s health journey, but he was excited to see it rolled out in developing countries and on other kind of marginalized people, which I think really shows you the perspective that these people have: Don’t expect these technologies to be deployed on us, the wealthy people of the world, but we’re more than happy to deploy them on you regardless of the consequences. KH : Something Paris has written about, that I think is really important to understand, is that we have seen the kind of hype we are witnessing around AI before. PM : So I think that this is quite relevant to what is happening at the moment. What really got me interested in criticizing the tech industry was what happened in the mid-2010s when we had the last kind of boom of hype around automation and AI, and people might remember that in those years, the story was that the technologies were advancing very rapidly, and that we were about to have kind of robots and AI tools that were going to take over a ton of the work that was going to be done by all of us. And that half of jobs were going to be wiped out, and all this kind of stuff, and there were going to be no more truck drivers and no more taxi drivers because self-driving cars were going to replace them. And when you went into a fast food restaurant or a coffee shop, you were going to have a robot making your food instead of a person. All of these workers that we interacted with and that we are were going to be replaced by computers in the next few years, right? And that led to this concern about what is society going to look like when this all happens? Are we going to need a universal basic income? Are people just going to be destitute? Are we going to have fully automated luxury communism? Right? All of these narratives were happening in that moment, and what we saw was that all of the technology that all of these narratives were kind of assuming was just going to take over and have these effects never really came through and never developed like these tech companies were leading us to believe. So we never had this mass eradication of jobs. What we did have was these tools further empowering employers and managers against workers, so that they could reclassify workers from employees to contractors like we’ve seen in the gig economy with things like Uber and delivery services; or rolling out more automated systems to have more algorithmic management of workers that we see most prominently in things like Amazon warehouses where the workers have very little power, are constantly tracked by the little guns that they use to scan the items. And of course as a result, they have very little control over the conditions of their work. It’s very hard for them to take bathroom breaks. You’ve probably seen the stories about people saying they have to pee in bottles because they can’t actually go to the bathroom at Amazon facilities, and certainly not when they’re doing delivery driving. And we assume that the kind of real benefits of the Amazon model or the real innovation of the Amazon model was how it’s using these technologies in this logistics system in order to reduce costs, but one of the real innovations of the Amazon model is to take warehouse workers, which was previously a unionized and quite well paid profession, and basically turn it into something more of akin to a minimum wage worker that gets paid much less and does not have a union except in one warehouse in Staten Island, of course, or delivery drivers, these deliveries are usually done by USPS, which is unionized, or UPS, which is unionized and might be going on strike soon, but instead Amazon is increasingly shifting over to drivers that it controls, that are hired by what they call “delivery service partners,” so they’re not directly employed by Amazon, but they’re not paid very well. They certainly can’t unionize, because what we’ve seen in a couple parts of the country now is that where they have tried to unionize, Amazon has cut the contract of those delivery service partners to cut them off and just get someone else, and now we also see that moving into airline delivery and freight. So Amazon has been expanding its logistics network of air shipping, and what it also does there is also to hire pilots through third party companies as well, so that the pilots are still unionized, but they’re not directly controlled by Amazon. So if they do try to demand better wages and conditions, Amazon can cut that contract and contract from a different company instead. So that’s a long way of saying that this hype and this excitement around automation and AI didn’t actually eradicate a ton of jobs, but ensured that workers have less power to push back against their employers and management. And so when I look at what is happening now with this boom and this excitement around generative AI, we’re seeing some similar narratives around what it might mean for the public, how it’s going to transform everything, how it’s going to make things more efficient, how it might take away a lot of jobs, all this kind of stuff, but I think it’s very unlikely that any of that happens. And what I am actually watching for instead is: how are these tools going to be used to increase the power of employers and of management once again, and to be used against workers? And I think you can already see how they can be used to increase surveillance of workers, especially in this moment where we have more people working from home. And so now if you have these generative AI systems, they can do more tracking of your computer and what you’re actually doing at work, but you can also see how they can be deployed in such a way to ensure that companies don’t need as many workers or don’t need as skilled workers as they had in the past. So you can use an image-generating system or a chatbot to churn out some written words or some images. They might not be perfect, but then instead of hiring a writer or a graphic designer to make those things, all that you need to do now is get someone on contract or get someone to do a very short job of doing a bit of editing on what the AI has generated in terms of words or images, and not design something from scratch, so you can cut down that cost and you don’t need to rely on them as much. So I think that these are the things that we should be paying much more attention to — not the ways that AI might transform everything, or how it might lead to artificial general intelligence that might cause a threat to humanity or whatever. I think that the real threat of these systems is what it will mean for our kind of power, and being able to increase the power of the tech billionaires and the companies that control these technologies, but also how they can transform welfare systems and other public services that we rely on to make them much more aggressive toward us, much more discriminatory, and basically make our lives much more difficult to lead. KH : Well, I am so grateful for this conversation, and I am also really grateful for “Tech Won’t Save Us,” and Paris’s newsletter Disconnect. We’ll have links to both of those in the show notes of this episode, on our website at truthout.org. Paris has really helped shape my analysis by offering some essential critiques of the tech industry, and by introducing me to some really important resources and books. In fact, I am quite sure that this block of episodes we’re doing — on what activists need to know about longtermism, AI, and the kind of storytelling we need in these times — wouldn’t exist without Paris and their work, so I just wanted to name my gratitude for that. As we wrap up today, I also wanted to share another quote from Dan McQuillan’s book, Resisting AI. McQuillan writes: Rather than being an apocalyptic technology, AI is more aptly characterized as a form of supercharged bureaucracy that ramps up everyday cruelties, such as those in our systems of welfare. In general … AI doesn’t lead to a new dystopia ruled over by machines but an intensification of existing misery through speculative tendencies that echo those of finance capital. These tendencies are given a particular cutting edge by the way AI operates with and through race. AI is a form of computation that inherits concepts developed under colonialism and reproduces them as a form of race science. This is the payload of real AI under the status quo. McQuillan also explains in his book how AI serves “as a vector for normalizing specific kinds of responses to social instabilities,” which could make it a factor in the ascent of global fascism. As we’ve discussed here, AI supercharges and encases the functionality of systems. In a world where fascism is rising, we cannot ignore the role that these systems could ultimately play. I know these are heavy issues, and I am grateful to everyone who has been on this journey with us. In our next episode, we will discuss the religiosity of the new space race, and how we can counter narratives that center endless expansion and endless growth, while offering us nothing but a fantasy reboot of colonialism. For now, I want to remind you all that what we need to remake the world won’t be concocted in Silicon Valley. It will come from us, in the work we do together, building relationships, caring for and protecting one another, and fashioning new ways of living amid crisis. We are the hope we’re looking for. We just have to find each other, and work together, in order to realize that hope. I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today, and remember: Our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters.

Rather than ban neo-Nazis who are scaring advertisers off the platform, X is seemingly resorting to threats. Instead of banning neo-Nazis and white supremacists who have overrun Twitter (recently renamed X) and caused concerns for advertisers on the platform, the company is threatening advertisers, saying that if they don’t spend a certain amount of money each quarter, they could risk losing their verification and being impersonated on the platform. According to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal , X is warning brands that they will lose their check mark starting August 7 if they haven’t spent at least $1,000 on ads in the last 30 days or $6,000 on ads in the last 180 days. Losing their verification could be costly, as it could allow people to create accounts impersonating the brand, with potential consequences outside of the platform. A particularly well-known instance of this happened last year shortly after Elon Musk took over and made it so that anyone could obtain a blue check mark, a system that has been used for years to verify the identity of notable users’ accounts. In November, an account with a blue check mark pretending to be pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly made waves when it tweeted, “We are excited to announce insulin is free now.” Though the tweet was fake and was removed by Twitter hours later, the damage was already done — Eli Lilly pulled all of its advertising from the platform, lost billions of dollars from its market cap, and was forced to concede that the price of its insulin could stand to be lower. The threat conveniently comes as the company is also running a promotion around advertising, the emails showed, with a discount on video ads in the “Explore” tab, supposedly timed for the Women’s World Cup. It’s unclear how many brands X’s threat would affect, though Musk and X are at this point notorious for making promises that are never kept. The company is currently charging brands $1,000 a month for their check marks, though it has given a slate of the most-followed companies on the platform the check for free. X has been struggling with revenue ever since Musk took over — and, though he recently handed over the position of CEO to former NBC executive Linda Yaccarino, it seems as though his decision-making power still looms large over the platform. The rebrand to “X,” for instance, comes after Musk’s longtime obsession with the letter, and could cost the platform billions of dollars in brand recognition. Last week, Musk tweeted that the company is losing money due to a “~50 percent drop in advertising revenue.” As of February, more than half of the company’s previous top 1,000 advertisers stopped running ads on the website after Musk rolled back bans on people like Donald Trump and a host of neo-Nazis . In interviews in June, ad sales staff said that the rise in hate speech and pornography may be major factors driving advertisers off the platform. A flood of hateful content can make advertisers uneasy, fearing that their ad will be served directly next to posts spewing vitriol and hatred. Meanwhile, Musk has remained committed to personally spreading disinformation on the platform. On Tuesday, the right-wing billionaire tweeted a dubious conspiracy theory that the cardiac arrest of Bronny James, LeBron James’s son, could be linked to the COVID-19 vaccine. Users quickly attached a “Community Note” — X’s crowdsourced fact-checking system — to the tweet debunking the claim, saying that contracting the virus puts individuals at far greater risk of cardiological events than the vaccine does, but the fact check has since been removed.
“It's shaping our world right now,” says philosopher and historian Émile P. Torres. “It’s really important for people to understand what this bundle of ideologies is, because it’s become so hugely influential, and is shaping our world right now, and will continue to shape it for the foreseeable future,” says philosopher and historian Émile P. Torres. In this episode of “Movement Memos,” host Kelly Hayes and Torres discuss what activists should know about longtermism and TESCREAL. Music by Son Monarcas & David Celeste Note: This a rush transcript and has been lightly edited for clarity. Copy may not be in its final form. Kelly Hayes : Welcome to “Movement Memos,” a Truthout podcast about solidarity, organizing and the work of making change. I’m your host, writer and organizer Kelly Hayes. Today, we are talking about longtermism, and I can already hear some of you saying, “What the hell is that,” which is why it’s so important that we have this conversation. Longtermism is a school of thought that has gained popularity in Silicon Valley and much of the tech world, and it’s an ideology that’s come a long way in a fairly short period of time. Proponents say it’s “a set of ethical views concerned with protecting and improving the long-run future,” which sounds innocuous, or even good, really. But as we’ll discuss today, the ideas invoked by longtermists are cultish and often devalue the lives and liberty of people living in the present, and unfortunately, there is currently a lot of power and money behind them. In fact, computer scientist Timnit Gebru has argued that longtermism has become to the tech world what Scientology has long been to Hollywood — an almost inescapable network of influence that can govern the success or failure of adherents and non-adherents. One of the reasons I find longtermism frightening is that while it has gained a whole lot of financial, political and institutional momentum, some of the smartest people I know still don’t understand what it is, or why it’s a threat. I wanted to do something about that. So our first block of episodes this season will be an exploration of tech issues, including what activists and organizers need to know about artificial intelligence, and a discussion of the kind of storytelling we’ll need in order to resist the cult-ish ideas coming out of Silicon Valley and the tech world. Today, we will be hearing from Émile P. Torres. Émile is a philosopher and historian whose work focuses on existential threats to civilization and humanity. They have published on a wide range of topics, including machine superintelligence, emerging technologies, and religious eschatology, as well as the history and ethics of human extinction. Their forthcoming book is Human Extinction: A History of the Science and Ethics of Annihilation . I am a big fan of Émile’s work and I am excited for you all to hear their analysis of longtermism, and why we urgently need to educate fellow organizers about it. I feel sure that once most people understand what longtermism and the larger TESCREAL bundle of ideologies are all about (and we’ll explain what we mean by TESCREAL in just a bit), a lot of people will be concerned, appalled, or just plain disgusted, and understand that these ideas must be opposed. But when a movement backed by billionaires is gaining so much political, financial and institutional momentum without the awareness of most activists and everyday people, we’re basically sitting ducks. So I’m hoping that this episode can help us begin to think strategically about what it means to actively oppose these ideas. It’s great to be back, by the way, after a month-long break, during which I did a lot of writing. I also had the opportunity to support our friends in the Stop Cop City movement during their week of action in Atlanta. I am grateful to Truthout , for a schedule that allows me to balance my activism and my other writing projects with this show, which is so dear to my heart. This podcast is meant to serve as a resource for activists, organizers and educators, so that we can help arm people with the knowledge and analysis they need to make transformative change happen.

Torres, and I’m a philosopher and historian who’s based in Germany at Leibniz University. And my pronouns are they/them. Over the past decade plus, plus a few extra years, my work has focused on existential threats to humanity and civilization. For the longest time, I was very much aligned with a particular worldview, which I would now describe in terms of the TESCREAL bundle of ideologies. Over the past four or five years, I’ve become a quite vocal critic of this cluster of ideologies. So longtermism is an ideology that emerged out of the effective altruism community. The main aim of effective altruism is to maximize the amount of good that one does in the world. Ultimately, it’s to positively influence the greatest number of lives possible. So longtermism arose when effective altruists realized that humanity could exist in the universe for an extremely long amount of time. On earth, for example, we could persist for another billion years or so. The future number of humans, if that happens, could be really enormous. Carl Sagan in 1983 estimated that if we survive for just another 10 million years, there could be 500 trillion future people. That’s just an enormous number. You compare that to the number of people who have existed so far in human history, the estimate is about 117 billion. That’s it. So 500 trillion is just a much larger number, and that’s just the next 10 million years. On earth, we have another potentially billion years, during which we could survive. If we spread into space, and especially if we spread into space and become digital beings, then the future number of people could be astronomically larger. One estimate is within the Milky Way alone, there could be 10 to the 54 digital people. 10 to 54, that’s a one followed by 45 zeros. If we go beyond the Milky Way to other galaxies, we spread throughout the entire accessible universe, a lower bound estimate is 10 to the 58. Again, a one followed by 58 zeros, that’s how many future people there could be. So if you’re an effective altruist and your goal is to possibly influence the greatest number of people possible, and if most people who could exist will exist in the far future, once we colonize space and create these digital worlds in which trillions and trillions of people live, then you should be focused on the very far future. Even if there’s a small probability that you’ll influence in a positive way, 1% of these 10 to the 58 digital people in the future, that still is just a much greater value in expectation, so much greater expected value, than focusing on current people and contemporary problems. To put this in perspective, once again, there are 1.3 billion people today in multidimensional poverty. So lifting them out of poverty would be really good, but influencing in some beneficial way, 1% of 10 to the 58 future digital people in the universe, that is a much, much larger number. Longtermism was this idea that okay, maybe the best way to do the most good is to pivot our focus from contemporary issues towards the very far future. That’s not to say that contemporary issues should be ignored entirely. We should focus on them, only insofar as doing so might influence the very far future. Ultimately, it’s just a numbers game. That’s really the essence of longtermism. KH : We are going to dive more deeply into the implications of this longtermist idea, that we need to focus on and prioritize outcomes in the deep future, but first, we are going to talk a bit about the TESCREAL bundle of ideologies. TESCREAL is an acronym that can help us understand how longtermism connects with some of the other ideologies and concepts that are driving the new space race, as well as the race to create artificial general intelligence. It’s important to note that the concept of artificial general intelligence, or AGI, bears no relation to the products and programs that are currently being described as AI in the world today. In fact, Emily Tucker, the Executive Director of the Center on Privacy & Technology, has argued that programs like ChatGPT, should not be characterized as artificial intelligence at all. Tucker writes that our public adoption of AI, as a means to describe current technologies, is the product of “marketing campaigns, and market control,” and of tech companies pushing products with a “turbocharged” capacity for extraction. Using massive data sets, Large Language Models like ChatGPT string together words and information in ways that often make sense, and sometimes don’t. The branding of these products as AI has helped create the illusion that AGI is just around the corner. Artificial general intelligence lacks a standard definition, but it usually refers to an AI system that’s cognitive abilities would either match or exceed those of human beings. An artificial superintelligence would be a system that profoundly exceeds human capacities. As we will discuss in our next episode, we are about as close to developing those forms of AI as we are to colonizing Mars — which is to say, Elon Musk’s claims that we will colonize Mars by the 2050s are complete science fiction. Having said that, let’s get into what we mean when we use the acronym TESCREAL, and why it matters. ET : The acronym TESCREAL was coined by myself while writing an article with Dr. Timnit Gebru, who’s this world-renowned computer scientist who used to work for Google, and then was fired after sounding the alarm about algorithmic bias. We were trying to understand why it is that artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has become the explicit aim of companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, that are backed by billions of dollars in huge corporations. DeepMind is owned by Google. OpenAI gets lot of its funding from Microsoft, I think $11 billion so far. Why is it that they are so obsessed with AGI? I think part of the explanation is the obvious, which is that Microsoft and Google believe that AGI is going to yield huge profits. There’s just going to be billions of dollars in profits as a result of creating these increasingly so-called powerful artificial intelligence systems. I think that explanation is incomplete. One really has to recognize the influence of this TESCREAL bundle of ideologies. The acronym stands for Transhumanism, Extropianism — it’s a mouthful — Singularitarianism, Cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, and longtermism. The way I’ve described it is that transhumanism is the backbone of the bundle, and longtermism is kind of the galaxy brain atop the bundle. It sort of binds together a lot of the themes and important ideas that are central to these other ideologies. Transhumanism in its modern form emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s. The central aim of transhumanism is to develop advanced technologies that would enable us to radically modify, or they would say radically enhance, ourselves to ultimately become a posthuman species. So by becoming posthuman, we could end up living forever. We could maybe abolish all suffering, radically enhance our cognitive systems, augment our cognitive systems so that we ourselves become super intelligent, and ultimately usher in this kind of utopian world of immortality and endless pleasure. Some transhumanists even refer to this as paradise engineering. In fact, the parallels between transhumanism and traditional religion are really quite striking. That’s really not a coincidence. If you look at the individuals who initially developed the transhumanist ideology, they were explicit that this is supposed to be a replacement for traditional religion. It’s a secular replacement. And so, AGI was always pretty central to this vision. Once we create AGI, if it is controllable, so if it behaves in a way that aligns with our intentions, then we could instruct it to solve all of the world’s problems. We could just delegate it the task of curing the so-called problem of aging. Maybe it takes a minute to think about it. After that minute, because it’s super intelligent, it comes up with a solution. Same goes for the problem of scarcity. It would potentially be able to immediately introduce this new world of radical abundance. So AGI is sort of the most direct route from where we are today to this techno-utopian world in the future that we could potentially create. Sam Altman himself, the CEO of OpenAI, has said that without AGI, space colonization is probably impossible. Maybe we could make it to Mars, but getting to the next solar system, which is much, much, much further than Mars, that’s going to be really difficult. So we probably need AGI for that. That’s, from the start, when the bundle really just consisted of transhumanism, AGI was very important. It was already very central to this worldview. Then over time, transhumanism took on a number of different forms. There was extropianism, it was the first organized transhumanist movement. Then you had singularitarianism, which emphasized the so-called technological singularity. It’s this future moment when the pace of scientific and technological development accelerates to the point where we just simply cannot comprehend the rapidity of new innovations. Perhaps that could be triggered by the creation of AGI. Since AGI is by definition, at least as smart as humans, and since the task of designing increasingly powerful AI systems is an intellectual task, if we have this system that just has our level of “intelligence,” then it could take over that task of designing better and better machines. You’d get this, what they would call recursive self-improvement, a positive feedback loop, whereby the more capable the AI system becomes, the better positioned it is to create even more capable AI systems, and so on and so on. That’s another notion of the singularity. So for the singularitarianism version of transhumanism, AGI really is just right there, center stage. Then you have cosmism, which is another variant of transhumanism, which is just even broader and even grander, you might even say even more grandiose, than transhumanism. Because it’s about spreading into space, reengineering galaxies engaging in things that they call like spacetime engineering. The creation of scientific magic is another term that they use. This particular view of the future has become really central to longtermism. So to get to the other letters in the acronym real fast, rationalism is basically a spinoff of the transhumanist movement. That is based on this idea that, okay, we’re going to create this techno-utopian future in the world, that’s going to require a lot of “smart people doing very smart things.” So let’s take a step back and try to figure out the best ways to optimize our smartness, in other words, to become maximally rational. That’s the heart of rationalism. Then EA is what I had mentioned before, which actually was greatly influenced by rationalism. Whereas rationalists focus on optimizing our rationality, effective altruists focus on optimizing our morality. Again, if you were an EA who’s trying to optimize your morality by increasing the amount of good you do in the world, once you realize that, the future could be huge. We could colonize space, create these vast computer simulations, in which trillions and trillions of digital people supposedly live happy lives, then it’s only rational to focus on the very far future rather than on the present. That’s the TESCREAL bundle in a nutshell. Again, transhumanism is the backbone. Longtermism is the galaxy brain that sits atop the bundle, and it’s this bundle of ideologies that has become hugely influential in Silicon Valley, the tech world more generally. Elon Musk calls longtermism, “A close match for my philosophy.” Sam Altman is a transhumanist whose vision of the future aligns very closely with cosmism and longtermism. According to a New York Times profile of Sam Altman, he’s also a product of the effective altruist and rationalist communities. So this ideology is everywhere. It’s even infiltrating major international governing bodies like the United Nations. There was a UN Dispatch article from just last year that noted that foreign policy circles in general and the United Nations in particular are increasingly embracing the longtermism ideology. If you embrace longtermism, there is a sense in which you embrace the core commitments of many of the other TESCREAL ideologies. It’s really, really important for people to understand what this bundle of ideologies is, because it’s become so hugely influential, and is shaping our world right now, and will continue to shape it for the foreseeable future. KH : Something that I was eager to discuss with Émile was how they became interested in longtermism and the larger bundle of TESCREAL ideologies. In following Émile’s work, I learned that they once subscribed to transhumanist ideas. I wanted to understand how and why they were pulled into that ideology, because, if we are going to counter these ideas in the world, we need to understand how and why they appeal to people who aren’t tech bros trying to take over the world. ET: My background with this bundle of ideologies is that I discovered transhumanism, I think around 2005, as a result of Ray Kurzweil’s book, which was published in 2005, called The Singularity is Near . And to be honest, my initial reaction to transhumanism was horror, in part because the very same individuals who were promoting the development of these advanced technologies, like synthetic biology, and molecular nanotechnology, advanced artificial superintelligence, and so on, also acknowledged that these technologies would introduce unprecedented threats to human survival. So on the TESCREAL view, failing to create these technologies means we never get to utopia. We have no option except to develop them. There’s only one way forward, and it’s by way of creating these technologies, but they’re going to introduce extraordinary hazards to every human being on earth. Consequently, what we need to do is create this field, which is called existential risk studies, to study these risks, figure out how to neutralize them. That way, we can have our technological cake and eat it too. So my initial thought was that the safer option would be just to not develop these technologies in the first place. Ray Kurzweil himself says that we have probably a better than 50 percent chance of surviving the 21st century. Those odds are dismal. That’s alarming. He’s a techno-optimist, widely known as a techno-optimist. He says, “Okay, we have probably a better than 50 percent chance of not all dying.” I thought it’s just better to never develop these. In fact, this was a view that was proposed and defended by a guy named Bill Joy in 2000, in a famous 2000 article published in Wired Magazine, called Why the Future Doesn’t Need Us . Bill Joy was the co-founder of Sun Microsystems. He’s not a Luddite, he’s not anti-technology, but he had basically the same response that I had, these technologies are just way too dangerous. Transhumanists and the early TESCREALists said, “No, no, no, standing still is not an option. We have to develop them because they’re our vehicle to tech-utopia in the far future, or maybe the very near future.” And so, over time, I became convinced that the enterprise of technology probably can’t be stopped. There probably are no breaks on this train that we all find ourselves sitting on. So consequently, the best thing to do is to join them, and to try to do what one can to change the trajectory of civilizational development into the future, in ways that are as good as possible. So that’s how I ended up in the transhumanist movement. And I would say that over time, for probably about six years, I came to not just reluctantly join this movement, but actually to become enthusiastic about it. I think part of that is that I was raised in a really religious community. There was a lot of talk about the future of humanity, in particular, like end times events like the rapture, and like the rise of the antichrist, and this seven-year period of just absolute terrors called the tribulation, during which the antichrist reigns. Then ultimately, Jesus descends. That’s the second coming. There’s the battle of Armageddon, and it’s all just dark and bleak. But once the clouds clear, then there was paradise with God forever. So I mention this because I started to lose my faith when I was really around 19 or 20. What was left behind was a religion shaped hole, and transhumanism fit that very nicely. I mentioned before that the individuals who developed the idea of transhumanism in the first place all were explicit that it is a secular replacement for traditional religion. For example, one of the first times that this idea of transhumanism was developed was in a 1927 book by Julian Huxley, very prominent eugenicist from the 20th century. The book was revealingly called, Religion Without Revelation . So instead of relying on supernatural agency to usher in paradise forever, and immortality, and radical abundance, and so on, let’s try to figure out how to do this on our own. And by using technology, by employing the tools of science and eugenics, and through increasingly sophisticated innovations, we can devise means ourselves to create heaven on earth, and maybe even heaven in the heavens if we spread beyond earth, which we should. So transhumanism really fit, by intention, this void that was left behind when I lost my faith in Christianity. And so the more I found myself in the transhumanist community, the more convinced I was that actually, maybe it’s possible to develop these technologies and usher in utopia by ourselves, to use radical life extension technologies to enable us to live indefinitely long lives, use these technologies like brain computer interfaces to connect our brains to the internet, thereby making us much more intelligent than we currently are, and so on. It just seems like maybe actually this is technologically feasible. That’s what led me to focus on studying existential risk. Again, existential risk is any event that would prevent us from creating this techno-utopian world in the future. And so if we mitigate those threats, then we are simultaneously increasing the likelihood that we will live in this utopian world. Really, what changed my mind about all of this, there were two things. One is very embarrassing, and it’s that I actually started to read scholars who aren’t white men. I got a completely different perspective over several years, sort of diving into this non-white male literature, on what the future could look like. That was a bit of an epiphany for me, that actually, the vision of utopia that is at the heart of the TESCREAL bundle, is deeply impoverished. I think, I now believe, that its realization would be catastrophic for most of humanity. If you look in the TESCREAL literature, you will find virtually zero reference to ideas about what the future ought to look like from non-Western perspectives, such as Indigenous, Muslim, Afro-futurism, feminist, disability rights, queerness, and so on, these perspectives. There’s just no reference to what the future might look like from these alternative vantage points. Consequently, you just end up with this very homogenized, like I said, just deeply impoverished view of what the future should be. We just need to go out into space, create these vast computer simulations, where there are just trillions and trillions of digital people who are all, for some reason, living these happy lives, being productive, maximizing economic productivity. In the process, we subjugate nature. We plunder the cosmos for all of its resources. This is what longtermisms call our cosmic endowment of negentropy, which is just negative entropy. It’s just energy that is usable to us, in order to create value structures like human beings. That’s literally how longtermists refer to future people, just value structures. And so, I thought that okay, it’s really impoverished. Then so increasingly, this utopian vision became kind of a non-starter for me. A lot of people can agree on what dystopia would look like, but few people can agree about what utopia should be. And I really think if the vision of utopia at the heart of the TESCREAL bundle were laid out in all its details to the majority of humanity, they’d say, “That is not a future I want.” Beyond that, though, I also became convinced that longtermism, and TESCREALism more generally, could be super dangerous. And this is because I started to study the history of utopian movements that became violent. And I noticed that at the core of a lot of these movements were two components, a utopian vision of the future, and also a broadly utilitarian mode of moral reasoning. So this is a kind of reasoning according to which the ends justify the means, or at least the ends can justify the means. And when the ends are literal utopia, what is off the table for ensuring that we reach that utopia? In the past, these two components, when smashed together, have led to all sorts of violent acts, even genocides. I mean, World War II, Hitler promised the German people a thousand-year Reich. He was very much drawing from the Christian tradition of utopia. This thousand year Reich is a period when Germany’s going to reign supreme and everything for the Aryan people is going to be marvelous. That’s partly what justified, at least for true believers in this particular vision of the future, it justified extreme actions, even genocidal actions. At the heart of longtermism are just these two components. It became increasingly clear to me that longtermism itself could be profoundly dangerous. If there are true believers out there who really do expect there to be this utopian future among the heavens, full of astronomical amounts of value, 10 to the 58 happy digital people, then it’s not difficult to imagine them in a situation where they justify to themselves the use of extreme force, maybe even violence, maybe even something genocidal, in order to achieve those ends. When I initially wrote about this concern, it was 2021, published in Eon, and the concern was merely hypothetical. My claim was not that there are actual longtermists out there who are saying that engaging in violence and so on is in fact justified, but rather that this ideology itself is dangerous. And if you fast-forward two years into the future up to the present, these hypothetical concerns that I expressed are now really quite concrete. For example, Eliezer Yudkowsky, the founder of rationalism, former extropian transhumanist singularitarian, who also is greatly influential among effective altruists and longtermists, he believes that if we create artificial general intelligence in the near future, it will kill everybody. So as a result, this techno-utopian future will be erased forever. He also believes that an all-out thermonuclear war would not kill everybody on the planet. In fact, the best science today supports that. An all-out thermonuclear war probably would not kill everybody. There was a paper published in 2020 that found that an exchange between Russia and the US would kill about 5 billion people. That’s just an enormous catastrophe, but it leaves behind about a reassuring 3 billion to carry on civilization, and ultimately develop this posthuman future by colonizing space, subjugating nature, plundering the cosmos, and so on. Yudkowsky, looking at these two possibilities, argues that we should do everything we can to prevent AGI from being developed in the near future because we’re just not ready for it yet. We should even risk an all-out thermonuclear war, because again, a thermonuclear war probably is not going to kill everybody, whereas AGI in the foreseeable future is going to. When he was asked on Twitter “How many people are allowed to die to prevent AGI in the near future,” his response was, “So long as there are enough people, maybe this is just a few thousand, maybe it’s 10,000 or so. As long as there are enough people to survive the nuclear holocaust and then rebuild civilization, then maybe we can still make it to the stars someday.” That was his response. It’s exactly that kind of reasoning that I was screaming about two years ago. It’s really dangerous. Here you see people in that community, expressing the very same extremist views. KH : I started hearing about longtermism last year, around the time that Elon Musk launched his bid to acquire Twitter. Some of you may recall Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter, justifying Musk’s takeover of the platform by saying, “Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.” That bit about extending “the light of consciousness” piqued my interest. I assumed Dorsey was referring to Musk’s space fetish, but I couldn’t figure out what that had to do with allowing a man with terrible politics, and a history of bullshitting on a grand scale, to take over one of the most important social media platforms in the world. We are talking about a man who recently tweeted that he wants to have “ a literal dick-measuring contest ” with Mark Zuckerberg. So any investment in his larger vision is just baffling to me. Well, an investigative journalist named Dave Troy broke things down in a blog post on Medium, in which he explained that Dorsey and Musk both subscribe to longtermist ideas, and that Musk’s takeover of Twitter was not so much a business venture, but an ideological maneuver. According to Troy, Musk was angling to disempower so-called “woke” people and ideas that he claims are “destroying civilization,” for the sake of his larger political agenda. So why does Musk view people and movements emphasizing the well-being of marginalized people, or the environment, in the here and now, as threats to civilization? The longtermist philosophy dictates that the only threats that matter are existential threats, which could interfere with the realization of the utopian, interplanetary future longtermists envision. The only goals that matter are the advancement of AI and the new space race. Because those two pursuits will supposedly allow us to maximize the number of happy, future people, including vast numbers of digital people, to such a degree that our concern for those enormous future communities should outweigh any concern we have for people who are suffering or being treated unfairly today. As Émile explains, it’s a numbers game. ET : Everybody counts for one, but there could be 10 to the 58 digital people in the future, whereas there are only 8 billion of us right now. So by virtue of the multitude of potential future people, they deserve our moral attention more than contemporary people. That’s really the key idea. And the reason many TESCREALists, Longtermists in particular, are obsessed with our future being digital is that, you can cram more digital people per unit of space than you can biological people. That’s one reason. If you want to maximize the total amount of value in the universe, that’s going to require increasing the total human population. The more happy people there are, the more value there’s going to be in total within the universe as a whole. You have a moral obligation to increase the human population. If it’s the case that you can create more digital people in the future than biological people, then you should create those digital people. That’s one reason they’re obsessed with this particular view. Also, if we want to colonize space in the first place, we’re almost certainly going to need to become digital. Like I mentioned before, spreading to Mars, that may be possible if we’re biological, but getting to the next solar system, much less the next galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy, that is going to take an enormous amount of time, and the conditions of outer space are extremely hostile. Biological tissue is just not very conducive to these sorts of multi-million year trips to other solar systems or other galaxies. We really need to become digital. This notion that the future is digital is, I think, just really central to the longtermist, and more generally, the TESCREAList worldview. Maybe it’s just worth noting that longtermism sounds really good. There’s something very refreshing about the word itself, because there is a huge amount of short termism in our society. In fact, it’s baked into our institutions. There are quarterly reports that discourage thinking about the very long term. Our election cycles are four or six years, and consequently, politicians are not going to be campaigning on promoting policies that consider the welfare of people hundreds, or thousands, or even more years into the future. So short termism is pervasive. Myopia is the standard perspective on the future. In fact, there was a study out from probably about a decade ago, in which a scholar named Bruce Kahn surveyed people about their ability to foresee the future. He found that our vision of what is to come tends not to extend further than 10 years or so. That’s sort of the horizon that most people find to be comprehensible. Beyond that, it’s just too abstract to think clearly about. So any shift towards thinking about the longer term future of humanity seems, at least at first glance, to be very attractive. After all, the catastrophic effects of climate change will persist for another 10,000 years or so. That’s a much longer time than civilization has so far existed. Civilization’s maybe 6,000 years or so. 10,000 years, what we’re doing right now and what we’ve done since the Industrial Revolution, that will shape the livability of our planet for many millennia. Surely one would want a kind of long term, you might say longtermist, perspective on these things. The longtermist ideology goes so far beyond long-term thinking. There are ideological commitments to longtermism that, I think, most people, probably the large majority of people who care about long-term thinking, would find very off-putting. One is what I had gestured at a moment ago, that is there’s a moral imperative to increase the human population. So long as people are on average happy, they will bring value into the universe. On even a moderate interpretation of longtermism, we have a moral obligation to increase the amount of value in the universe as a whole. That means bigger is better. To quote William MacAskill in his book from last year called What We Owe The Future , “bigger is better.” He even writes that on this account, there is a moral case for space settlement. If bigger is better, and if the surface of earth is finite, which it is, then we need to spread beyond earth. That’s the reason he concludes that there’s a moral case for space settlement. That is a very radical idea. Once again, if you can create a bigger population by creating digital people, by replacing the biological substrate with some kind of digital hardware, then we should do that. Ultimately, that is how we fulfill our long-term potential in the universe. That’s one sense in which these ideologies are counterintuitive and quite radical. Another, rationalism, also might seem to have a certain appeal because surely, we want to be as individuals more rational. Actually, if you look at the understanding of rationality that is most popular within the rationalist community, it leads to all sorts of very strange conclusions. Here’s one example, Eliezer Yudkowsky, who more or less founded the rationalist community, and is a transhumanist singularitarian, who participated in the extropian movement. His views these days are very closely aligned to effective altruism and longtermism. He has a foot in just about all of these ideologies within the TESCREAL bundle. He has suggested that morality should be much more about number crunching than a lot of us would naturally suspect. For example, he published a blog post on a website called LessWrong, which he founded in 2009. That’s sort of the online epicenter of the rationalist community. In this blog post, he asked a question, what would be worse: one individual being tortured mercilessly for 50 years straight? Just endless interminable suffering for this one individual, or some extremely large number of individuals who have the almost imperceptible discomfort of having an eyelash in their eye? Which of these would be worse? Well, if you crunch the numbers, and if the number of individuals who experience this eyelash in their eye is large enough, then you should choose to have the individual being tortured for 50 years, rather than this huge number of individuals being slightly bothered by just a very small amount of discomfort in their eye. It’s just a numbers game. And so he refers to this as the heuristic of shut up and multiply. Over time, he’s gotten a little less dogmatic about it. He suggested that maybe there are situations in which shut up and multiply doesn’t always hold. This sort of gives you a sense of how extreme this approach to trying to optimize our rationality can be. Some of the conclusions of this community have been really quite radical and problematic. Another example is there have been a number of individuals in the rationalist community who have also been quite sympathetic with eugenics. So if we want to realize this tech-utopian future, then we’re going to need some number of sufficiently “intelligent” individuals in society. Consequently, if the number of people who have lower “intelligence” outbreed their more intellectually capable peers, then the average intelligence of humanity is going to fall. This is what they argue. This is a scenario called dysgenics. That is a term that goes back to the early 20th century eugenicists, many of whom were motivated or inspired by certain racist, ableist, classist, sexist, and otherwise elitist views. Those views are still all over the place in the rationalist community. I think even more, this notion of eugenics and the anxiety surrounding the possibility of dysgenics pressures is still pretty pervasive. Another example would be from Nick Bostrom’s paper published in 2002, in which he introduces the notion of existential risk. Existential risk is any event that would prevent us from realizing this techno-utopian posthuman future among the stars full of astronomical amounts of value. He lists a number of existential risk scenarios. Some of them are really quite obvious, like a thermonuclear war. Maybe if the U.S. and Russia and India, Pakistan, all the other nuclear nations were to be involved in it, all out thermonuclear exchange, then the outcome could potentially be human extinction. But there are also various survivable scenarios that could preclude the realization of this tech-utopian world in the future. He explicitly identifies one of them as dysgenic pressures. Again, where less so-called intelligent people outbreed their more intelligent peers. Consequently, humanity becomes insufficiently smart to develop the technologies needed to get us to utopia. Perhaps that might include artificial general intelligence. And as a result, this utopia is never realized, and that would be an existential catastrophe. This is just a sense of how radical and extreme some of the views are in this community. KH : The idea of human value, and maximizing that value, is a prominent concept in longtermist ideology. In a 2003 paper called Astronomical Waste — a document that is foundational to longtermism — Nick Bostrom forwarded the idea that any delay in space colonization is fundamentally harmful, because such delays would reduce the number of potential future, happy humans in the distant future. Bostrom wrote that “the potential for one hundred trillion potential human beings is lost for every second of postponement of colonization of our supercluster.” Last year, Elon Musk retweeted a post that called Astronomical Waste “Likely the most important paper ever written.” This understanding of human value as a numbers game, the expansion of which is dependent on space colonization, allows longtermists to dismiss many social concerns. I think many of us would take issue with the idea that because something has value, our priority should be the mass production and mass proliferation of that thing, but how does one even define human value? This was one of the topics I found most confusing, as I dug into longtermist ideas. ET : What is the value that they’re referring to when they talk about maximizing value? It depends on who you ask. Some would say that what we need to do as a species right now is first and foremost, address the problem of mitigating existential risk. Once we do that, we end up in a state of existential security. That gives us some breathing room. We figure out how to eliminate the threat of thermonuclear war, to develop nanotechnology, or different kinds of synthetic biology in a way that is not going to threaten our continued survival. Once we have obtained existential security, then there is this epoch, this period that they call the long reflection. This could be centuries or millennia. When we all get together, all humans around the world, and we just focus on trying to solve some of the perennial problems in philosophy: what do we value? What should we value? What is this thing that we should try to maximize in the future? Is it happiness? One of the main theories of value within philosophy is called hedonism. This states that the only intrinsically valuable thing in the whole universe is happiness or pleasure. There are other theories that say no, it’s actually something like satisfying desires or there are yet still other theories that would say it’s things like knowledge, and friendship, and science, and the arts, in addition to happiness. How exactly we understand value is a bit orthogonal to the longtermist argument, because what they will say is that the future could be huge. If we colonize space and we create all of these digital people, the future could be enormous. That means that whatever it is you value, there could be a whole lot more of it in the future. So the real key idea is this notion of value maximization. You could ask the question, “What is the appropriate response to intrinsic value?” Whatever it is that has intrinsic value, what’s the right way to respond to that? The longtermists would say, “Maximize it.” If you value walks on the beach, then two walks on the beach is going to be twice as good as one. If you value great works of art, then 100 great works of art is going to be twice as good as just 50 great works of art. Whatever it is you value, there should be more of it. This idea that value should be maximized historically arose pretty much around the same time as capitalism. It’s associated with a particular ethical theory called utilitarianism. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that utilitarianism and capitalism arose at the same time. Because utilitarianism is really a very quantitative way of thinking about morality. The fundamental precept is that value should be maximized. Consequently, there are all sorts of parallels between it and capitalism. You could think of utilitarianism as kind of a branch of economics, whereas capitalists are all about maximizing the bottom line, which is profit, utilitarians take the bottom line that should be maximized to be just value in a more general and impersonal sense. That’s really the key idea. It’s worth noting that there are other answers to the question, “What is the appropriate response to value?” You could say, “Well actually, what you should do is when presented with something that is intrinsically valuable, you should treasure it or cherish it, love it, protect it, preserve it, sustain it.” There’s any number of possible answers here that don’t involve just increasing the total number of instances of that thing in the universe. I think if you ask a lot of longtermists, they’ll say that we should probably embrace some kind of pluralistic view of value. We don’t really know what value is. It probably includes happiness. The more instances of happiness there are in the future, the better the universe becomes as a whole. But ultimately, this is something we can decide during the long reflection. By the way, this notion of the long reflection I find to be a complete non-starter. When you think about all people around the world just sort of hitting pause on everything, sitting around, joining hands for a couple centuries or millennia to solve these perennial philosophical problems, to figure out what value is, that seems just absolutely entirely implausible. Nonetheless, this is part of the longtermist blueprint for the future. So yeah, the key idea is that whatever it is we value, there just needs to be more of it. KH : The idea of massive numbers of future happy people, digital and non-digital, as a maximization of human value, is one that I have heard a lot, from people whose worldviews fall within the TESCREAL bundle, and it’s a concept I find quite laughable. Because if I were to ask all of you listening or reading right now, “What is happiness,” I would get a lot of wildly different answers. I can’t even answer the question, “What is happiness?” Is it how I felt on my wedding day? Is it how I feel when I eat an edible, or see a Nazi get punched? Happiness is not a concrete concept that can be measured, so how can it be a defining feature of longtermism’s notion of human value, and how can it be effectively maximized? ET : I think one thing that’s completely missing from the longtermist, or I’d say the TESCREAL literature more generally, is any kind of philosophically serious analysis of the meaning of life. What makes life meaningful? The focus is really just maximizing value in the universe as a whole, but you could potentially maximize value while rendering lives meaningless. For me, understanding what makes a life meaningful is just much more important than maximizing happiness. Also, I think you’re totally right that this sort of quantitative notion of happiness is really bizarre. Utilitarians have this term for a unit of happiness. It’s called a util, and that comes from the word utility. Utility is more or less interchangeable with value. You want to maximize value, that means you want to maximize utility. Consequently, the more utils there are in the universe, the better the universe becomes. What exactly a util is, I have no idea. I have no idea how many utils I introduced into the universe yesterday. I don’t know if I’ve created more utils today than a week ago. It’s all just very strange, and it’s trying to understand this extraordinarily complex and rich domain, which is morality, in a kind of quantitative, procrustean way. I think when a lot of people understand that this is the kind of philosophical foundations of a large part of the TESCREAL worldview, they will immediately recoil. KH : The concept of the util has me wondering how many utils I introduce by eating an edible, but we won’t dwell on that. Anyway, the TESCREAL bundle is a relatively new concept. I personally find the acronym quite useful, when exploring these ideas. But Émile and Timnit Gebru have received some fierce criticism for their ideas. In June, PhD student Eli Sennesh and James J. Hughes, who is the Executive Director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, published a Medium post called Conspiracy Theories, Left Futurism, and the Attack on TESCREAL , which levels some harsh critiques of Émile and Timnit Gebru’s work, including the idea that the ideologies in the TESCREAL acronym can be bundled together at all. I had a lot of issues with this piece, which we don’t have time to dive into today, but I wanted to give Émile a chance to respond to some of the piece’s criticisms of their work and ideas. ET : James Hughes and another individual published this Medium article, in which they argued that the TESCREAL bundle is essentially a conspiracy theory. I do not find their arguments to be very compelling at all. In fact, I can’t even recall what the central thrust of their argument is exactly. It’s this notion that TESCREALism is, this is just conspiratorial thinking, is completely untenable. It’s not a conspiracy theory if there’s a huge amount of evidence supporting it. There is an enormous amount of evidence that corroborates this notion that there is this bundle of ideologies that really do belong together. They do. They constitute a kind of single entity or single organism, extending from the late 1980s up to the present, and that this bundle is very influential within Silicon Valley. One thing I should point out is these movements and these ideologies, they share a whole lot of the same ideological real estate. Historically, they emerged one out of the other. You could think about this as a suburban sprawl. It started with transhumanism. Extropianism was the first organized transhumanist movement. Many extropians then went on to participate in singularitarianism. The founder of modern cosmism himself was an extropian transhumanist. Then Nick Bostrom is more or less the founder of longtermism, he was hugely influential among rationalists and EAs, and he also was one of the original transhumanists, a participant in the extropian movement. These ideologies and the movements are overlapping and interconnected in all sorts of ways. In fact, one of the individuals who retweeted the criticism, the article critiquing the TESCREAL concept by James Hughes, was an individual named Anders Sandberg. He was, as far as I can tell, endorsing this objection that TESCREALism is just a conspiracy theory. I found this to be quite amusing, because Anders Sandberg is a transhumanist who participated in the extropian movement, who’s written about the singularity, and in fact hopes that the singularity will come about. He’s a singularitarian, essentially. He’s had been very closely associated with the founder of cosmism, Ben Goertzel. He participates in the rationalist community, hugely influential among the EAs, effective altruists, and is a longtermist. He’s an example. He exemplifies all of these different ideologies, maybe with the exception of cosmism, at least not explicitly. Although, again, the central idea, the vision of cosmism is very much alive within longtermism. So there’s an individual who is basically at the very heart of the TESCREAL movement, who’s retweeting this claim that TESCREALism is just a conspiracy theory. So I feel like this gestures at the extent to which someone should take this criticism of the term and concept that Timnit Gebru and I came up with, should look at these criticisms with a bit of a chuckle. KH : The article also argues that some of these ideologies have progressive wings or progressive under-pinnings, and that we disregard or wrong those progressive adherents, who could be our allies, when we engage in some of the generalizations that they claim are inherent in the bundling of TESCREAL. This is a terrible argument, on its face. Because there have always been oppressive and reactionary ideas that have spread on both the left and right, even if they were concentrated on the right, and that remains true today. Transphobic ideas are a prime example, in our time, as those ideas are primarily pushed by the right, but can also be found among liberals and people who identify as leftists. ET : It’s also worth noting that eugenics, throughout the 20th century, we associate it with the fascists, with Nazi Germany. It was hugely popular among progressives as well as fascists, the whole political spectrum. There were individuals along the entire political spectrum who were all gung ho about eugenics. Just because something is progressive doesn’t mean that it’s not problematic. Also, I would say that the genuinely progressive wings of the transhumanist movement, of the extropians, well the extropian movement is an exception because that’s very libertarian, but the progressive wings of the transhumanist movement, they’re just not nearly as influential. And so, this notion of the TESCREAL bundle absolutely makes room for all sorts of nuances. I’m not saying that all transhumanists are TESCREALists. I’m not saying that all EAs are TESCREALists. There are plenty of EAs who think longtermism is nuts, and want nothing to do with longtermism. They just want to focus on eliminating factory farming and alleviating global poverty. EA, there’s a growing and very powerful part of EA, which is longtermist. This idea of the TESCREAL bundle absolutely makes plenty of room for a variation within the communities corresponding to each letter in the acronym. So that was another reason I found the article to kind of miss the target, because my and Gebru’s claim is not that every transhumanist and every singularitarian is a TESCREAList. It’s just that the most powerful figures within these communities are TESCREALists. I think that’s really the key idea. KH : You may be hearing all of this and thinking, “Well, I don’t have any sway in Silicon Valley, so what the hell am I supposed to do about all of this?” If you’re feeling that way, I want you to stop and think about how most people would feel about longtermism, as a concept, if they had any notion of what we’ve discussed here today. Simply shining a light on these ideas is an important start. We have to know our enemies, and not enough people know or understand what we are up against when it comes to longtermism or TESCREAL. ET : I think it’s really important for people to understand what this ideology is, how influential it is, and why it could potentially be dangerous. This is what I’ve been writing about, one of the things I’ve been writing about, at least for the past year, and hoping to just alert the public that there’s this bundle of ideologies out there and behind the scenes, it has become massively influential. It’s infiltrating the UN, it’s pervasive in Silicon Valley. I think for all of the talk among TESCREALists of existential risks, including risks arising from artificial general intelligence, I think there is a really good argument to make that one of the most significant threats facing us is the TESCREAL bundle itself. After all, you have hugely influential people in this TESCREAL community, like Eliezer Yudkowsky, who’s writing in major publications like Time Magazine, that we should risk thermonuclear war to prevent the AGI apocalypse. We should utilize military force to strike data centers that could be used by nations to create an artificial general intelligence. This is really incredibly dangerous stuff, and it’s exactly what I was worried about several years ago. And to my horror, we’re now in a situation where my fear that extreme violence might end up being viewed as justified in order to prevent an existential catastrophe. My worries have been validated. And I think that’s a really scary thing. KH : Émile also has an upcoming book that will be released in July which I’m really excited about. ET : So the upcoming book is called Human Extinction, A History of the Science and Ethics of Annihilation , and it basically traces the history of thinking about human extinction throughout the western tradition, from the ancient Greeks, all the way up to the present. Then it also provides really the first comprehensive analysis of the ethics of human extinction. And so this is out July 14th. You could find it on Amazon or the website of the publisher , which is Routledge. It’s a bit pricey, but hopefully if you do buy it, it’ll be worth the money. KH : I got so much out of this conversation, and I hope our readers and listeners have as well. For me, the bottom line is that, in longtermism, we have an ideology where suffering, mass death, and even extreme acts of violence, can all be deemed acceptable, if these actions support the project of extending the light of consciousness, through space colonization and the development of AGI. It’s important to understand just how disposable you and I, and everyone suffering under white supremacy, imperialism and capitalism are according to this ideology. And while longtermism may be relatively new to many of us, the truth is, its adherents have been working for years to infiltrate educational institutions, policy-making organizations, and government structures, so we are talking about a social and political project that is well underway. As people who would oppose this work, we have a lot of catching up to do. I also think Émile’s point about transhumanism filling a religion-sized hole in their life, at one time, is also a really important thought for activists to consider, because a whole lot of people are walking around with a religion-sized hole in their worldview. We are living through uncertain, catastrophic times, and as Mike Davis described in Planet of Slums , people can become more vulnerable to cults and hyper religious movements during times of collapse. We are social animals, and as such, we are always searching for leadership — for someone who is bigger, stronger, and faster, who has a plan. Some people find those comforts within the realm of faith, but many of us are not religious, and many more do not subscribe to literal interpretations of their faiths, and are therefore still searching for scientific and philosophical answers. People are extremely vulnerable, in these times, and if we, as organizers and activists, do not attempt to fill the religion-sized hole in people’s lives with meaningful pursuits and ideas, destructive and dehumanizing ideas will fill that empty space. We have to welcome people into movements that address their existential, epistemic and relational needs, so that they are less likely to fall victim to cultish ideas and ideologies. I realize that’s easier said than done, but we are going to talk a bit about what kind of stories and ideas will be helpful to us, in countering the religiosity of the new space race and the race for AGI in upcoming episodes. For now, I would just like to remind us of Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s words, which are forever in my heart: “where life is precious, life is precious.” That means that here and now, life is precious if we, as human beings, are precious to each other. That is a decision that we make, every day, and I consider it a political commitment. We do not need to maximize ourselves, by having as many children as possible, or creating infinite hordes of digital people, as the pronatalists and AI obsessed tech bros insist. We need to cherish one another, and all of the beings and stuff that makes our existence possible. That’s what it means to fight for each other, and for the future. Whatever human value might be, its preservation will not be realized in some sci-fi fantasyland, spread across the galaxy. The fight for everything that is worth preserving about who and what we are is happening here and now, as we combat inequality, extraction, militarism, and every other driver of climate chaos and dehumanization in our times. We are that fight, if we cherish each other enough to act. I want to thank Émile P. Torres for joining me today. I learned so much, and I am so grateful for this conversation. Don’t forget to check out Émile’s upcoming book Human Extinction, A History of the Science and Ethics of Annihilation. And do be sure to join us for our next couple of episodes, in which we will discuss artificial intelligence and the kind of storytelling we’ll need to wage the ideological battles ahead of us. I also want to thank our listeners for joining us today. And remember, our best defense against cynicism is to do good, and to remember that the good we do matters. Until next time, I’ll see you in the streets. Show Notes Referenced:
Under Elon Musk, the company has laid off over 6,000 people, or about 80 percent of its staff. A new lawsuit filed against Twitter claims that the company has refused to pay out severance payments after it laid off thousands of workers when right-wing billionaire Elon Musk took over. The proposed class action lawsuit, filed on behalf of former employee Courtney McMillian in a federal district court in California on Wednesday, claims that the company has failed to pay at least $500 million to former employees. McMillian, who formerly oversaw Twitter’s employee benefits program in the human resources department, claims that the company in 2019 had created a program that promised employees two months and one week of severance pay for every full year they worked for the company if they were laid off, and six months plus one week for each year for senior employees. Twitter’s 2022 merger agreement , from Musk’s original offer to buy the company, stated that the company would continue this severance agreement for a year after the merger was completed, which happened in October of last year. But the company has failed to do that, reports have found. Some employees were only offered one month of severance pay, months after being laid off. Additionally, according to the lawsuit, many employees didn’t receive severance at all. When asked for comment about the lawsuit, Twitter’s press email sent an automated response containing a poop emoji, as it has done since Musk got rid of the company’s press department earlier this year. Musk has laid off over 6,000 people from Twitter, or about 80 percent of the people who were employed at the company when he took over just nine months ago. He claimed that the people he laid off were extraneous to the company — though, in recent months, the website has been plagued with bugs and outages , while decisions fueled by right-wing hatred , like the removal of its policy against deadnaming trans people, have led users to flee the platform and seek alternatives . The latest lawsuit is just one of many legal and financial issues that have cropped up for the company in recent months. So far, over 1,500 former employees have filed arbitration claims in relation to severance payments; another lawsuit filed last week claimed that the company is refusing to move forward with nearly 900 of these cases by not paying arbitration fees. Other lawsuits related to the layoffs have so far been unsuccessful. The company has continually refused to pay regular bills and rent. In June, a judge allowed a landlord to evict the company from its office in Boulder, Colorado, after failing to pay rent for three months; the company was also sued by the owner of the building that houses Twitter’s headquarters in San Francisco in January after the company allegedly didn’t pay nearly $7 million in rent after Musk took over. Similar reports of nonpayment have come out of the company’s offices in London and New York City. One lawsuit related to yet more alleged missing severance payments filed in May said that Musk once told an investor that he would “only pay rent over his dead body,” the investor said. The company is also reportedly refusing to pay other bills that are crucial to keeping the website running. In June, Platformer reported that the company was refusing to pay bills owed to Google, which helps manage the site’s infrastructure. According to Bloomberg , the company resumed paying the bills shortly after the Platformer report was published.
The 500 richest people on the planet collectively added $852 billion to their fortunes in the first half of 2023. The 500 richest people on the planet collectively added $852 billion to their fortunes in the first half of 2023 due in large part to a record-breaking rally in the U.S. stock market. According to a Bloomberg analysis of its Billionaires Index , the world’s richest people added an average of $14 million per day to their wealth over the past six months, “the best half-year for billionaires since the back half of 2020, when the economy rebounded from a Covid-induced slump.” Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk saw the largest net worth boost of any global billionaire, adding nearly $97 billion in the first half of the year. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, saw his wealth grow by close to $59 billion, the second-largest gain of any billionaire. “They can afford to pay their fair share in taxes,” Americans for Tax Fairness said Wednesday in response to the Bloomberg analysis. In the U.S., capital gains are only taxed when they’ve been realized, such as when stock is sold. That’s how Musk and other mega-billionaires have massive fortunes but small tax bills, as ProPublica detailed last year in its reporting on a trove of IRS documents. “With the exception of one year when he exercised more than a billion dollars in stock options, Musk’s tax bills in no way reflect the fortune he has at his disposal,” the investigative outlet noted. “In 2015, he paid $68,000 in federal income tax. In 2017, it was $65,000, and in 2018 he paid no federal income tax. Between 2014 and 2018, he had a true tax rate of 3.27%.” In his budget proposal for fiscal year 2024, U.S. President Joe Biden called for a tax on the unrealized gains of the ultra-wealthy — an idea previously put forth by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). But the measure is unlikely to get through the Republican-controlled House, which is currently looking to slash taxes for the wealthiest Americans. The already-slim prospects of getting a wealth tax approved in the near future could soon get even worse. Late last month, the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take up a case that “could preempt Congress and the Biden administration from instituting a federal wealth tax,” The Lever reported . “The new case, Moore v. United States , is tailored to try to block Democrats’ promised agenda by defining what can — and cannot — count as taxable ‘income’ under the Constitution. It specifically challenges a one-time levy on some shareholders for their foreign corporate earnings that was included in the 2017 Republican tax law,” The Lever explained. “The real goal of the case is ‘to slam shut the door on a federal wealth tax,’ as the couple’s lawyers wrote in a 2021 column . The couple’s petition to the Supreme Court expressly decries previous wealth tax proposals from Democrats, including Biden, and urges the justices to ‘head off a major constitutional clash down the line.'” Wyden, the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, warned in a statement that “the petitioners in Moore are hoping the Supreme Court will toss out a Ninth Circuit ruling along with potentially decades of settled tax law and bipartisan agreement on congressional authority, all for the benefit of the ultra-wealthy.” “If the Republicans on the Supreme Court take the petitioners’ side, they’d be handing a massive windfall to multinational corporations and could potentially lock in a right for billionaires to opt out of paying anything remotely close to a fair share in taxes,” the senator said. “I designed my approach to taxing billionaires, the centerpiece of which is an accounting method already used in our tax code, with the understanding that special interests would come at it with well-funded legal challenges. I’m totally confident that it’s constitutional.”
Prior to Musk’s takeover, advertisers provided about 90 percent of Twitter’s revenue. Elon Musk, who once vowed to make Twitter the “most respected advertising platform,” has only owned Twitter for a little over half a year. But his time at the helm as owner and CEO has already created a huge crater in the company’s ad sales, new reporting finds, as staff fear that changes like allowing more hate speech to flourish on the platform may be impacting company finances. According to an internal document obtained by The New York Times , the company’s advertising revenue between April and May was 59 percent lower than it was the previous year, at $88 million. The document also showed that the company is falling short of weekly sales projections in the U.S., by as much as 30 percent at times. For this month, the company is forecasting ad sales to be down by 56 percent each week compared to the same time in 2022. Prior to Musk’s takeover, advertisers provided about 90 percent of Twitter’s revenue. Ad sales staff said in interviews with the Times that they fear that dramatic changes to the website made by Musk since he took over in late October have precipitated the drop in revenues, with hate speech playing a seemingly major role. After Musk took ownership, there was an immediate, multiplicative rise in hate speech on the platform. Ever since, the company has made multiple moves to platform neo-Nazis and white supremacists , while also almost explicitly boosting right wing voices on the platform by prioritizing Twitter Blue subscribers in users’ feeds. At the same time, the company has eliminated policies like the one aimed at combating the “targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals” — all while Musk himself has participated in hateful speech against trans people, despite — or perhaps because of — the fact that he has a trans daughter. Experts say that these changes can make advertisers squirm, fearing that their ads will be served next to tweets spewing anti-LGBTQ or racist hatred. Staff say that a rise in pornography on the website and online gambling and marijuana ads may also be contributing to the plunge in revenue. Musk has additionally made a number of business decisions that are potentially turning away clients. He has fired and squeezed out sales executives and laid off over 80 percent of the staff overall, many of whom may have directly worked with clients. Last week, Twitter’s head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, resigned after Musk posted a series of extremist anti-trans tweets. In recent months, Musk has tweeted in support of antisemitic conspiracy theories around George Soros. In May, he lent his support to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who used Twitter to launch DeSantis’s 2024 presidential campaign — an announcement that was riddled with glitches and widely regarded as completely botched. Meanwhile, the platform is now full of other bugs and Musk’s alternative revenue stream, the blue check subscription service Twitter Blue, is barely generating any money for the company. These problems are set to be inherited by the incoming CEO, Linda Yaccarino, who reports have uncovered has reportedly started weeks earlier than expected on Monday, the same day that the Times report was released.
An unmanned SpaceX rocket exploded last month, resulting in catastrophic environmental damage. Newly announced GOP presidential candidate and Florida governor Ron DeSantis (R) signed a bill into state law on Thursday that protects private companies that orchestrate spaceflights from liability lawsuits if a crew member gets injured or dies as a result of an accident. The legislation became law exactly one day after DeSantis announced his 2024 presidential campaign in a Twitter Spaces event hosted by Twitter owner Elon Musk, who also owns the private spaceflight company SpaceX. “Twenty-four hours after appearing with Elon Musk to announce his campaign for president, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis just signed a bill into law that will shield Musk’s SpaceX and other private space companies from negligence lawsuits after an explosion or a crash,” wrote Jason Garcia , an investigative reporter from Florida. The text of the legislation gives tremendous leeway to private spaceflight companies, specifically shielding them from lawsuits relating to “injury to or death of a participant or crew resulting from spaceflight activities” as long as certain warnings were made to crew members prior to launch. Lawsuits could only move forward in certain situations, including cases in which companies had “actual knowledge of an extraordinarily dangerous condition” that is not inherent to space travel before an accident took place. The bill’s signing comes almost exactly a month after a large, unmanned SpaceX rocket exploded over the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, resulting in catastrophic environmental damage , including a fire at a nearby state park . Although the Florida legislature passed the bill prior to DeSantis’s presidential announcement, observers noted that the governor’s signing of the bill a day after Musk helped launch his campaign gave the appearance of a quid pro quo . “What did Elon Musk get for putting the full force of Twitter — broken though it may be — behind Ron DeSantis?” the Twitter account for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) asked . “DeSantis just signed a bill that could potentially shield Musk and SpaceX from being sued for accidents that injure or kill crew members.” The Twitter Spaces event in which DeSantis announced his 2024 campaign was rife with glitches and technical difficulties . At one point, the event required a complete restart, resulting in hundreds of thousands of listeners dropping off before DeSantis even said a word on the broadcast. Observers have noticed a decline in Twitter’s quality in the months since Musk purchased the site, including more frequent outages and difficulties loading media in tweets. Musk’s loosening of restrictions on what content can be shared has also led to a spike in hateful posts from far right users. Anonymous Twitter employees indicated that mismanagement of the social media website was partially responsible for the glitches, telling The New York Times that preparation for the Twitter Spaces event was lacking, and that no planning had been made to account for “site reliability issues” before the launch of the broadcast . “The technical problems on Wednesday showed how Twitter is operating far from seamlessly, turning what was supposed to be a crowning event for Mr. Musk into something of an embarrassment,” Times technology reporter Ryan Mac wrote.
Employees of the social media site said there wasn’t enough preparation for the Twitter Spaces event. On Wednesday night, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) announced his 2024 bid for the GOP nomination for president in a Twitter livestream that was marred by glitches and technical difficulties. The first-of-its-kind event, which was hyped up by both DeSantis and Twitter owner Elon Musk, was widely panned by political and media observers. Musk, along with tech entrepreneur David Sacks, hosted the livestream on Twitter Spaces, a corner of the site where users can host audio-only broadcasts. Musk and Sacks were slated to briefly discuss the presidential race and then introduce DeSantis, but DeSantis didn’t get a chance to speak for nearly the first half hour of the program due to technical difficulties. Sound frequently cut in and out during the first part of the event. The glitches were so bad that Musk and Sacks were forced to stop and restart the event, reportedly dropping the number of listeners in half, from 500,000 when it initially began to 250,000 when it resumed. The drop in listeners meant that hundreds of thousands of users who had intended to hear DeSantis announce his run — an action that typically involves great fanfare — missed the live broadcast. “It was bold. It turned out to be a mistake,” radio host Erick-Woods Erickson said to his followers on Substack . “It is recoverable. But it is a reminder that some things should be under full control of the candidate, particularly the launch day.” Sacks attempted to play off the glitches and delays by claiming they were a result of the event’s popularity. “I think you broke the internet there,” Sacks said when the program started for the second time. “You know you’re breaking new ground when there’s bugs and scaling issues,” he added later on. But observers of the social media site have noted that these glitches are not an anomaly, and that Twitter outages have been more frequent since Musk’s takeover of the site last year . As owner of Twitter, Musk has loosened restrictions on what content can be shared — prompting a flood of hateful posts from far right users — and fired 75 percent of workers at the company. Musk appeared to acknowledge the glitches during the program. “That was insane, sorry,” he told users after the restart . In the lead-up to Wednesday’s Twitter Spaces event, anonymous Twitter employees told The New York Times that they were concerned over whether Twitter could even support the increase in traffic that was expected for DeSantis’s campaign announcement. No planning had been made to account for “site reliability issues” before the event took place, they said. “The technical problems on Wednesday showed how Twitter is operating far from seamlessly, turning what was supposed to be a crowning event for Mr. Musk into something of an embarrassment,” New York Times technology reporter Ryan Mac wrote . Even before the broadcast aired, the event was muddled in controversy. Although Musk falsely purports to be politically neutral, he has shifted the site rightward, publicly mocking progressives and propping up far right figures in his tweets. Last year, Musk indicated that he would support DeSantis for president in 2024 . DeSantis is decidedly far right, with critics denouncing his relentless attacks on marginalized populations in Florida as “proto-fascist.” Under the supposed auspices of “freedom,” DeSantis has attacked the “civil rights of women, immigrants, LGBTQ people, teachers, students, labor unions, and more,” Truthout reporter Mike Ludwig noted . As Florida governor, DeSantis has signed a dangerous six-week abortion ban into law ; denied students their civil rights by signing a law that allows parents and community members to censor books they deem inappropriate (often targeting books with LGBTQ and/or Black characters); and enacted inhumane anti-immigrant policies , even transporting migrants to other states in a cruel political stunt that appears to be illegal . “DeSantis’s lies, policies and embrace of historical revisionism cannot be separated from either an egregious fascist history or the current attempts by the GOP to erase migrants and Black and Brown people from history in order to prop up a white nationalist agenda,” Henry A. Giroux, the current McMaster University Chair for Scholarship in the Public Interest in the English and Cultural Studies Department and a member of Truthout’s board of directors, noted in an op-ed in December 2022 . “There is little doubt that DeSantis has turned Florida into a laboratory of fascist politics,” Giroux added. “Politicians and scholars alike, including Robert Reich (former secretary of the treasury from the Clinton administration) and the historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat, have labeled DeSantis a fascist, and they are right.”
Carlson’s legal team fired off a letter stating he is considering litigation against the network. Former Fox New s host Tucker Carlson on Tuesday accused the network of breaching his contract and announced plans to re-launch his show on Twitter. Carlson announced that he would bring his show to Twitter two weeks after he was ousted from Fox . “Starting soon we’ll be bringing a new version of the show we’ve been doing for the last six and a half years to Twitter,” he said in the video. “We bring some other things too, which we’ll tell you about. But for now we’re just grateful to be here. Free speech is the main right that you have. Without it, you have no others.” We’re back. pic.twitter.com/sG5t9gr60O The move would appear to violate Carlson’s contract with Fox . The network wants to keep paying Carlson to prevent him from starting a competing show until his $25 million-a-year contract expires in January 2025, according to Axios . Carlson’s legal team tried to get ahead of any contractual disputes on Tuesday, firing off a letter accusing Fox of fraud and breaching Carlson’s contract themselves. Carlson lawyer Bryan Freedman argued in the letter to Fox executives Viet Dinh and Irena Briganti that Fox employees, including “Rupert Murdoch himself,” broke promises to Carlson “intentionally and with reckless disregard for the truth.” The lawyers accused Murdoch and Dinh and making “material representations” to Carlson that were intentionally broken, constituting fraud, according to Axios . The letter accused Fox of breaking an agreement with Carlson to not leak his private messages and not to use them “to take any adverse employment action against him.” Carlson’s lawyer also accused Fox of breaking promises not to settle with Dominion Voting Systems “in a way which would indicate wrongdoing” by Carlson and not take any actions in a settlement that would harm Carlson’s reputation. Carlson was told by a member of the Fox board that he was ousted as part of the Dominion settlement, two sources told Axios . “These actions not only breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the Agreement, but give rise to claims for breach of contract, and intentional and negligent misrepresentation,” the letter said. A Fox News spokesperson told Axios that it was “categorically false” that Carlson was ousted as part of the Dominion settlement. “Dominion did not insist on them firing Tucker Carlson as part of the settlement,” an attorney for Dominion told the outlet. Carlson also accused Briganti, the longtime Fox PR chief, of seeking to “undermine, embarrass, and interfere” with Carlson’s future business prospects. “Make no mistake, we intend to subpoena Ms. Briganti’s cell phone records and related documents, which evidence communications with her and all media, including, but not limited to The New York Times ,” the letter said. The letter added that Carlson is considering litigation against the network and said Fox News must take immediate steps to “preserve all existing documents and data” related to the company’s relationship with Carlson. The terms of Carlson’s move to Twitter are unclear. Twitter CEO Elon Musk, who reportedly spoke with Carlson before the announcement and appeared on one of his last episodes on Fox , denied that he and Carlson “have signed a deal of any kind whatsoever.” “Tucker is subject to the same rules & rewards of all content creators,” he wrote, adding that users can flag any misleading information. “On this platform, unlike the one-way street of broadcast, people are able to interact, critique and refute whatever is said,” he wrote. “Rewards means subscriptions and advertising revenue share (coming soon), which is a function of how many people subscribe and the advertising views associated with the content,” he added. “I hope that many others, particularly from the left, also choose to be content creators on this platform.” On this platform, unlike the one-way street of broadcast, people are able to interact, critique and refute whatever is said. And, of course, anything misleading will get @CommunityNotes . I also want to be clear that we have not signed a deal of any kind whatsoever. Tucker is… Nora Benavidez of the progressive non-profit advocacy group Free Press told NPR that Carlson’s move to Musk’s platform “is not even surprising.” “It’s just the latest in a long line of dangerous actions Musk takes to erode open discourse and public trust surrounding the platform,” she said. “Twitter is becoming a fringe network which places hyper-partisanship, lies, and hate over application of corporate policies and robust trust and safety.”
Activists from Mexico are decrying the plan as a prime example of “colonial extractivism.” People were lining up with buckets to get water from a truck last year in Monterrey, Mexico, as two of the city’s three dams almost completely dried up. Now Tesla has plans to build a huge electric car “gigafactory” in that same water-insecure city. A gigafactory is Tesla’s term for its massive assembly and parts plants. The Monterrey one will be built on 4,200 acres — twice the size of the company’s Texas plant, and around the size of three small towns. While the electric vehicles (EVs) that Tesla builds are meant to ease car pollution, the company is passing the water consumption and the high pollution resulting from its manufacturing process on to Mexico. The cars will be sent to the U.S., as most Mexicans could never afford them. The Tesla Gigafactory was announced in March, and CEO Elon Musk said it would be “the biggest electric vehicle plant in the world.” The goal is to build the factory this year and have it running next year. Tesla chose Monterrey, in Nuevo Leon state, because of its low-paid workforce, its proximity to its Austin, Texas, headquarters, and the presence of key suppliers nearby. Last year, for three months, water was rationed for Monterrey residents — it was only available between 4 am and 10 am. People panicked and bought bottled water, to the point where only the smallest bottles were left in shops. Communal owners of ejidos (land owned by communities rather than by individuals or private corporations) protested the lack of water for small farmers and requested economic support because they weren’t able to water crops or feed their animals. Monterrey had “a 40 percent deficit in the necessary amount of water,” Monterrey resident Ismael Aguilar Benítez told Truthout. Specializing in water management, he is a researcher with the Urban and Environmental Studies Department of the Northern Border College (Colef). “Tesla is aiming to build around a million vehicles, and in one of its reports, it says that it uses 3 cubic meters of water per vehicle, so that’s around double the amount of water than the Texas factory,” he said. Aguilar explained that though the company says it will use treated or recycled water — as is already the case in all of Nuevo Leon — he is concerned that the company estimate is low. Its water use will still be very high, and on top of that, “Tesla will attract suppliers and dealers that will also use water, and workers will move to the area, likely an additional 30,000 homes around the new factory.” The region is facing a drought, and Aguilar says it will only pull through this year if there is above average rain. Trying to reassure investors, the state governor commented , “Nuevo Leon has enough water for companies, but not for human consumption.” Tesla will also need lithium for the car batteries. And while Mexico nationalized control of its lithium in February, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has said he is open to Musk exploiting the light metal in Sonora state. Producing one EV lithium battery involves digging up 500,000 pounds of earth. The mining of other minerals to build the EVs also has serious environmental and health impacts, and that cost is almost always borne in the Global South. The EV production process, including the battery, emits 13 tons of CO2 per car, compared to 10.5 tons for combustion engine cars. Aguilar worries that even if Tesla complies with state pollution regulations, “big companies tend to transfer their negative impacts to small companies — to suppliers — and they end up contaminating (air and rivers). The impact on Monterrey could be very serious.” Trying to reassure investors, the state governor commented, “Nuevo Leon has enough water for companies, but not for human consumption.” In Puebla city, in the center of the country for example, foreign car manufacturers like Audi and Volkswagen are among the main companies responsible for the low air quality. They are polluting the air with benzene, which can lead to anemia, hemorrhages, weakened immune systems and even cancer . Aguilar said the high population density in Monterrey and high dependence on cars in the city means there is a lot of traffic. In fact, Monterrey ranked 11th out of 991 cities for traffic congestion. The new Tesla factory and the infrastructure that comes with it “will mean more cars in the northwest of the city and will make things worse,” Aguilar said. Mexico is the seventh-biggest car producing country, but 90 percent of vehicles are sold abroad, with 76 percent going to the U.S. The cars that transnationals in Mexico export are “very safe vehicles that meet international standards for safety systems … meaning they are safer for drivers, passengers and for pedestrians. But the vehicles made for Mexican consumption aren’t as safe and don’t meet those standards,” Armando Pliego, a spokesperson for the Safe Mobility Coalition, a Mexican network of 97 specialist and civil society organizations campaigning for safer and better transport, told Truthout. The so-called free trade agreements that Mexico has had with the U.S. and Canada (first NAFTA and now USMCA) have given U.S. and Canadian companies great advantages, at the expense of Mexico. The companies — including Tesla — receive tariff-free imports, exploited labor, cheap water, electricity and land, send the products and profits to their headquarter countries, and leave Mexico polluted and struggling to access water. For Karen Castillo, member of the Memory and Freedom Observatory, which documents attacks against activists and social movements in Mexico, the new Tesla Gigafactory is “part of a historic policy towards Mexico of extractivism, in which other countries come here and take advantage of the land, strip it and destroy it for the economic benefit of their countries and companies … and of course this Tesla plant is part of this pattern of ecocide and colonial extractivism.” She told Truthout, “This process has been speeding up in Mexico; the door has been opened to companies so that they can come here and … use our resources without any concern for what happens to the environment, to nearby communities.” Castillo is participating in a 10-day caravan of activists that is visiting communities that are resisting other large commercial or industrial projects being built without consultation or concern for their impact. “It is mostly rural and urban communities that are resisting these actions, so they are the ones being demonized and criminalized,” she said. Another irony of the Tesla plant is that not even the wealthiest Mexicans could afford an EV. Tesla’s cheapest model is $ 55,000 in U.S. currency. On average, Mexican workers make just $ 366 in U.S. currency a month — while the majority informal workers would make less. The cheapest Tesla is more expensive than many homes, and 10 times more than a secondhand car. A U.S.-based study found that people who can consider buying an EV typically have homes already, degrees and multiple vehicles. They have an average annual income of $150,000 in U.S. currency or more, while even the top 1 percent of Mexicans only earn an average of $81,093 in U.S. currency. The new Tesla Gigafactory is “part of a historic policy towards Mexico of extractivism.” Further, EVs require new infrastructure and certain living conditions, like garages for chargers. McKinsey estimated that EV infrastructure would cost the U.S. $35 billion to meet demand by 2030. Mexico and other Global South countries don’t have those sorts of funds: A lot of roads in Mexico are still dirt and many of its hospitals are severely lacking, so spending money on EV chargers shouldn’t be a priority. “A lot of Mexico’s urban areas were developed without much planning, so many of the poorer areas are far away and not well connected with services,” Pliego said. He described a model of urban development that “privileges cars” and the people who are able to own them. “If we just substitute one kind of car for another, all that is happening is road insecurity or traffic congestion is being electrified … and an increase in EV chargers would cause an increased strain on the already struggling electricity grid,” he said. Spending on EV infrastructure would divert more resources — money, energy and physical space — toward private vehicles, instead of the public transport people need, he argued. While just 25 percent of Mexico’s population uses cars, cities spend 47 percent of their transit budgets, on average, on car infrastructure and nothing on public transport. The federal government spends 1.2 percent of its mobility budget on public transport. Governments rent out bus routes to private companies that then focus more on profits than on providing a good service, Pliego explained. “Public transport has been abandoned. We need a transport planning vision that takes different needs and patterns of movement into account,” he said.
“We’re clearly being exploited by a billionaire and his pet project,” says an activist targeted for protesting SpaceX. We get an update from South Texas, where Elon Musk’s SpaceX rocket blew up four minutes after launch Friday and residents reported particulates or ash rained down on their neighborhoods near the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge. We speak with Bekah Hinojosa of Another Gulf Is Possible, who has been targeted for participating in protests against SpaceX. She says, “We’re clearly being exploited by a billionaire and his pet project.” She also responds to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s approval Thursday of three new liquified natural gas projects in the area. This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to South Texas, where Elon Musk’s SpaceX is claiming success after the first launch of its massive new rocket, dubbed “Starship.” The two-stage prototype lifted off Thursday morning from SpaceX’s sprawling base on Texas’s Gulf Coast near the U.S. border with Mexico, becoming the largest and heaviest machine ever to fly under its own power. At least six of the rocket’s 33 engines failed during flight. The vehicle self-destructed over the Gulf of Mexico about four minutes after liftoff. Residents of Port Isabel, near the launch site, reported particulates or ash rained down on their neighborhoods. The fiery end to the launch was the latest in a series of explosions around SpaceX’s launch site near the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge. This comes as three liquefied natural gas projects in the Rio Grande Valley were just approved by the FERC. That’s the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Indigenous, environmental and community organizers responded Thursday to the SpaceX launch and explosion and denounced the new projects. This is Christopher Basaldú. CHRISTOPHER BASALDÚ: Rio Bravo Pipeline and SpaceX, none of these companies consulted with the original people of this land, the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe of Texas. None of them consulted with the tribe. None of them have our consent. But yet, they still want to destroy Native homelands, ancestral homelands. We never gave our consent, and they’re moving forward. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, they never consulted with the tribe. They don’t have our consent, and they’re moving forward anyway. That’s not justice. … They’re enabling Musk to destroy our lands and destroy this beautiful area. It needs to stop. These are all the histories of colonial genocide against Native people and Native lands. AMY GOODMAN: For more, we’re joined in Brownsville, Texas, by Bekah Hinojosa, an environmental and community advocate with the grassroots collaborative Another Gulf Is Possible. She’s one of the many people who spoke out against SpaceX and faced repression and prosecution. Last year, police broke into her home and arrested her after she was accused of spray-painting the words “gentrified” and “stop SpaceX” under a mural in downtown Brownsville. She’s still fighting these charges. Bekah Hinojosa, welcome to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us. So, yesterday, Elon Musk declared success when his SpaceX rocket exploded. Now, actually, though he was, of course, mocked by many — what does a failure mean if your rocket explodes out of control? — scientifically, it’s a chance to test different ways of trying to shoot off this rocket. But you’re on the ground. If you can talk about what SpaceX means for your communities? BEKAH HINOJOSA: You know, we’re tired of living under the constant threat of flammable rocket explosions because of SpaceX. You know, Elon Musk is on his quest to colonize Mars, and it’s beginning — he’s beginning by colonizing our community that’s on the frontlines of the U.S.-Mexico border, you know, that’s on the frontlines of the Gulf Coast, where we’re dealing with layers and layers of injustices. You know, our community is opposed to SpaceX’s operations. Yesterday, 27 organizations from the Rio Grande Valley signed on to a letter officially opposing the rocket launch. AMY GOODMAN: So, talk about how — who controls where he does this work? And, in fact, does he choose this area of Texas on the Mexico border because of the deregulation of Texas and the fact — what kind of regulation does he face? And what kind of consent is required, if any, of the local community? BEKAH HINOJOSA: It’s very clear that Elon Musk moved into our border community to take over, to colonize the region. We’re clearly being exploited by a billionaire and his pet project. You know, we are a low-income community of color. And Texas has a long history of deregulation, of just rubber-stamping permits and approvals for any big industry, and also give out numerous tax subsidies. You know, that’s what we’ve seen with SpaceX. He’s moved into our community and turned us into a testing ground. It’s at the point now where I hear a noise, my family and I, and we wonder, “Is that SpaceX?” And we come to find out that the rumble is because of a rocket launch. Or I hear a huge explosion or blast from 10 miles away, and it turns out that SpaceX has done some kind of unannounced rocket testing. You know, we’re constantly dealing with just the growth of SpaceX and their operations. AMY GOODMAN: So, Bekah, last year, you were violently arrested after police broke into your home without showing you a warrant. You were detained for, what, more than a day, for 26 hours. Police took your glasses. They placed you in a cold cell, after you were interrogated, charged with what? A misdemeanor? Accused of spray-painting these words “gentrified” and “stop SpaceX” under a mural in downtown Brownsville. The outgoing Brownsville Mayor Trey Mendez posted a photo of you on his social media, thanking the police for your arrest. He also wrote, quote, “Ms. Hinojosa has been quoted in several anti-SpaceX articles.” Can you talk about the former Mayor Mendez’s ties to SpaceX, and how local officials have come after environmental and community advocates, like you, over opposition to SpaceX? You’re still fighting these charges? BEKAH HINOJOSA: You know, I’m still — I’m steal dealing, fighting to have this charge dropped against me. You know, SpaceX is growing into our community. SpaceX and Elon Musk are actively handing out money here and there, and it’s becoming political hush money. You know, it’s buying out politicians. We’ve seen when a SpaceX testing goes wrong, which it always goes wrong, and burns down wildlife refuge, you know, political officials just turning the other way. And I’ve been personally impacted now by SpaceX buying out community member — buying out politicians, when, you know, last year, four police broke into my apartment. When I asked for a warrant and tried to put on my shoes, they threatened me with resisting arrest. They jailed me for 26 hours. And then I come to find out, once I’m released, that Mayor Trey Mendez, who’s still in office for the next month, has doxed me. You know, he posted my mugshot on his official Facebook page. AMY GOODMAN: He’s the current mayor. BEKAH HINOJOSA: He is the current mayor. His term ends in May. He’s chosen not to run for reelection. And I’ve come to find that the mayor has doxed me. He published my mugshot on his official Facebook platform. He posted my job, trying to get me fired. You know, he singled me out and targeted me because I’ve been publicly — I’ve been speaking up about the dangers of SpaceX for years. And what this means is that, you know, the city is signaling to us that any community organizer speaking up could be next. They’re targeting community activists. And we are actively rallying and pressuring the city to investigate Mayor Mendez for abuse of power. You know, we won’t tolerate elected officials singling out and targeting and doxing community members. You know, the city is signaling to us that they’re selling out to a private space industry. AMY GOODMAN: Talk about how the environment has been impacted. For people who were watching TV to see the SpaceX launch, you see in the upper left “Boca Chica.” Talk about Boca Chica, where the fresh waters of the Rio Grande trickle into the Gulf of Mexico, the beaches and protected lands, such as the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, near SpaceX. BEKAH HINOJOSA: Yeah. I want to make it clear that Boca Chica Beach was never for sale. You know, Elon Musk has come and colonized our region. Boca Chica Beach is part of a state park. It’s part of the Lower — near the Lower Rio Grande Valley Wildlife Refuge. It’s part of an international wildlife corridor that’s very important for species to migrate, for genetic diversity. Boca Chica Beach and the entire region is also sacred lands of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe. And, you know, families have been going there for generations to fish. Boca Chica Beach is considered the poor people’s beach, because it’s for local people that go, don’t have to pay fees to enter, and can go fish to feed their families. It’s also where the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe hold their sacred ceremonies. And Elon Musk and SpaceX have been using their private police force and the local police to turn people away, so he can host his press conferences and parties and test dangerous rocket equipment. You know, that’s what we’ve been seeing. You know, some of the routine testing has caused over 60 acres of the wildlife refuge to burn down, has sparked grass fires. We’ve seen threats and death of migratory birds and endangered species like the ocelot. AMY GOODMAN: I also wanted to ask about this point that we raised in the lede, as well, and that is, last year, the Federal Aviation Administration determined that SpaceX’s plans for orbital launches would have no significant impact on the Gulf Coast region. The FAA’s ruling came after SpaceX founder Elon Musk accused the agency of having a fundamentally broken regulatory structure, after it didn’t rapidly approve an early Starship test flight. The FAA has also reportedly faced pressure from major SpaceX contractors, including NASA, Pentagon and the National Reconnaissance Office, all of whom rely heavily on SpaceX to launch satellites and astronauts to orbit and beyond. NASA has selected, for example, a version of SpaceX’s Starship as a lander for its upcoming Artemis III mission, which aims to return astronauts to the moon for the first time in half a century. So they’re using this private company for the Pentagon, for the FAA, for all of this NASA work. BEKAH HINOJOSA: No, it’s very clear that Elon Musk and SpaceX has become — you know, is becoming too big to hold accountable, and is getting away with harming our community. And what we need are real solutions. We need investments, you know, in Earth, the problems we have here on the planet, climate change. And instead, we see our tax subsidies go towards a billionaire’s pet project, for a billionaire to go to space as part of his sci-fi adventure. AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to finally ask you about the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approving the Rio Grande LNG, Texas LNG, you know, liquid natural gas, and the Rio Bravo Pipeline Thursday, just hours after the SpaceX explosion. These projects are within a few miles from SpaceX and have faced fierce opposition from groups like yours. Talk about what’s at stake with these projects, especially in the Rio Grande and the Gulf of Mexico as area of the country that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis. BEKAH HINOJOSA: Yeah, we’re dealing with layers and layers of environmental disasters here in the Rio Grande Valley. You know, communities, we’ve been — I’ve been fighting back to stop these LNG terminals for nearly a decade. Rio Grande LNG, Texas LNG and the Rio Bravo Pipeline plan to build next door to SpaceX, within six miles. And we’re terrified of the very real threat that exploding rockets next to giant tanks of gas, next to giant tankers of gas, where we’ve already seen, you know, rocket shrapnel raining even further past six miles. And we’re being left in the dark. We haven’t heard from regulatory agencies about the flammable risks. And communities here have made it absolutely clear that we oppose these LNG export terminals. All of our communities have passed anti-LNG resolutions — Port Isabel, South Padre Island, Laguna Vista, Long Island Village — because of the threat of flammable explosion from SpaceX, because this would completely destroy our way of life. We are one of the last little pieces of the South Texas coastline that doesn’t have refineries or flare stacks. And, you know, LNG would completely change our way of life for the worse. AMY GOODMAN: Well, Bekah Hinojosa, I want to thank you for being with us, environmental and community advocate with the grassroots collaborative Another Gulf Is Possible. Coming up, we go to Yemen, a leading human rights activist there, where at least 79 people died this week in a stampede. He’ll talk about his country being devastated by the U.S.-backed Saudi war. Stay with us. AMY GOODMAN: “Morning (Manhã)” by Azimüth. It was announced this week that Ivan “Mamão” Conti, the founding drummer of Brazilian jazz-funk greats Azymuth, has passed away.
Musk’s attacks on the outlet serve not only as an attack on journalists, but on public goods as a whole. Elon Musk went on a tirade against NPR on Wednesday, calling for the outlet to be “defund” after it announced that it will no longer be posting on Twitter in the wake of the right-wing billionaire’s latest attacks on journalism and the free press. “Defund @NPR,” Musk wrote on Wednesday afternoon as he fired off numerous tweets attempting to justify the decisions that ultimately drove the outlet off the website. Earlier that day, NPR said that it will no longer be posting on the website after Twitter labeled its account “state-affiliated media.” “At this point I have lost my faith in the decision-making at Twitter,” said NPR CEO John Lansing, adding that he “would need some time to understand whether Twitter can be trusted again,” before deciding whether NPR would ever return to the platform. The “state-affiliated media” label, seemingly assigned at Musk’s behest, has been condemned by journalists and free press advocates as an attempt to delegitimize NPR ’s work, likely motivated by the right’s perception of the outlet as left-leaning. That lean has long been disputed by those actually on the left , who maintain that NPR routinely elevates right-wing voices and whitewashes and legitimizes imperial violence — all while parroting talking points hand-picked by its corporate sponsors . To the right, however, it’s irrelevant that the gap between NPR ’s and Musk’s ideologies may not be as wide as it appears — it only matters that the public believes that NPR leans left, as with other establishment outlets frequently attacked by the right, like CNN or The New York Times . Ultimately, far right attacks on the media serve to push traditionally “center” outlets, like NPR and The New York Times, even further to the right; right-wingers have also hurled unfounded accusations of left-wing bias against other U.S. institutions , like the FBI, with the aim of pushing them further into fascism. In order to bolster its claims that NPR is biased toward the left, the right has been attempting to inflate the proportion of funding that the outlet gets from the government; Musk claimed on Twitter on Wednesday that because NPR once pointed to federal funding as “essential” to its reporting, the outlet should not be considered legitimate. NPR shot back, pointing out that it gets less than 1 percent of its funding from federal sources and that, regardless of the proportion, the outlet operates independently, without government influence. Largely excluded from the conversation, however, is the longtime left-wing position that public funding for the media is often a healthy function of a fair and democratic society. Without public money for journalism, media outlets become more and more reliant on corporate funding, which presents its own biases; according to NPR ’s website , about 39 percent of its funding in recent years has come from corporate “sponsorships.” Biases due to corporate sponsorship have been well-documented. Politico has long accepted sponsorship from corporations like Lockheed Martin and major fossil fuel companies, leading the outlet to parrot industry talking points; outlets like Axios have operated similarly. Meanwhile, corporations are gutting local news outlets across the country, posing a threat to democracy at large. Twitter users and pundits have also pointed out that Musk’s companies have gotten tens of billions of dollars from federal and state governments, and have lobbied for yet more money from the government, even as Musk has publicly complained about government funding. For many conservatives, however, the thrust of the squabble appears to boil down to a longtime struggle between the left and the political establishment: For the right, it is okay for the government to spend endless amounts of money funding corporations — socialism for the rich — but it is irresponsible or bad for the government to spend even a fraction of that amount on public goods — rugged capitalism for the poor.
The debacle over verification is a show of Musk’s right-wing politics and opposition to journalism and the free press. Over the weekend, self-described free speech absolutist Elon Musk appeared to personally request the removal of the blue check verification for The New York Times ’s Twitter account as he derided the publication’s reporting as “propaganda” and its social media feed as “diarrhea.” On Saturday, Twitter was slated to remove blue check marks that, before Musk’s takeover, indicated that a user’s identity was verified. While the verification system was not without its flaws , Musk has further muddied the waters by allowing people to pay for a verification check, which has resulted in widespread confusion, impersonation and scamming on the website. The mass removal of verified checks never came, however. Rather, Musk appears to have removed only The New York Times ’s check so far, while rolling out more features to blur the line between paid and verified users. The publication lost its verification status after a user, DogeDesigner, posted a meme poking fun at The New York Times for announcing that it wouldn’t be paying for verification. Two minutes later, Musk replied , “Oh ok, we’ll take it off then.” Less than an hour later, Musk openly criticized The New York Times , a longtime target of right-wingers for its perceived left-wing lean ( a lean that the left has repeatedly said is virtually nonexistent, especially in its recent coverage of transgender people). “The real tragedy of @NYTimes is that their propaganda isn’t even interesting,” Musk wrote. “Also, their feed is the Twitter equivalent of diarrhea. It’s unreadable. They would have far more real followers if they only posted their top articles,” Musk continued, ignoring the fact that reports estimated last year that the vast majority of Musk’s own followers are bots. “Same applies to all publications.” Musk’s criticisms betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the way his own website’s algorithm works, and how publications structure their social media strategies in general. Publications like The New York Times often aren’t aiming for every tweet to be served to a user, but rather are aiming for their content to cast a wide net, knowing that users will be served a curated selection of their posts based on a platform’s algorithm. Musk’s criticism also constitutes an attempt to delegitimize the free press, particularly outlets that might report accurately on the right or on Musk’s failed ventures; The Times , for instance, recently released an article detailing the erratic nature of Tesla’s self-driving feature, which has made the company the target of several lawsuits. The article, which features opinions from numerous Musk supporters, raises questions about whether or not the self-driving feature was rolled out before it was ready for public use. That only The Times lost its verification when this move was supposed to affect thousands of users appears, then, to be a targeted attack on the publication. At the time of writing, outlets like CNN , Fox News and The Washington Post still have their check marks. Other sections of the Times like its Arts, Food and Travel sections are also still verified. Even other prominent organizations that have said they won’t pay for Twitter Blue — the platform’s paid check mark system that is slated to cost $1,000 a month for organizations — still have their check marks. Though Politico and the White House have both said they won’t pay for Twitter Blue, both accounts maintain their check marks as of this writing. Another change implemented by Twitter this weekend makes it impossible to tell if an organization still has its check mark because it began paying for Twitter Blue. In the past months, Twitter has allowed users to see whether a check mark was paid for or came as a result of verification — but now, the platform doesn’t distinguish between the two, making it even more difficult to tell if an account is real or made by an impersonator. Later on Sunday, Musk derided The Times for its hypocrisy, saying that it is “incredible hypocritical” for the publication to have its own subscription service while refusing to shell out $12,000 a year for a Twitter check mark — seemingly in ignorance of the fact that The Times has a subscription to offer a service, while Musk has massively devalued the supposed service that a check mark is supposed to bring. Musk’s move against The Times comes amid a hard right turn for the billionaire. Musk has long been a right-winger, even as he has sometimes posed as a liberal, seemingly to fit in in Silicon Valley. But his far right politics have been on full display in recent months; since his takeover, he has implemented policies to favor far right voices, banning journalists who have criticized him and giving extremist right-wing figures exclusive access to Twitter’s internal systems in order to demonstrate his supposed reasoning for changing Twitter policies to even further favor the right.
The union has filed a complaint saying that the firings were retaliation for unionizing. Dozens of Tesla workers in Buffalo, New York, were fired the day after workers announced their unionization campaign, a move that the union says amounts to illegal union busting. According to Tesla Workers United, over 30 workers at the Buffalo “Gigafactory” were fired on Wednesday after workers went public with their union effort the day before, sending a letter to right-wing billionaire CEO Elon Musk asking him not to interfere with the union effort. At least one of the workers who was fired is a member of the union’s organizing committee. Workers United, under which workers are unionizing, has filed a complaint over the firings, per Bloomberg . The union says that workers were fired “in retaliation for union activity and to discourage union activity,” and is seeking a federal injunction to stop the firings. It is illegal for companies to fire workers in retaliation for pro-union views or activities. “These firings are unacceptable. The expectations required of us are unfair, unattainable, ambiguous and ever changing,” the union wrote in a statement. “For our CEO, Elon Musk, to fire 30 workers and announce his $2 billion charity donation on the same day is despicable. We stand as one.” (Musk announced on Wednesday that he donated $2 billion in Tesla shares to an undisclosed charity last year. When he made a similar donation in 2021 , it went to his own foundation.) Organizing committee member Arian Berek, who was fired, said that the decision left them dumbstruck. “I got COVID and was out of the office, then I had to take a bereavement leave. I returned to work, was told I was exceeding expectations and then Wednesday came along,” Berek said in a statement. “I strongly feel this is in retaliation to the committee announcement and it’s shameful,” Berek continued. Unionizing workers have pledged to continue organizing, but say that the atmosphere in the office is extremely fraught as workers brace for more potential firings. “Everybody in the office is nervous,” Alexandra Kowalewski, a data analyst at the factory, told Vice . “It’s an edgy atmosphere, and not a good kind. It’s nervewracking.” According to Kowalewski, management claimed that the firings were based on performance, even though workers’ performance reviews weren’t due until March. “It is very suspicious that it was ahead of schedule,” Kowalewski said. “Frankly, things are never ahead of schedule at Tesla.” If workers’ union effort is successful, they will form the first union at Tesla. The workers are attempting to unionize employees who analyze data for Tesla’s self-driving technology as well as manufacturing workers at the plant, roughly 1,800 workers in total. Tesla and Musk are notorious for being anti-union. Both Tesla and Musk have repeatedly been found guilty of violating workers’ rights; Musk in particular seems to be vehemently anti-worker, as recent reports on his ownership of Twitter have shown the brashness with which he treats his workers, especially when they fail to sufficiently inflate his ego . Musk, who is seemingly obsessed with taking any measure possible to cut costs and boost his enormous fortune, likely views a union as a threat to his ability to act with relative impunity. Firing workers in response to union organizing is an especially disruptive anti-union tactic — and one that union-busting companies use often. In Starbucks workers’ union drive, the company has fired over 200 union leaders, according to the union. The practice has become so common for Starbucks that labor officials have sought a federal injunction against the company to stop it from firing union supporters, saying that widespread terminations are having a major “chilling effect” on the union campaign. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has been trying to crack down on this practice. For years, when companies were found to have illegally fired a worker, they were only responsible for the worker’s back pay — essentially just the cost of business. But the NLRB ruled in December that employers now have to pay for debts incurred by an employee due to the firing, like late rent payments, medical expenses or credit card debt.
If the workers are successful, they will form the company’s first-ever union. Tesla workers in Buffalo, New York, are seeking to form the company’s first union, the workers announced on Tuesday, with help from leaders of the Starbucks union effort that has seen prodigious success over the past two years. “We want Tesla to be the company we know it can be. Our union will further Tesla’s principles and objectives, including by helping to serve as the conscience of the organization and by ensuring and deepening our culture of trust and respect,” the union wrote in a statement urging the company to commit to not interfering with the union effort. The workers are unionizing with Workers United, an affiliate of Service Employees International Union (SEIU). They sent an email to Musk on Tuesday announcing their intent to unionize, and are planning to hand out Valentine’s Day cards at work on Tuesday that read “Roses are red / violets are blue / forming a union starts with you,” with a link to a website where workers can sign union cards, per Bloomberg . Buffalo really is a union town. Proud to stand with Tesla workers organizing for a voice on the job. pic.twitter.com/M0GRXesqZ6 The workers in the Buffalo “Gigafactory,” who label data for Tesla’s self-driving program, say they face time pressures at work and are monitored by the company, which tracks their productivity through keystrokes. Workers say these pressures lead employees to skip bathroom breaks. “People are tired of being treated like robots,” union organizing committee member Al Celli told Bloomberg . “We have such a rush to get things done that I don’t know if it’s actually being well thought out,” Celli continued. “It’s just, ‘Let’s get this out as fast as we can.’” There are over 800 workers analyzing Autopilot data in this position, according to the union, with a starting pay of around $19 per hour, or just under $40,000 a year for a 40 hour work week, which workers say is low for their position. The company fired hundreds of these workers last year. The workers are seeking better job stability, higher pay and lighter productivity pressures from the company, which is owned by conservative billionaire Elon Musk. They are also seeking to organize roughly 1,000 workers in manufacturing at the Gigafactory, and have received guidance from leaders of the Starbucks union campaign like Jaz Brisack , who labor officials found was illegally fired by Starbucks for her union leadership last year. “I believe in Tesla, our mission, and the work I do at the company,” Tesla worker Zahra Lahrache said in a statement. “As much as I love my job, it can feel very disheartening living paycheck to paycheck when I work for one of the most successful companies in the world.” “They promised big incentives, but have delivered on little, too late, and in some cases, not at all,” added Tesla worker Tzivyiah Abosch. Workers have tried to unionize Tesla before, but have faced fierce resistance from vehement union opponent Elon Musk. In 2017, workers went public with a campaign to unionize the company’s factory in Fremont, California, with United Auto Workers (UAW) — but after the company illegally fired a union activist, as labor officials found, the union effort fizzled out. Musk has also flagrantly broken labor laws. In 2021, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) determined that a 2018 tweet from Musk discouraging workers from unionizing was illegal and ordered him to delete it. But the tweet remains up two years after that decision. Other reports from employees about toxic work environments fostered by Musk have raised alarm with labor advocates. The right-wing billionaire, who now owns Twitter, appears to be willing to fire workers who don’t boost his ego at the drop of a pin; his first move at Twitter was to lay off workers en masse. Regulators recently ordered the company to reclassify its main office in San Francisco if it wants to maintain the beds it is keeping in the building for workers to sleep in so they can meet their work quotas. Meanwhile, Tesla’s California factory has been sued by the state over allegations of rampant racism at the factory, where workers say they are segregated by race and Black workers face racial slurs throughout the work day.
Though some things may be lost if Twitter fades, the real “magic” behind the platform was never the app, but the people. Twitter’s demise is not just a story about the excesses of another “tech bro.” In October, when Elon Musk took over Twitter, users on the site began experiencing drastic modifications. These ranged from changes to Twitter’s system of “verified” blue checks, which Musk sold off for $8, to a near absence of content moderation and the elimination of most accessibility features. Musk has also raised serious concerns by at least temporarily reinstating previously banned accounts , like that of white nationalist Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes, while suspending journalists critical of his practices. Changes on the site were accompanied by massive layoffs and other changes to the company itself, prompting comments about Musk’s disregard for the expertise and labor of the people who built the platform, as well as other company workers . While it may be easy to trivialize social media, it has become a key institution in our daily lives, reflective of many of the same inequities that affect other institutions. “My critiques of social media, in the end are critiques of capitalism,” said Aimee Rickman, author of Adolescence, Girlhood, and Media Migration , in an interview with Truthout . What varies, she says, is that “social media brilliantly obscures that it is being used in a certain way to profit and that means that extracting all this information, private information from people that can be used over their heads for years to come, or just lead to fear that maybe it will, which has a chilling effect on society, but also a deleterious effect as part of systems that are authoritarian and worse.” Over the past 10 to 15 years, many people have found Twitter to be a useful place to find community, to find an audience that they could not otherwise find in existing communication networks, and to organize others to take action. Steven Renderos is the executive director of MediaJustice , a national racial justice organization that advances digital rights for people of color. In his view, Twitter has previously been very helpful to movements that were able to use the platform to scale up their organizing. “When you think back to the Ferguson uprisings, one of our partner organizations, Color of Change, is famous for saying that it took a million tweets from activists on the ground in Ferguson before CNN paid attention.” Similarly, Kelly Hayes, an organizer with Lifted Voices as well as a writer with Truthout , told me, “I’ve long since lost count of how many people Mariame Kaba and I have helped bond out through Twitter fundraisers we worked on together. My Twitter followers have banded together to do some truly incredible things.” Hayes pointed out that it’s not just about how many people follow a person but more about “how you engaged, and whether you were consistently inviting people to act in concert to do things that were meaningful.” And organizers still rely on social media to build real world networks. Pujita Guha, part of an autonomous collective at the University of California, Santa Barbara, says that social media made it possible to reach out to other constituencies during their recent strike as well as to coordinate across the large University of California system. In particular, Guha says, one of the core audiences for an academic strike was undergraduate students, so social media was useful for explaining what was happening and why. After all, these platforms are where the people are. Twitter is part of a set of social media that have, to some extent, become necessary for not only social movements but for everyday people to go about their lives. Like the various collectives and organizers involved in the UC strike, most people rely on these media to coordinate with others. Hannah Sassaman is the executive director of People’s Tech Project , which supports base-building organizations to identify a vision of what technology should and would do in their liberated worlds. Sassaman pointed out that, “As we’ve seen, through the pandemic in particular, has served as a crucial lifeline for a desperate human need, which is basic connection; it’s how we maintained — and even in some cases, built — necessary human relationships to sustain us through isolation.” This is true, Sassaman said, even as social media is full of contradictions and also “makes us feel like shit.” Rickman said it’s essential to consider why people have been pushed to rely on sites like Twitter for so many of our needs. “What the moment of Twitter under Musk does is provide us a really important lens to look more widely at what spaces we have been offered,” she says, and suggests that people have been driven to Twitter as part of a long, ongoing, historical process best understood as enclosure of the commons. Historically, the commons in Europe were spaces of land owned by no one and shared by all, enclosed and privatized as part of the imposition of capitalism. As capitalism evolved, enclosure expanded to encompass and often decimate many of the spaces where social life and culture take place. Rickman notes the defunding of public libraries , the history of selective code enforcement against independent community spaces including all-ages, queer and other dance clubs, and a host of other ways that free, safe and accessible spaces to gather are closed. As a result, people are driven to the spaces that are left, usually where someone can profit on their presence. Generally, says Rickman, the same people involved in the closure of space are able to then profit from the new spaces. People are driven to social media in part through the systematic elimination of other ways to be together. And once people are on corporate-owned social media, the game is always rigged. “Research has proven time and time again, that the outrageous content, the content that makes you angry, is the stuff that is more engaging on these platforms, because that is the variable that they care the most about,” Renderos said. It’s not only that the platforms are set up to drive conflict — under the guise of “engagement” — but they also enable fascism. “As much as these platforms, especially in the early days, were infrastructure that social movements could leverage to amplify an alternative perspective — the same was true for opposition,” said Renderos. These fascist threats extend as well to the violent language and harassment that activists or users of color may experience while using social media. Corporate social media platforms operate within the context of racial capitalism , meaning the extraction of capital is mutually reinforcing with racialized exploitation and colonialism. Renderos highlights the ways that activists of color have always had a more difficult time organizing on these sites, because of the ways they have been disproportionately censored, particularly when it comes to conversations around race. According to Renderos, the balance appears to be continuing to shift toward one where the platforms lean most heavily toward the successful distribution of myths and disinformation rather than the ability to share grassroots-level resources or reporting that many appreciated in the past. “We live in austerity where we get so little that if we get something nice, it doesn’t matter who it comes from. We bracket off the other parts, because … we need community, we need to feel meaningful, we need to feel like somebody cares,” said Rickman. The cost of seeking these things on social media, however, is high. Given people’s dependence on social media for a variety of needs and its consequent size in our lives, Sassaman thinks about the tech justice she’d like to see in terms of “ non-reformist reforms .” She elaborated, “In order to build towards a vision of liberation where the entire logic of our society isn’t built on racial capitalism, we have to engage with and fight on the terrain of racial capitalism,” which includes social media. Like fighting for non-reformist reforms that decrease the policing budget in an effort to chip away at the overall system of policing, tech justice non-reformist reforms can make tangible improvements in individual user experiences without expanding the power (or purses) of tech corporations. The key is to avoid fighting for reforms or changes that will make it harder to build a liberatory world later on. Sassaman emphasizes the need for campaigns with enforceable demands that can protect and expand the ability to build a base of people online (or the ability to create community-based technology) and can also reduce the targeting and silencing that people of color and other already marginalized people face. Sassaman points to the Change the Terms campaign as an example, which seeks to reduce hate and disinformation online by pushing internet companies to adopt a set of policies that will reduce bias in their algorithms and to increase moderation of hate speech. Meredith D. Clark, associate professor of Journalism and Communication Studies at Northeastern University, hopes that teaching Black users how to archive their Twitter histories will be similarly empowering. Her project, Archiving Black Twitter , aims for users to develop an “archival mindset” to think about their digital selves because “the more you learn about what can be preserved, and then how it might be used, even if it’s not the way that you as an individual, or members of your community are going to use it, the better primed you are to think critically about how businesses and other entities might use that data.” It’s part of the larger project, Archiving the Black Web , which is focused on preserving what’s on the internet — in Clark’s words — “with the knowledge that our families and our communities’ histories, in previous immediate eras weren’t really treated as being worth the effort to archive.” We should not cede any terrain, said Sassaman. “These are the conditions we have…. The internet is owned and built by a handful of major corporations for profit. And they have spent so much money to both lobby and then directly capture, I would say, Washington, state governments and local governments to a degree where independent, community-based technologies are small or impossible. And so, for now, we have to fight on that terrain, we have to educate ourselves about its dangers, and our people about the dangers.” In the meantime, Twitter seems ever closer to collapse, and the other corporate platforms like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube are making it increasingly difficult to cut through the algorithm and engage in activities that challenge capitalism. People are in need of other ways to share information, to fundraise, to build organizing bases, and to simply connect. Many Twitter users have moved to Mastodon, a series of decentralized servers that includes some specifically social justice-focused corners, like Project Mushroom . In talking about these experiments and their decreased reach, Renderos reflected that perhaps “it seems like a moment in which we need to trade off scale for depth in our movements. We really need more depth now to build the kind of coherence in our ideology, and our vision for the world, and our relationship to each other.” Hayes believes everyone should have a Mastodon account “because that’s a space that can’t be bought out from under us,” and that we should support “other experiments in decentralization and noncorporate platforms” so that people “have places we can regroup and create life rafts for our work and our networks” with the ultimate aim of creating a “real public square.” The necessity of these platforms — for movements as well as for everyday interaction — extends beyond Twitter to other apps. Guha, the strike organizer, pointed out that social media includes not only Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, but also chat platforms like Signal, Telegram and WhatsApp, which have also become critical to organizing. “Signal and Telegram definitely have better privacy and they’re less extractive,” she says, referring to the way social media draw on user data and posts to generate profit for elites. “They’re more off the radar, so there’s a lot of organizing and collaborating and so on that happens on these platforms.” Sassaman and others that Truthout spoke with were quick to point out that tech justice needs to be a more serious component of movements for liberation, and a big part of that involves thinking more seriously about what a liberatory technology would actually be. The way out of the trap set up by the corporations that own the technologies almost everyone uses now, is, Sassaman pointed out, to have a strategy for how technology fits into liberation. One model for this positive vision of tech is the Consentful Tech Project and curriculum. The curriculum , authored by Una Lee and Tawana Petty, is a series of lessons for building and using technology that encourages people to move from “protecting ourselves to taking care of each other.” The Consentful Tech Project defines consentful technology as “digital applications and spaces that are built with consent at their core, and that support the self-determination of people who use and are affected by these technologies.” However, Petty cautioned Truthout , “I shy away from thinking of digital and biometric technologies as having the potential to be liberatory, until racial equity is systematized and use of our data is regulated and better governed and understood by those of us whose data are gathered, stored, shared and disseminated.” Thinking about whether liberatory technology must necessarily be limited in scope, like the new Project Mushroom, Renderos warned not to let the current neoliberal conditions limit our sense of possibility. After all, he said, there have been previous experiments in grassroots media that have been able to scale up, like Cuba’s Radio Rebelde . Perhaps movements for social change have not “actually invested in the cultivation of technology.” He wondered what liberatory horizon could be reached if “the radical technologists that exist within our sphere were given the resources to actually build the kind of infrastructure we need?” “I feel like we’ve come to the end of an era of sorts,” says Clark. The future is, as always, uncertain and unwritten. But even as there are things that may be lost if the platform collapses or its utility continues to fade, the real “magic” behind Twitter was never the app. It was people. Clark says that although some important things might be lost if Twitter fades, the platform itself was never the key to Black Twitter. “Black people use the communication technologies available to us to talk about the things that we want to talk about,” she said, referencing how this has been true in every media era, as Black people have built their own independent media outlets. “We are using the tools that are available to us to tell our stories in the way that we want to. We’ll continue to do that, whether it’s Twitter or broadcast frequency, or some other form of media.” Media have long tried to coopt, profit from, and mediate communication between people. And to take credit for the work of grassroots communities. “It was never the app that made the things we did possible. That was us, and we will find ways to keep doing what has to be done, even if Twitter explodes, or if we all leave,” said Hayes. “I believed in us, and I still do.”
Fuentes’s latest ban comes hours after he shared a post amplifying rapper Kanye West’s antisemitic statements. On Tuesday, Twitter reinstated the account of Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist who has given high praise to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler as recently as last week — only to suspend Fuentes’s profile within 24 hours of its reinstatement . The site has not specified why it suspended Fuentes’s account for a second time, but one of the few tweets Fuentes shared while back on the platform referenced antisemitic remarks from rapper Kanye West in which he vowed to go “death con 3” on Jewish people. It is unclear whether the latest ban on Fuentes will be permanent, or whether he will be allowed to return to Twitter at some point in the future. Since Elon Musk purchased Twitter, the social media site has been more tolerant of users who espouse hateful and violent views, reinstating the accounts of several white supremacists and white nationalists who were banned prior to Musk’s acquisition of Twitter. Fuentes was originally ousted from the social media site in July 2021 for repeatedly violating the site’s guidelines . Fuentes has made myriad comments attacking nonwhite people and celebrating acts of violence. In 2021, for example, he lamented that the United States was losing “its white demographic core.” He has also defended the U.S.’s segregationist policies in the Jim Crow era, and has denied significant elements of the Nazi-led Holocaust during World War II. Fuentes has described the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as being “awesome,” and called for the killing of state legislators who refused to participate in a scheme to overturn Trump’s loss in the 2020 presidential election to President Joe Biden. Fuentes became more well known after he, rapper Kanye West and former President Donald Trump had dinner at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in November . After Trump was criticized for agreeing to meet with him and West, who also espouses far right, antisemitic viewpoints , he tried to distance himself from Fuentes, saying he didn’t know who the white supremacist was before the dinner took place. (Notably, Trump has not condemned Fuentes after the fact, as he is reportedly worried that doing so would alienate his base of supporters .) Fuentes, now a campaign adviser for West (who is planning a long-shot presidential run for 2024), has not tampered down his rhetoric in the year and a half since his Twitter ban. Just last week, Fuentes praised Hitler, describing the genocidal dictator as being “really fucking cool.” Before Fuentes’s account was suspended for the second time, Twitter users blasted the site’s decision to reinstate Fuentes and other white supremacists. “Musk alone has built back extremist infrastructure and access to the mainstream. No other large social media site has done this,” tweeted Elad Nehorai , a writer on extremism and antisemitism. “Elon Musk reinstated the Twitter account of Nick Fuentes, who is a white Supremacist notorious for denying the Holocaust and peddling Antisemitism. The venom he spews belongs nowhere on Twitter,” said Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-New York) . “Musk’s reinstatement of Fuentes legitimizes all the vicious garbage the Nazi has spewed, and essentially returns to him a massive avenue to spread it further,” wrote Prem Thakker , associate writer at The New Republic , adding that “the danger of Fuentes’s return cannot be overstated.”
The planned expansion of a SpaceX launch center may destroy ancient village sites and their artifacts and human remains. From an observation deck near the top of his South Texas rocket launch tower, Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX and self-proclaimed proponent of free speech, looks northward to South Padre Island, home to many ancient village sites of the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas. In a video published last May to the YouTube channel Everyday Astronaut, Musk is seen looking over the tower’s railing and down at a “farm” of huge rocket fuel storage tanks filled with liquid oxygen and methane gas. These will service weekly launches of SpaceX’s massive Super Heavy and Starship orbital launch vehicles in 2023. Musk surveys the land from the gleaming metal launch tower, looking down on an ecosystem filled with endangered species, such as ocelots and Kemp’s ridley sea turtles. To the east, he sees the waves of the Gulf of Mexico crashing on Boca Chica Beach, the site of the Carrizo Comecrudo creation story. To the northwest just a few miles away is Garcia Pasture, an archaeological site containing the remains of a pre-Columbian village nearly a thousand years old. Musk wears a black T-shirt with “Occupy Mars” emblazoned across the front, as if his corporate conquest and colonization of space were some sort of righteous protest. As he stands atop his multibillion-dollar mountain of toxic machinery, he cannot see the Indigenous people below who have come to offer tobacco to their ancestors. Musk doesn’t see them because, according to the Carrizo Comecrudo, he is blind to the concerns of the Indigenous people who fought and died for the land he now occupies. “I don’t think they understand what a sacred site is, because they have no connection to anything that’s sacred to their lives,” says Juan Mancias, chair of the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas. In April, Mancias and two other tribal members attempted to make offerings and say prayers at Boca Chica Beach, where the Rio Grande flows into the Gulf of Mexico. These two bodies of water fed the Carrizo Comecrudo for thousands of years, providing them with fish and wildlife, medicinal plants, building materials, and fibers for clothing. But on this spring day, the only road that provides access to the public beach was closed and guarded by a Cameron County sheriff’s deputy. In a video Mancias posted to Facebook, the deputy is seen stopping Mancias’ truck from entering Highway 4, explaining that SpaceX is conducting ground testing. “Today’s one of our holy days,” Mancias says to the deputy. “Of course, this is Holy Week for you guys, for you Christians. But for us, it’s a cross-quarter marker, and we want to come out here and drop some of our tobacco.” The deputy commiserates with them, saying he wished he could let them through, but he can’t. “That’s against the American Indian Religious Freedom Act,” Mancias tells him. “Oh, I don’t know, sir,” the deputy says, quickly changing the subject. In an interview on the YouTube channel Mouth of the Rio Grande, Mancias sums up the situation succinctly: “They say we’re extinct. I say kiss my ass.” The Carrizo Comecrudo endured slavery by the Spanish, indoctrination by Catholic mission schools, intrusion by Big Oil, and fragmentation by the Mexican border and by Trump’s border wall. Now, they face the desecration of their sacred lands by liquefied natural gas plants and the SpaceX launch center, “Starbase.” Last May, the tribe joined the environmental groups Save RGV and the Sierra Club in a lawsuit against Cameron County and the Texas General Land Office, stating that blocking access to a public beach violates the Texas Constitution. The judge dismissed the case, and it is currently on appeal. Bekah Hinojosa, senior Gulf Coast representative for the Sierra Club, says the county now closes Boca Chica Beach and the road to it five days a week from early in the morning to late at night. They have also closed the beach on several occasions simply to allow SpaceX and Elon Musk to have press conferences or to use the beach for their own events. “That’s wrong,” Hinojosa says. “People have been going there for generations. Those are sacred lands of the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe. People need to go out there to fish to feed their families. And Cameron County is allowing a billionaire to close it for his own parties. That’s ridiculous!” The suit is essentially a shot across the bow to get the attention of SpaceX, which began invading Boca Chica in 2014, buying out existing homeowners and moving in an army of tech employees, threatening to gentrify the nearby city of Brownsville, a largely Latino community. The spectacle of rockets also draws scores of tourists to Boca Chica Beach on days when it’s open to the public. What was once a pristine beach where sea turtles buried their eggs is now a dumping ground strewn with empty bottles, fast-food containers, and other litter. Parts of the beach are still black from a wildfire in 2019 set off by a test of SpaceX’s Raptor rocket engine. But what concerns Mancias most is the planned expansion of the launch center and the possible destruction of ancient village sites and the artifacts and human remains they may contain. The launch center was originally designed to handle smaller rockets, such as the SpaceX Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy vehicles. But the company is switching to the much larger Super Heavy and Starship rockets that will eventually place thousands of Starlink internet satellites into low-earth orbit. The company plans to launch up to one rocket a week starting next year, requiring a larger support facility and additional launchpads. The original people of the area were migratory, moving inland during hurricane season, then back out to the gulf during fishing season. Over thousands of years, countless villages formed and dissolved, buried in the marshland soils of the area. “That was a fishing colony there for us,” Mancias explains. “It was a major gathering place during the times when hunting was not available.” In the past, companies doing mining or dredging or other development projects in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas were often caught stealing artifacts and even human remains they found. Some sold them or locked them away in private collections, according to Mancias. According to archived documents at the Texas Railroad Commission, in 1871, surveyors discovered a mound along a proposed rail line that contained the bones of more than 325 men, women, and children. The railroad company at the time questioned a very old local Native man who described how, as a boy, he had witnessed the massacre of his entire village by Spanish soldiers accompanied by Catholic priests. The bodies of his people and family, including his father, who had fought the Spanish valiantly in previous battles, were thrown into a pit and burned. The mound of buried bones the railroad surveyors found was all that was left of the old man’s village. The old man who recounted the story was Manuel Cavazos, the sole survivor of what became known as the Devil’s River Massacre. And he was the great-great-great-grandfather of Juan Mancias, the chair of the Carrizo Comecrudo Tribe of Texas today. No one knows how much of the tribe’s history has been lost in this way. It’s more than likely ancient villages were bulldozed and any artifacts or remains uncovered were lost in the fog of construction when the launch center was first built in 2016. “We have no idea what did with the artifacts … if they just threw them over to the side, or sold them to collectors,” Mancias says. SpaceX did not reply to an email request for comment. SpaceX isn’t the only threat to the traditional tribal lands of the Carrizo Comecrudo. In 2017, the tribe fought against former President Trump’s border wall. Construction of the wall, which continues to this day, threatened the Eli Jackson Cemetery, where many of the tribe’s ancestors are buried. Thanks in large part to the tribe’s efforts, the path of the wall was altered to bypass the cemetery. However, the cemetery is now closed to visitors due to its proximity to the wall. More recently, the tribe has been fighting the construction of two liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants, both of which infringe on Garcia Pasture, an area held sacred by the tribe. The site contains the remnants of a pre-Columbian village around a thousand years old. Earlier this year, the World Monuments Fund added Garcia Pasture to the 2022 World Monuments Watch, and it is included in the National Register of Historic Places. Still, the Rio Grande LNG terminal began construction last month to create a natural gas export facility at the Port of Brownsville that is within the boundaries of Garcia Pasture. The facility will take fracked gas from the Rio Bravo Pipeline and convert it into a condensed liquid cooled to minus 259 degrees Fahrenheit, which would then be loaded onto tanker ships for transport to foreign countries. Cindy Cochran, a researcher for the tribe and general assistant to Chairman Mancias, says she was shocked by pictures of how the massive site was going to be cleared before construction begins. “They just bulldoze everything,” Cochran says. “They don’t care. It doesn’t matter what is there. They don’t think about how they can restore, they don’t think about environmental impacts, nothing. They just get in there and bulldoze.” On Nov. 3, Mancias and his tribe served a cease-and-desist order on the Port of Brownsville and on NextDecade, the parent company of Rio Grande LNG, to stop construction to prevent damage to the ancient village site. Neither organization has yet responded to the letter. The Carrizo Comecrudo have a history and an identity that goes back as far as anyone can remember, fighting and dying for their land and sanctifying it with prayers and ceremonies. Yet they have almost no legal rights to protect it. The Carrizo Comecrudo have been fighting for federal recognition since 1998, but the process takes years; requires teams of lawyers, genealogists, and other specialists; and can cost as much as a million dollars. There are more than 200 tribes in the U.S. that lack federal recognition, many of them stuck in this unimaginably complex process. But the legal protection afforded to most Native tribes, such as the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, only apply to federally recognized tribes. Nevertheless, with a membership of around 1,200, the Carrizo Comecrudo function as a tribal nation like any other. In addition to maintaining and supporting the tribe’s culture and traditions, they regularly come together as a community, along with other Indigenous and environmental groups, to protect Native land and rights. “We work with a lot of people, because we are human beings and we want everybody to be welcomed on our land,” says Christa Mancias-Zapata, tribal secretary and daughter of Juan Mancias, “especially those that are fighting extractive industries helping us to protect our sacred sites and the land itself.” Unfortunately, not being federally recognized means Elon Musk and SpaceX have no legal requirement to consult with the tribe regarding the planned expansion of the launch center. And there is definitely no requirement to gain the tribe’s consent. Musk has bought the favor of local governments with generous donations and received tax breaks and other concessions in return for jobs and an infusion of his famous wealth into the community. So while Musk may not recognize the Carrizo Comecrudo, they definitely recognize him. The wealthy capitalist uses his riches to exploit a new world across the solar system while standing on the backs of Indigenous people here on Earth. He is a colonizer, just like the Spanish who slaughtered the village of Juan Mancias’ great-great-great-grandfather Manuel Cavazos in 1801. And Juan Mancias carries that same fighting spirit. Fighting Musk’s SpaceX empire thus becomes a powerful act of decolonization for the Carrizo Comecrudo tribe. Musk’s goal is to abandon the Earth, while Mancias and his tribe fight to heal it.
Musk has racked up potential labor concerns and conflicts of interest in his Twitter dealings, Warren wrote. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) is raising alarm that Elon Musk is shirking legal responsibilities, misappropriating resources and ignoring potential conflicts of interest in his ownership of Twitter, saying in a new letter to Tesla’s board chair that Musk is treating the social media website as a “private plaything.” In her letter sent on Sunday, Warren raised concern over the way that Musk has handled his purchase of Twitter and the way he has carried out advertising on the platform — actions that could harm Musk’s Tesla and other companies and which are already harming shareholders. She said there could be reason to believe that Musk has “failed to meet legal duty” required of company owners to protect all of the businesses that they own. “One key element of duties is that every Board of Directors of a company with multiple shareholders — especially publicly traded companies — is responsible for ensuring that a controlling shareholder (especially one who is also a Chief Executive Officer, or CEO) does not treat the company as a private plaything,” she said. “That responsibility includes ensuring that Mr. Musk is an effective CEO and that he fulfills his legal obligation to act in the best interests of Tesla and all of its shareholders, not just himself,” she continued. Indeed, some shareholders have raised similar concerns, with Tesla’s third-largest shareholder saying last week that Musk has “abandoned Tesla and Tesla has no working CEO.” Tesla’s shares, which have already dropped precipitously this year, have decreased in value as shareholders have raised discontent over Musk’s Twitter ownership. One issue is Musk’s “misappropriation of Tesla resources,” Warren wrote. That Musk reportedly pulled more than 50 employees from Tesla to work on Twitter “raises obvious questions about whether Mr. Musk is appropriating resources from a publicly traded firm, Tesla, to benefit his own private company, Twitter,” she said. It also raises labor concerns — of which there are many regarding both Tesla and Twitter — about whether those employees have been sufficiently compensated for their extra work. “This use of Tesla employees raises obvious questions about whether Mr. Musk is appropriating resources from a publicly traded firm, Tesla, to benefit his own private company,” Warren wrote. “The imposes a legal obligation on companies to make public any ‘material definitive agreements,’ including employment agreements with executive officers, but Tesla to date has reported no such agreements.” Another issue of concern for the senator is Musk’s failure to disclose or take into account conflicts of interest raised by his ownership of Twitter. In dealing with Twitter advertisers — the main source of revenue for the company — Musk has the power to suppress ads from other auto manufacturers that may compete with Tesla, while also being able to overcharge Tesla for ads on the platform in order to help pay off Twitter’s debts . Warren urged Tesla’s board to take action to clarify these issues to themselves and to the public in order to hold Musk accountable. Musk has been in Warren’s crosshairs before. This spring, as Musk was contemplating the Twitter purchase, she said that both the privatization and his ownership of Twitter would cause huge issues that could have consequences for democracy itself. Allowing Musk to buy Twitter — a platform that’s essentially a town square for journalists, activists and politicians — is tantamount to handing over huge political power to a single billionaire. Indeed, Musk seems to be exposing his right-wing ideology more and more the longer he owns Twitter. During his few months of Twitter ownership thus far, Musk has reinstated anti-trans activists and neo-Nazis while banning Democratic and left-leaning journalists en masse.
Twitter’s CEO is facing backlash from press freedom and civil liberties groups over the decision. Twitter CEO Elon Musk, a self-proclaimed free speech absolutist, suspended a number of journalists from the social media platform on Thursday in what the ACLU condemned as “an attack on free expression” that should be reversed. Musk justified his decision by claiming those suspended — including Drew Harwell of The Washington Post , Micah Lee of The Intercept , Ryan Mac of The New York Times , and Matt Binder of Mashable — shared real-time details about his location, an accusation stemming from the journalists’ reporting on a Twitter account that tracked the movements of the billionaire’s private jet. That account and the person behind it, a college student , have been suspended and Musk says he intends to take legal action, even though the flight information was based on publicly available data . “Criticizing me all day long is totally fine,” Musk tweeted late Thursday, “but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not.” Following the suspensions of journalists, which were carried out without notice or immediate explanation, the Post reported that “none of the tweets from suspended reporters” that it reviewed “revealed the location of Musk or his family.” Musk later insisted that even so much as sharing a link to the flight-tracking account in the course of reporting amounts to a violation of Twitter’s newly amended policy against sharing a person’s “live location information.” As Musk faced backlash from press freedom and civil liberties groups over the decision, he posted a poll on Twitter asking users when he should unsuspend the journalists’ accounts. When a plurality of respondents said the accounts should be restored “now,” Musk tweeted : “Sorry, too many options. Will redo poll.” Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, told NPR that “Musk suspending journalists’ accounts is petty and vindictive and absolutely disgraceful — and especially so because Musk has styled himself, however absurdly, as a champion of free speech.” What message does this send to *other* reporters–the ones who haven't (yet) been purged? Is it tenable for reporters to stay here now that Musk has made clear that they're here at his pleasure, and that he'll eject them if they cross his arbitrary lines? The Committee to Protect Journalists, a watchdog group that defends press freedom worldwide, said in a statement that it is “concerned about news reports that journalists who have covered recent developments involving Twitter and its owner, Elon Musk, have had their accounts on the platform suspended.” “If confirmed as retaliation for their work, this would be a serious violation of journalists’ right to report the news without fear of reprisal,” the group added. Musk’s move also drew attention and criticism from lawmakers. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who has faced death threats and other forms of harassment, tweeted that she understands “feeling unsafe, but descending into abuse of power erratically banning journalists only increases the intensity around you.” “You’re a public figure. An extremely controversial and powerful one,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote. “Take a beat and lay off the proto-fascism. Maybe try putting down your phone.” Edward Snowden, who exposed mass surveillance by the powerful U.S. National Security Agency and is now living in Russia under threat of imprisonment in his home country, weighed in on the suspensions Friday morning, writing that he is “significantly more sympathetic to Elon Musk’s concern about crazy people showing up at the door than the average person because, well, look at my life, but c’mon, man.” “You’re a public figure in a position of power in a world where even normal people are constantly tracked,” Snowden added.
“Maybe try putting down your phone,” she said. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) had a strong message for Twitter CEO Elon Musk on Thursday as he went on an account banning spree on the platform: step back from “proto-fascism” and stop lobbing false accusations of doxing at journalists. “You’re a public figure. An extremely controversial and powerful one,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter in response to Musk claiming, without evidence, that he has been a target of “assassination” threats. “I get feeling unsafe, but descending into abuse of power and erratically banning journalists only increases the intensity around you.” “Take a beat and lay off the proto-fascism,” Ocasio-Cortez continued. “Maybe try putting down your phone.” This week, Musk banned an account, @ElonJet, that has, for years, shared the coordinates of the right-wing billionaire’s private jet. Flight locations — even those of private planes — are part of the public record and can be looked up by anyone, at any time. The ElonJet account was run by a fan of Musk’s who appears to remain fond of the billionaire, even after the account was banned. Musk proceeded to ban several prominent journalists who have covered him critically. He also banned social media competitor Mastodon , where many Twitter users are fleeing to, and is blocking links to the site. Over the past day, in attempts to justify his decision to ban ElonJet and the journalists’ accounts, he has claimed that the accounts have doxed him, meaning that they revealed his location — ignoring that the flight records are public already. In a Twitter Space live chat with some of the banned journalists, a defensive Musk said, “You dox, you get suspended. End of story, that’s it.” However, Musk doesn’t appear to really care about doxing — at least not for anyone other than himself. During his crackdown on accounts that he viewed as critical of him, he posted a video of a person’s masked face and their license plate number asking his 121.6 million followers if they could identify the person — which fits the definition of doxing. Twitter is also, under his direction, working on a plan to force users to share their location data with the company, which raises vast privacy concerns. Despite purporting to give Twitter users a say in what happens with the platform, the billionaire has also thus far refused to reinstate the banned accounts — even though he found in two separate polls that most users wanted the accounts reinstated. Musk staging a poll to determine if the suspended journalists should be allowed back & then rejecting the results when they favored the journalists, is a good example of how fascists operate. He knows what he's going to do. The polls allow his fans to feel they're participating. Ocasio-Cortez pointed out that she has been the subject of violent threats and doxing from the same right-wing figures and outlets that Musk has been uplifting in his months owning Twitter — figures that are far, far more likely to carry out acts of violence than those on the left. “As someone who has been subject to real and dangerous plots, I do get it. I didn’t have security and have experienced many scary incidents. In fact, many of the right-wing outlets you now elevate published photos of my home, car, etc. At a certain point you gotta disconnect,” she said . In response to a user who said that someone should link Ocasio-Cortez’s location in real time to “see how she feels” — something that, notably, does not appear to be happening to Musk — Ocasio-Cortez said , “It happens literally all the time.”
Instead of giving the money to charity, Musk likely “donated” the money for tax-dodging purposes. Recently uncovered financial documents reveal that last year, as Elon Musk was taunting the United Nations over his choice to withhold $6 billion that he said he would donate to solve world hunger, the right-wing billionaire gave the money to a different source: his own foundation. Late last year, Musk donated roughly $5.7 billion worth of Tesla shares, as many wealthy people do through donor-advised funds to avoid paying capital gains and income taxes. The recipient of that donation was unknown until this week, when Bloomberg revealed that a tax filing shows that the donation went to the Musk Foundation, “instantly making it one of the largest foundations in the U.S.,” as Bloomberg reported. The donation came as Musk was stirring up controversy online, arguing with Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) over the fact that billionaires are severely under-taxed in comparison to the general public. Just a couple of weeks before that, Musk had pledged the money to another cause. In late October, director of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) David Beasley pointed out that billionaires like Musk could donate just a fraction of their wealth, which has skyrocketed during the pandemic, to address world hunger. In response, Musk tweeted in a reply to a misleading tweet about Beasley’s remark that he would donate $6 billion — just 2 percent of his net worth at the time — if the UN could prove that the money would solve world hunger, ignoring that Beasley never mentioned solving world hunger altogether with that amount of money. “If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it,” Musk said. The WFP took Musk up on his challenge and issued a report just three days later detailing how it could use the funds to feed 42 million of the people across the world who were most at risk of starvation for a year. Of course, the money from Musk, who is notorious for pledging to do good with his money and influence and then backing out, never materialized — not for the WFP, anyway. Instead, the money went to the Musk Foundation, which appears to be set up in a way that is similar to other foundations started by billionaires; essentially, the sole purpose of these foundations is allowing the rich to dodge taxes while painting themselves as charitable. Such foundations often sit on large amounts of money while charities wait for donations to arrive; indeed, even though the Musk Foundation had about $9.4 billion in assets by the end of last year, it gave only $160 million to charities in 2021. Similarly, the largest foundation in the U.S., the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation — which is by no means innocent of tax-dodging schemes itself — had assets worth $55 billion at the end of 2021 while distributing $6.2 billion in grants, according to a foundation spokesperson. Around the same time last year, Musk sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla stock. While he posted a poll on Twitter asking whether or not he should sell the stock, pretending that he was merely listening to the public, journalists and experts have noted that he likely sold the stock to help meet billions of dollars of tax obligations that had the potential to increase if he put them off, or for other stock-related reasons that he likely ultimately profited from.
The “Twitter Files” elevate false narratives and serve to uplift dangerous right-wing figures. Right-wing billionaire Elon Musk has given prominent conservative figures access to Twitter’s internal systems this week to create and publicize the so-called Twitter Files — a trove of information that Musk is using to “expose” the social media platform’s supposed left-wing bias under its previous management but that, in reality, only serves to spread far right conspiracy theories and propaganda. This week, conservative columnist Bari Weiss was in charge of Twitter Files part two, writing a Twitter thread showing that, under previous management, the visibility of some of the most hateful right-wing accounts on the platform had been limited. Although this was presented as a groundbreaking discovery, Weiss didn’t detail anything about Twitter’s previous content moderation that wasn’t already known. In fact, Weiss’s thesis that Twitter was biased against the right before Musk took over is entirely false: by previous Twitter leaders’ own admission , the platform’s algorithm actually favored right-wing politicians and news outlets in the U.S. and five other countries. Further, while Weiss attempted to show that virulently anti-LGBTQ account Libs of TikTok was censored, her screenshot of the account in Twitter’s back end showed a large banner that instructed employees not to take action to suppress the account without consulting the site’s policy team. In her thread, Weiss only showed moderated accounts belonging to right-wingers and misleadingly highlighted phrases meant to be viewed only by Twitter employees to spread disinformation about how Twitter operated before Musk — all with the likely goal of giving Musk leeway to continue censoring the left and uplifting the right on the platform, under the extremely dubious guise of non-partisanship. Weiss’s thread came after Musk employed increasingly conservative writer Matt Taibbi to do public relations for him in Twitter Files part one last week. Musk used Taibbi to show how Twitter had supposedly suppressed right-wing conspiracy theories about Hunter Biden’s laptop. Taibbi’s smoking gun — internal emails about deleted tweets on Hunter Biden — only revealed that the company had complied with the Joe Biden campaign’s request that the site take down nude photos of Hunter Biden, which the right had attempted to leak without his consent. That Weiss and other conservative figures were granted unprecedented access to Twitter’s back end — and potentially even users’ private messages — is concerning not only for its ideological implications but also for safety reasons , as the screenshots shared by Weiss carry a watermark indicating that she was given access via the company’s head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin. Musk’s Twitter Files — and who he assigned them to — are extremely telling of his intentions for the social media platform. Bari Weiss is infamous among progressive circles for her vehement anti-Palestinian sentiment and screeds against so-called cancel culture that are, in actuality, thinly disguised rejections of anti-racist social justice movements; when she voluntarily resigned from her position regularly writing hateful and widely circulated New York Times opinion pieces, she complained that she was being cancelled. Bari Weiss is on tweet number 22 of her thread on the 'Twitter Files' and alleged shadowbanning etc and it's so weird she hasn't yet covered any of the Palestinian activists who allegedly had their tweets/accounts/etc suspended or shadowbanned. So weird. Matt Taibbi, once a liberal , has aligned himself with the right in recent years, spreading right-wing COVID conspiracy theories in his Substack newsletter, loudly decrying the left, and, like Weiss, deriding “cancel culture ” in part to spring to right-wing fame. Musk apparently gave other prominent right-wing figures special access to Twitter as well. Notoriously transphobic Abigail Shrier, author of the hateful, dangerous anti-trans book Irreversible Damage , said on Twitter that she was part of Weiss’s “team” that was given access to Twitter’s internal systems. In fact, all of the people that Musk has given access to — Shrier, Weiss and Taibbi — are known for their anti-trans sentiments, reflecting a particular hatred that Musk has against trans people .
The report is yet more evidence of Musk’s reign driving Twitter into catering to the far right. In the weeks following right-wing billionaire Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter in late October, Republican members of Congress gained hundreds of thousands of followers on the platform, while Democrats experienced a purge of followers, a new report finds. According to an analysis of ProPublica data by The Washington Post , the biggest shifts in follower counts for Republicans have almost all been gains, with the biggest winner being white nationalist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Georgia), followed by far right Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), both gaining over 300,000 followers each. Senators Ted Cruz (Texas) and Rand Paul (Kentucky) both gained roughly 200,000 followers, while Rep. Matt Gaetz (Florida) added over 100,000 accounts to his follower count. Meanwhile, the largest shifts in follower counts for Democrats have all been negative, save for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (New York), likely because he is poised to take over for Rep. Nancy Pelosi (California) as the next leader of the Democratic caucus. The accounts with the biggest losses belong to Senators Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), both of whom lost over 100,000 followers. Rep. Adam Schiff (California) — a member of the January 6 committee and the target of recent attacks from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California) as well as a slate of false social media posts — has also lost around 100,000 followers. Look, it’s congressional Twitter account follower data from @propublica in this @washingtonpost joint: pic.twitter.com/XaR8s5R6Rd — Derek Willis (@derekwillis) November 28, 2022 Not only do these changes in follow counts generally follow party lines, they also appear to follow the ideological spectrum — some of the furthest right members of Congress gained the most followers, while the most left-leaning members, Sanders and Warren, lost the most. The Post notes that these findings suggest that left and liberal users appear to be quickly fleeing the platform in the Musk era, while right-wing users are joining Twitter or becoming more active. This could also be the result of the fact that Musk appears to be disproportionately banning prominent left-wing accounts , including antifascist activist and researcher Chad Loder and leftist anarchist collective CrimethInc, while elevating and responding to far right accounts. The past weeks and years have shown that Musk is a part of the right wing, even though he insists that he is politically neutral. He urged followers to vote for Republicans ahead of the midterm election, has repeatedly donated to Republicans and has tweeted about dangerous far right conspiracy theories on topics like the attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband and debunked COVID denialism . Musk’s anti-worker, anti-union management style and hostility toward antiracist and other social justice movements also point to a right-wing ideology. Musk has also hinted that he will reinstate former President Donald Trump, who was banned for inciting violence around the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Musk has already reinstated accounts belonging to other far right figures like Jordan Peterson (banned for anti-trans hate speech) and the personal account of Greene (banned for COVID disinformation and violent rhetoric). Such actions have led commentators to speculate that Musk views his ownership of Twitter as a way to advance his right-wing beliefs. “t’s now impossible to ignore the emerging reality that Musk values owning Twitter as a powerful weapon for right-wing activism,” MSNBC columnist Zeeshan Aleem wrote in an op-ed last week. “As the richest man on Earth and a proudly exploitative executive, he has a direct interest in amplifying the power of the right,” Aleem continued. “He shares the Republican Party’s hostility to unions, higher tax rates on corporations and the ultra-wealthy, and regulations on businesses. He also seems to find the left’s growing focus on anti-bigotry off-putting, and he doesn’t like challenges to his authority.”
Musk is reinstating accounts for users previously booted for violating violence and hate speech rules. Following Elon Musk’s recent takeover of Twitter , the billionaire quickly laid off about 50 percent of the company’s staff, including members of human rights, safety and integrity teams , and thousands of outside contractors who moderate content in countries around the world, according to the watchdog group Free Press. Executives in charge of privacy and security resigned on November 10, and roughly 1,000 remaining employees followed. Author and activist Thenmozhi Soundararajan wonders what human rights advocates would do if calls to violence erupt via Twitter in India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist movement is stoking religious tension for political gain . “This is not again about hurt feelings for ‘fragile snowflakes, ’ this is about direct calls to violen ce , and an American company is doing that,” Soundararajan told reporters on Monday. “I would assume there is no brand that wants to be linked to genocide.” Protests erupted as India passed the Citizenship Amendment Act in December 2019, effectively denying full citizenship to Muslims across the country. Twitter struggled to prevent agitators from using the website during Delhi’s deadly riots in 2020 , when observers accused India’s police state of complicity in what amounted to an anti-Muslim pogrom . Until recently, human rights groups and Indian civil society were working with Twitter moderators to update the site’s “slur list” after an existing list failed to adequately identify hate speech in the nation’s multiple languages and dialects. This years-long effort to prevent genocidal hate speech in India wasn’t perfect, but at least there was some layer of protection and Indian civil society was involved, according to Soundararajan. Now, former Twitter moderators who worked with civil society are no longer answering emails. Must they tag @ElonMusk in a tweet and wait? Soundararajan, along with a global coalition of human rights groups and political dissidents, are calling on advertisers to “pause” ad buys on Twitter until Musk can “verifiably” show that his platform will not devolve into a cesspool of violent hate speech, or a tool for tyrants who would spy on their citizens and stifle dissent. Advertising is Twitter’s main revenue stream, and as of last week, at least 50 of the company’s top 100 advertisers had pulled ads from the platform. Companies are often “quiet quitting” to avoid being trolled by Musk’s followers, according to Free Press CEO Jessica J. González. Only a handful of firms issued public statements after dropping ads. “Even before Musk took over, was dangerous for users, especially outside the U.S., where little moderation occurs,” González said in a press call on Monday, adding that Musk’s chaotic new policies are empowering hate groups and authoritarian politicians. “The U.S. has seen a sharp increase in hate speech, and that is in English. Imagine what users speaking other languages are experiencing.” Facing global alarm and outrage, Musk recently tweeted a vague graph purporting to show that hate speech “impressions” on Twitter had dropped to “normal” levels after a spike, but the advocates who have worked with Twitter moderators across the world for years have every reason to be skeptical. They said the graph does not state whether the data on hate speech “impressions” was gathered in the U.S. or across the platform globally, and currently Twitter does not have the capacity to accurately measure hate speech — and crucially, the political and ethnic sentiments that fuel violence — on any sort of international level. Regulators in the European Union and countries such as Germany are watching closely. How did Musk compile the data now that a majority of his employees are gone? Independent researchers have documented a steep rise in hate speech on Twitter. The mainstream media often focus on hate speech on Twitter emanating from the United States, where elections have been marred by misinformation and far right extremists conduct targeted harassment and mass killings, but violence and hate is a complex problem in dozens of countries representing the global majority. White nationalist groups promoting the racist “great replacement” conspiracy theory have used Twitter to network globally, for example. Twitter is also a crucial communications service for nations across Africa and Asia, where content moderation was already sparse and reliant on outside assistance from civil society before Musk sparked a mass exodus of contractors and employees. “Facebook is harmful, but in our markets, they are doing a better job at listening and trying to work with people on the ground to institute these protective measures,” said Rosemary Ajayi, a lead researcher at Digital Africa Research Lab, who worked with Twitter’s team in Nigeria. Ajayi tracked content in Nigeria and other countries that clearly violated Twitter’s rules and how the company responded when the content was reported, an in many cases it took Twitter up to three months to respond, if moderators responded at all. “How does that make sense during an election weekend, when you are responding three months later?” Ajayi said. Working with a skeleton crew and facing massive potential revenue losses, Musk has simultaneously tried to calm advertisers while using his own Twitter account to spread misinformation , taunt critics , troll (or suspend the accounts of ) public figures, and conduct “polls” over sweeping changes to the platform’s longstanding community standards. Advocates say Musk’s polls are arbitrary and likely compromised by bots and trolls. Guided by his polls, Musk is reinstating accounts for users previously booted for violating violence and hate speech rules. Beneficiaries of the new policy include former President Donald Trump, who came under scrutiny for his role in the January 6 riot at the Capitol. Meanwhile, multiple anti-fascist account s were suspended after Musk took over. David Duke, a notorious white supremacist, was recently allowed back on Twitter before activists protested, according to Wendy Via, president of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. Via said the video taken by the perpetrator of the 2019 mass shooting at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, was also recently removed from the platform after being re-posted by far right accounts, perhaps to test the waters of moderation under Musk. “The video of the shooting once again freely circulating on Twitter — it was reported and removed, but given how the bad actors are working right now, it’s probably circulating as we speak,” Via told reporters on Monday. “We just got David Duke off; imagine if allows all of these people come back?” Advocates beyond the U.S. say leaving Twitter altogether is simply not an option, especially in lower-income countries where users rely on Twitter to communicate with each other and local officials during disasters and emergencies. Ajayi said most Americans would be shocked by the experience of Twitter users in Nigeria and other African nations. In the U.S., users are complaining about paying $8 a month to be “verified” by Twitter, which declares an account authentic with an iconic blue check. In Nigeria, Ajayi said, users will pay up to $5,000 on the black market for a verified account on Twitter and other platforms — and all the online power and influence it brings. “I’m African, I am not leaving Twitter,” Ajayi said. “I need to be monitoring the bad actors, so I will be the last one there.”
The resignations are a response to Musk telling workers to commit to “long hours at high intensity” or leave. Elon Musk’s ultimatum this week to the remainder of Twitter’s workforce — to commit to a “hardcore” work culture with “ long hours at high intensity ” or leave — has backfired spectacularly as hundreds of workers have opted out and are resigning, leaving the company with a barebones staff that may not have the capacity to keep the website afloat. The roughly 2,000 to 3,000 workers left at the company earlier this week had until 5 pm on Thursday to click “yes” on a form committing to the “hardcore” culture — what Musk calls “Twitter 2.0” — or receive three months severance. The Verge and The New York Times have reported that hundreds of resignations started rolling in before the deadline; Fortune reported that about 75 percent of the remaining employees opted out of “Twitter 2.0,” with most of the 25 percent remaining on work visas, with little choice but to stay. Musk had already laid off roughly half of the 7,500 workers at the company shortly after he took the helm and has spent recent days firing workers who have criticized him on workplace messaging platform Slack or on Twitter, meaning that there could be only hundreds of employees left at the company. Employees and former employees say that Musk has created an extremely dire situation for the website, essentially manufacturing a ticking time bomb counting down the days — or hours — until critical functions stop working. The Washington Post reported after the deadline had passed that many of the teams on critical systems — “like ‘serving tweets’ levels of critical,” as a former employee said — no longer have any staff. “There is no longer even a skeleton crew manning the system,” the employee said. “It will continue to coast until it runs into something, and then it will stop.” “Every mistake in code and operations is now deadly,” added a former engineer. Any employees who have remained “are going to be overwhelmed, overworked, and because of that more likely to make mistakes.” That Musk appears to be intent on creating a toxic work environment is consistent with his management style at his other companies. Corporate workers at Tesla, for instance, have reported a “cult-like” culture of worshiping the multibillionaire among the staff, while workers at Tesla’s California warehouse have sued several times over what they say is a heinous culture of rampant racism and harassment on the warehouse floor. If only we had taxed the rich maybe none of this would have happened — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) November 18, 2022 Many of the teams working on Twitter’s content moderation have been gutted as well, employees say. The majority of employees who worked to mitigate misinformation, spam and impersonation are gone, according to The Washington Post , and roughly half of the trust and safety policy team has resigned. Major advertisers had already put ad campaigns on the website on hold, with new features and plans announced by Musk giving ad firms representing major brands pause. Before he took over, Musk pledged to revamp the platform’s content moderation in the name of supposed “free speech,” which led to a rise of hate speech and racial slurs on the website. Recent weeks have seen an incredibly haphazard rollout of Twitter Blue, a paid subscription that, for some indeterminate amount of time , allowed users to buy a blue checkmark indicating that their account was “verified” — a designation previously only allowed to prominent political figures, journalists, and other figures that had verified their identity. This feature in particular has raised concerns not only among advertisers — the top revenue stream for the website — but also Congress. On Thursday, a group of six Democratic senators, led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Connecticut), sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) expressing concerns about the platform’s “serious, willful disregard for the safety and security of its users.” The letter was signed by prominent lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts). The lawmakers are urging the FTC to investigate the company for potential breaches of the FTC’s consent decree prohibiting misrepresentation and mandating information security on the platform, as well as for potential violations of consumer protection laws. Musk “has taken alarming steps that have undermined the integrity and safety of the platform, and announced new features despite clear warnings those changes would be abused for fraud, scams, and dangerous impersonation,” the lawmakers wrote. “Twitter knew in advance that there was high likelihood the Twitter Blue product could be used for fraud, and still it took no action to prevent consumers from being harmed.”
The Twitter CEO showed open contempt toward the workers he fired after they criticized him internally. In Elon Musk’s first three weeks as CEO of Twitter, he has orchestrated a firing spree at the company, laying off thousands of workers and, this week, seeking to crush dissent among employees by reportedly firing workers who have criticized him. Overnight on Tuesday, Musk fired around 20 employees who have criticized him on the company’s Slack, a workplace instant messaging platform, according to tech newsletter Platformer . Workers were told that their “recent behavior has violated company policy” in emails, some of which employees received overnight . “My twitter account was protected at the time, so I can only assume this was for not showing 100 percent loyalty in Slack,” one engineer , Nick Morgan, wrote on Twitter. “I’ve heard the same thing has happened to many others now.” In a show of contempt for the workers he fired, Musk tweeted on Tuesday, “I would like to apologize for firing these geniuses. Their immense talent will no doubt be of great use elsewhere.” He also made an ableist comment against one of the fired workers in response to a post by far right harassment account Libs of TikTok. Recent terminations appear to run directly against Musk’s supposed identity of being a “free speech absolutist.” The firings, along with the fact that Musk has begun banning and suspending users who make fun of him on the platform, are instead painting a picture of a man who will not tolerate criticism and who is openly hostile when people who work for him step out of line. The group of firings came after Musk publicly fired an employee, Eric Frohnhoefer, who corrected a post Musk made on Monday about the speed of Twitter. Frohnhoefer, who said he had spent six years working on Twitter for Android, tweeted that Musk should “ask questions privately” of his workers, “maybe using Slack or email” — rather than making public, incorrect statements . In response to Frohnhoefer’s posts, a Twitter user suggested that Frohnhoefer had an “attitude” that Musk wouldn’t want on his team, to which Musk responded: “He’s fired.” Musk’s tweet has since been deleted. Frohnhoefer told Forbes that he didn’t get any official notice about his termination, but, rather, his work laptop was remotely shut down and password protected. Guess it is official now. pic.twitter.com/5SRwotyD8J — Eric Frohnhoefer @ 🏡 (@EricFrohnhoefer) November 14, 2022 The firings came after Musk fired thousands of workers at Twitter, seemingly with abandon. Shortly after he took the helm at the company , he laid off half of the staff, or about 3,700 workers. Then, over the weekend, Musk fired about 4,400 contractors that were working for the company, or about 80 percent of the contract workforce. Even if Musk does stop the terminations soon — and former employees say he will have to if he wishes to continue having a functioning website — the recent round of firings will likely have a chilling effect on employees’ willingness to confront Musk or correct him when he’s wrong. It’s within reason to assume that Musk is aiming to have employees who will capitulate to his every will. Workers at Tesla have reported there being a “cult-like” following for him at the company. “No company have I worked for, in our quarterly meetings, do you clap when a CEO walks into the podium. So that’s just something that people do at Tesla,” one worker told Insider in 2018. Other Tesla workers have been fired after calling attention to publicly-known issues with Tesla cars’ self-driving features online. With Tesla’s seemingly anti-worker environment and reportedly virulently exploitative conditions, the problems appear to be mostly contained within the company. But cultivating such an environment within Twitter could have ramifications far beyond the social media company, as the platform has become a vital tool for journalists, politicians, organizers, and other important figures to communicate. Commentators are noting that Musk will likely turn Twitter into a haven for right-wingers to push their agenda while silencing left-leaning speech, citing the fact that Musk appears to be increasingly conservative, spreading far right conspiracy theories and using his influence on the platform to tell users to vote for Republicans.
Bowman’s troubles uploading a video came after AOC had account issues after using the platform to criticize Musk. As Twitter’s new owner, billionaire Elon Musk, faces intense criticism for his handling of the social media giant and encouraging voters to support GOP congressional candidates, U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman on Tuesday revealed that he spent hours trying to post an Election Day video from his campaign account. “Why isn’t Twitter allowing me to tell people to vote Democrat. Is Elon on his BS right now?” the New York Democrat tweeted just before 6:40 am ET — swiftly adding, “Oh this tweet was sent without a problem.” “Twitter not letting me post videos. This is crazy. Never happened before. What’s Elon doing?” he said with a screenshot a few minutes later. The screenshot showed a Twitter notification that said: “We’re sorry, we weren’t able to send your tweet. Would you like to retry or save this tweet in drafts?” “I swear this keeps happening. Is this happening to anyone else? ” Bowman asked around 7:00 am. Roughly 20 minutes later, he shared : “Still happening! Haven’t been able to post a video for over an hour. What the heck is going on!?” Near 11:00 am, he tweeted : “Ok I seem to have my video posting privileges back… Don’t understand why that took four hours.” However, a few hours later he added : “False alarm. Still nothing.” “I’m literally getting this message all day while trying to share a 31-second video from my phone,” he later wrote with another screenshot. “It’s never happened before. I am a Democratic candidate. Today is Election Day. What the heck is going on!?” Im literally getting this message all day while trying to share a 31 second video from my phone. It’s never happened before. I am a democratic candidate. Today is Election Day. What the heck is going on!? pic.twitter.com/xgJp36H5xI — Rep. Jamaal Bowman Ed.D. (@JamaalBowmanNY) November 8, 2022 The progressive congressman’s troubles with Twitter came after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) had issues with her account last week following her use of the platform to criticize Musk — the richest person in the world, according to Forbes . Ocasio-Cortez joined those slamming Musk’s plan to charge Twitter users $8 per month for a “verified” account, a status signaled by a blue checkmark and typically used to confirm public figures such as politicians, journalists, celebrities, and business leaders are who they claim to be. Lmao at a billionaire earnestly trying to sell people on the idea that “free speech” is actually a $8/mo subscription plan — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) November 2, 2022 In addition to responding to Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet directly, Musk shared a screenshot highlighting the price of a sweatshirt in her online campaign merchandise store. The congresswoman responded by saying that her team “respects working people” and urged the billionaire to “try it sometime.” Proud of this and always will be. My workers are union, make a living wage, have full healthcare, and aren’t subject to racist treatment in their workplaces. Items are made in USA. Team AOC honors and respects working people. You should try it sometime instead of union-busting. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) November 3, 2022 Ocasio-Cortez took to Instagram to share that she was having issues with her Twitter account, saying in a video, “So it turns out, we got under a certain little billionaire’s skin, because I made fun of his silly little plan to charge people for verification and priority placement.” Rep. @AOC (D-NY) claims she had issues with her Twitter account after criticizing Elon Musk: “We got under a certain little billionaire’s skin because I made fun of his silly little plan to charge people for verification … We have a billionaire pressed, like PA-RESSED.” pic.twitter.com/GcrfVTP6nA — The Recount (@therecount) November 3, 2022 The congresswoman then tweeted , “Yo while I have your attention, why should people pay $8 just for their app to get bricked when they say something you don’t like?” “This is what my app has looked like ever since my tweet upset you yesterday,” she added, posting a screenshot. “What’s good? Doesn’t seem very free speechy to me.” Quoting that tweet, actor and activist Mark Ruffalo encouraged Musk to “get off Twitter.” Elon. Please—for the love of decency—get off Twitter, hand the keys over to someone who does this as an actual job, and get on with running Tesla and SpaceX. You are destroying your credibility. It’s just not a good look. — Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) November 4, 2022 Responding to Ruffalo, Musk said, “Hot take: not everything AOC says is accurate.” Musk — whose drawn-out acquisition of Twitter has been blasted by some advocacy groups as a threat to democracy — took to his platform Monday to encourage “independent-minded voters” to turn out on Tuesday for “a Republican Congress, given that the presidency is Democratic,” claiming that “shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties.” To independent-minded voters: Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 7, 2022 Among the critics of Musk’s call for voters to back Republican congressional candidates in the midterms was MSNBC legal commentator and University of Alabama law professor Joyce White Vance. “I fundamentally disagree with this sentiment,” Vance wrote . “I don’t get to vote for the national composition of Congress, I’m picking individuals in specific races to represent me. I try to pick the best person among the choices I have, regardless of party.” “But, if you agree with Elon, I think his balance of power approach only makes sense if both parties are committed to a constitutional republic where voters pick their leaders,” she added. “If one party rejects the peaceful transfer of power, I’m going to vote against their candidates for the good of the country.”
A mass layoff gutted teams dedicated to combating election misinformation just days before Tuesday’s midterm election. Alarm is growing over how the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, is changing Twitter after he spent $44 billion to buy the influential social media platform. Musk fired nearly half of Twitter’s workforce in a mass layoff Friday that gutted teams dedicated to human rights, artificial intelligence ethics and combating election misinformation, just days before Tuesday’s midterm election. This comes after he met with over half a dozen civil rights groups amid concerns he will let misinformation and hate speech go unchecked. We speak with leaders from two of those groups: Nora Benavidez of Free Press and Free Press Action Fund, and Rashad Robinson of Color of Change. “Self-regulated companies are unregulated companies,” says Robinson, who along with Benavidez says Musk has exacerbated already toxic conditions at Twitter and failed to see the “real and porous relationship between the online world and this offline real world.” Both groups are urging advertisers to boycott Twitter unless Musk takes dramatic actions to safeguard rights on the platform. This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman. Alarm is going over how the world’s richest person, Elon Musk, is changing Twitter, after he spent $44 billion to buy the influential social media platform. On Friday, Musk fired nearly half Twitter’s workforce in a mass layoff that gutted teams dedicated to combating election misinformation, just days before Tuesday’s midterm election. In fact, he fired something like 3,700 workers. Those let go included Twitter’s integrity specialist, Kevin Sullivan, who led editorial planning for the 2022 midterms and tweeted, quote, “He couldn’t have waited till Wednesday? #Election2022.” Hundreds of fired Twitter employees on special visas could be deported, like on H-1Bs. Others, who say Twitter failed to give them adequate notice, have filed a class-action lawsuit. The U.N. high commissioner for human rights issued an open letter to Musk Saturday, urging him to, quote, “ensure human rights are central to the management of Twitter under your leadership,” unquote. Meanwhile, after announcing Saturday it would start charging $8 a month for users to have a verification check mark on their profiles, Twitter said it would move the launch to November 9th, after the election. The move came after concerns the new subscription model for verified accounts would allow users to create Twitter handles impersonating political figures or news sources. In fact, some people actually impersonated Musk over the weekend to prove their point. Elon Musk met last week with over half a dozen civil rights groups amidst concerns he’ll let misinformation and hate speech go unchecked. Media Matters, Free Press, dozens more groups urged Twitter’s top advertisers to boycott the platform if proper safety standards are not imposed. In response, General Motors, Volkswagen, Pfizer and General Mills have all paused advertising. For more, we’re joined by people with two of the groups. Nora Benavidez is senior counsel and director of digital justice and civil rights at Free Press and Free Press Action Fund, lead author of the new report , “Empty Promises: Inside Big Tech’s Weak Effort to Fight Hate and Lies in 2022.” She’s joining us from the highly contested state of Georgia, from Atlanta. Also with us, Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change. Rashad, let’s begin with you. You met with Elon Musk. I assume this was a virtual meeting. Can you talk about who was there and what you demanded and what he promised? RASHAD ROBINSON : So, along with other leaders from the Stop Hate for Profit coalition, the coalition that led the $7 billion boycott of Facebook in 2020, focused once again on the issues of disinformation and policy at the Facebook platform, we met with him. And so, it included folks like Derrick Johnson of the NAACP ; Nora’s colleague Jessica González, the head of Free Press; leaders from The Asian American Foundation, LULAC , ADL — and so a mix of organizations and leaders. And so, we met with Elon Musk. We came in with very — with three very focused — three very focused asks that were connected to this upcoming election. One was to not deplatform any of the folks that had been — not to replatform any of the folks that had been deplatformed, and not to replatform them particularly before the election, and, after the election, to have a really clear and transparent policy around how they were going to do it; to keep in place the election integrity unit and the election integrity infrastructure through the election and through certification; and to be more transparent and clear about this content moderation council he’s been talking about, and to be transparent both about the policies of it and its level of power and who would serve on it. And he agreed to each one of those demands on the call — actually, surprisingly, basically said he agreed with everything that we said. We told Mr. Musk that he had to actually say this publicly, if we were going to be able to say anything about this meeting, in a way that really spoke to the fact that he made these agreements. About 1:30 in the morning the next day, he tweeted out, tagging the folks who were in the meeting, including myself, in a tweet, agreeing to these demands. And it wasn’t 24 hours later, Amy, that he began to — we began to hear about the firing. We began to hear about other policy changes. There’s no way you can keep in place election integrity if you fire and let go the very people who are managing the election integrity work. The sort of changes in policy which are deeply abrupt, which speak to, I think, the larger challenges we have with companies that are self-regulated, which means that they are unregulated, and all the ways in which Mr. Musk has sort of engaged and behaved speaks to sort of a person who maybe watched a Broadway show or has a favorite team, a sports team, and has decided that if they were in charge, if they owned that show or they owned that team, this is how they would change things, this is who they would put in a particular role or put in a particular position. And that’s what we’re dealing with right now, is someone who does not have the sort of knowledge or expertise to make these decisions. And while that happens with a lot of companies, we are marching towards an election with a huge communications platform that has a deep role in how information is shared and moved, and it will have deep consequences, any of these changes that we’re hearing, but particularly all the people that have been let go that were responsible for some of the issues that face this platform. The thing I will say is that Twitter wasn’t good before. Twitter wasn’t doing everything it needed to do before. Cutting almost half the staff makes everything even more challenging, moving forward. AMY GOODMAN : Now, of course, we hear that he is asking some of the people he fired to come back. Nora Benavidez, can you weigh in on this issue of the firings? Now staff have filed a class-action suit saying large corporations like this, it’s illegal for them to do that kind of mass firing without any kind of warning. Also the fact that in one of his first acts as owner of Twitter, he tweeted out conspiracy theories attacking Paul Pelosi, who had been hammer attacked in his home and was in intensive care, citing a website that had promoted that Hillary Clinton died in the 9/11 attacks, and she had a body double running for president in 2016. Musk posted the article in response to a tweet by Hillary Clinton. Then he deleted it. The significance of all of this? And what control does civil society have over a private corporation like this? NORA BENAVIDEZ : You know, I think we have to look at the very long track record that Musk has as an erratic CEO . He has taken extreme actions when he dislikes what people say, whether that is on Tesla phone calls, when he rallies his base on Twitter to respond to critics. He has this long trail of ways that he is unable to actually be present and make thoughtful decisions as a leader. The newest actions, in wanting, and then not wanting, and coming back and trying to buy Twitter, all indicate that he is, at best, erratic. And what we’ve seen over the last week, since he actually took Twitter private, has been very disturbing. I would absolutely agree with Rashad that, you know, Twitter was not good before. Twitter was a toxic environment even before Musk. That’s part of what we look at in our “Empty Promises” report , trying to really identify how is Twitter, how are other major platforms performing ahead of the midterms. And what we found was that Twitter is in the bottom half of major platforms in protecting users. This is the most basic protections Twitter has already failed to provide users. Since Musk came on, he has — his first move was to let go of some of the most senior executives: the head of safety, other CEO . He has taken actions then himself, as you say, to post and, I think, be a superspreader of conspiracy theory. When the assassination attempt on Nancy Pelosi occurred, he was so fast to goad his followers and others on the platform with citations to misleading information. He’s not an everyday person. He has a massive following. And so, to see someone like that, with such notability, and many people who feel he has credibility, be a superspreader of misinformation and conspiracy is deeply troubling. Then we saw him lay off almost 50% of his staff last week. And he did so with no fanfare, quite a bit of lackadaisical moving forward to the new era of Twitter that he wanted to usher in. And in letting these teams go, I just want to be really clear who were the people that he has let go. He has let go teams that are part of the human rights people, ethical AI, accessibility — that means the people that are helping to make disability users more friendly on the platform. He has let go of communications teams, integrity, safety. I mean, the teams just keep going. And so, they have been completely gutted. At this point they are flailing, and we are one day from the midterms. I don’t understand how someone who is the new CEO can, in one breath, say that he is committed to election integrity, committed, as Rashad said, all of the things that he promised when we met with Musk, and then turn around and take all of these actions. And so, we’ve really thought long and hard: How do we somehow catalyze accountability? How do we take some form of action to change things? And so, what we’ve done, across dozens of civil rights organizations, is come together. We’re now at over 60 civil rights organizations that have come together with grassroots and corporate support. We launched Stop Toxic Twitter. That’s a campaign where we are urging advertisers to halt their spending on Twitter. When we think about this, it’s really with the impetus knowing that we need a moral imperative here, where hopefully these advertisers begin to see that their brands are damaged when they occur and are seen next to troubling hate, toxic content, misleading information. And what we’ve seen, actually, now is a real groundswell of advertisers that are in fact pulling their ad spending from Twitter, whether it’s General Mills, General Motors, Pfizer, Audi, L’Oréal — there are many others now that have followed suit. And there’s sort of a domino effect here, where not only we have our corporate pressure, but there is that grassroots swell of support to say this is a place that, while toxic before, has become only more toxic since Musk took over, and something has to change. AMY GOODMAN : On Saturday — oh, let me say one thing. You have these H-1B workers, hundreds of them, who now fear deportation because they’ve lost their jobs. Another — on Saturday, former Twitter CEO Jeff Dorsey apologized for the layoffs in a series of tweets. He wrote, quote, “I own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation: I grew the company size too quickly. I apologize for that.” Several days after the 2020 presidential elections, Dorsey testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee about his view on the responsibility to its users. JEFF DORSEY : We are required to help increase the health of the public conversation, while at the same time ensuring that as many people as possible can participate. And in order to do so, we need to make policies so that people feel safe and they feel free to express themselves, to minimize threats of abuse, of harassment, of misleading information, of organized campaigns to artificially amplify or influence a particular conversation. And that policy creation, that enforcement is challenging, but also it is more or less opaque to the public. And that’s where I think we have a gap. We have transparency around our policies. We do not have transparency around how we operate content moderation, the rationale behind it, the reasoning. AMY GOODMAN : There’s a bigger question here, Nora Benavidez, and that is: Should these corporations be regulating themselves? I mean, this is the current town square for everyone. NORA BENAVIDEZ : These companies are so large and, frankly, so unchecked in the power that they bring. One of the reasons that we’ve been trying to gather civil and human rights and other civil society groups together is to demand better of these companies. Left to themselves, we have seen that they simply don’t care. There is a very long track record of inaction, and sometimes even a refusal to acknowledge the role these companies play in fomenting violence in the real world. We went to the very brink on January 6th last year. Our democracy barely held on. And as we’ve already spoken about with the assassination attempt on Nancy Pelosi, we know that the perpetrator of that also was incited and inspired by rhetoric online. There is a very real and porous relationship between the online world and this offline real world. And yet these companies, over and over again, will turn their back, whether that is in testimony before Congress, whether it is in their own very bland statements about what they are doing with the elections this year. They often act as if they are doing enough, and in doing enough, they are eager to protect democracy, to protect users. And what we have found is that it’s quite the opposite. These companies are failing to do even the most basic things for people. They are failing to make sure that their own backend systems and machine learning are not amplifying the worst content. We know that they are black boxes, so opaque that their transparency efforts are really the most meager steps towards some kind of lip service. And so, we look at what is now the days ahead, both tomorrow the midterms and then the kind of rhetoric that we know will follow in the days after tomorrow. We know that we are going to see hate, conspiracy, lies continue to proliferate. And yet these companies, every election cycle, kind of string together their election integrity efforts, saying that they are doing enough, and yet we often then find evidence later that not only did they not commit to doing certain things, but that even their promises have been hollow. That’s really why we’ve been trying to pursue a much wider type of initiative, building across sectors, whether that is with our advertiser partners, with other human rights leaders and activists, building what is a large movement here. AMY GOODMAN : I want to go to that issue of the advertisers. Rashad Robinson, Musk tweeted, “Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists,” he said. “Extremely messed up! They’re trying to destroy free speech in America.” Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, can you respond? RASHAD ROBINSON : Well, Musk has actually met with some of the advertisers, met with coalitions that represent the advertisers, has had a number of conversations over the last couple of weeks with advertisers, with ad agencies, as well. And Musk has not done himself any, any services. These companies are looking at where they want to put their brands. They are looking at the stability of Elon Musk and of the company. They were given some of the same promises we, as activists, were given around content moderation, around the election cycle, about making sure their ads are not placed up against white nationalists or disinformation. And Musk has not made good on the promises he’s made to them. And so, while we’ve been pressuring and pushing, I’ve never had such an experience — and I’ve run a lot of these campaigns — where advertisers are very clear that they’re not getting what they need, and we don’t have to do the type of pushing. I will say, just to pick up of what Nora was saying, is self-regulated companies are unregulated companies. And while we are doing this advertiser campaign, while we are pushing from the outside, the technology that has so much potential to move us into the future is dragging us into the past. And that is not unfortunate like a car accident. That is unjust, in its manufacture through a whole set of choices that our government has made about how companies are regulated. Make no mistake: Our cars are not safe because of the benevolence of the auto industry. They are safe because of the infrastructure and accountability that surrounds it, because there are people that evaluate and hold accountable. And right now, whether it’s the sort of algorithms that are not transparent, whether it’s the business models, decisions, whether it’s these companies getting to decide what the standard is in terms of moderation, in terms of accountability, whether it’s the fact that — AMY GOODMAN : We have 10 seconds. RASHAD ROBINSON : — because of laws that exist, they have a level of immunity to liability. We need a new set of engagement from Congress and the White House, because we can’t keep going to billionaires, begging them to protect our civil rights. AMY GOODMAN : Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, Nora Benavidez with Free Press, we thank you both for being with us. A happy belated birthday to John Hamilton! I’m Amy Goodman. Thanks so much for joining us.
Musk seems to be applying Twitter’s anti-impersonation policy only to accounts that criticize him, one reporter said. On Sunday, Twitter suspended the account of comedian Kathy Griffin hours after she changed her name (though not her user handle) to parody the company’s new CEO, billionaire Elon Musk. The company hasn’t officially clarified why Griffin was suspended from the site or whether the action will be permanent — but Musk appeared to allude to the comedian’s suspension in a tweet later that day. “Going forward, any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying ‘parody’ will be permanently suspended,” Musk wrote in his tweet . In subsequent tweets, Musk claimed that such restrictions were necessary with the rollout of Twitter Blue, his plan to allow any user to purchase a blue “verified” checkmark for $8. There “will be no warning” in the future to accounts that engage in parody like Griffin’s, Musk said , adding that , “Any name change at all will cause temporary loss of verified checkmark.” Twitter has always disallowed impersonating other users on the site to mock them or to make it seem like they’re saying something they’re not. But actions against Griffin and others seem to be personal — and hypocritical — for Musk, as the billionaire has repeatedly promised the site would be aligned with his “free speech absolutist” mentality under his direction. It appears that Musk is primarily enforcing the anti-impersonation policy against accounts that are critical of him , according to NBC News reporter Ben Collins. After buying Twitter, Musk declared that “comedy is now legal on Twitter.” But it seems as though parodies of Musk are off-limits, reporters have noted. Parody is a form of comedy in which a person engages in the fictional portrayal of a person or entity. It is often used for social criticism, and has been acknowledged by the Supreme Court as a protected form of free speech since the late 1980s . Referencing a free speech case that is currently before the High Court, The Onion , a satirical news publication, noted that satire is an effective form of social criticism — and that, by requiring publications to announce that they are parodies, the art form loses its punch. “For parody to work, it has to plausibly mimic the original,” The Onion stated in its brief to the Court.
The lawsuit alleges that Elon Musk was in violation of a federal law requiring advance notice of mass layoffs. Twitter employees have filed a class-action lawsuit against the company over CEO Elon Musk’s recently-announced plan to lay off half of the staff, or about 3,700 workers, with little to no notice. The lawsuit was filed in San Francisco federal court on Thursday by five current or former employees , who say that the company was in violation of a federal law, known as the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, that requires employers to give workers advance notice of 60 days before carrying out mass layoffs. Workers had already begun receiving notice that they were fired on Thursday — the same day that workers received notice of the layoffs in a company-wide email . The email informed employees that, on Friday, those who were keeping their jobs would be notified via their company emails, while those who were laid off would be notified through their personal emails. This is likely because, on Thursday night, workers reported losing access to their company emails and logins. The lawsuit seeks a court order forcing Twitter to obey the WARN Act. “We filed this lawsuit tonight in an attempt to make sure that employees are aware that they should not sign away their rights and that they have an avenue for pursuing their rights,” Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney who filed the lawsuit, told Bloomberg . Liss-Riordan has also sued Tesla over a similar circumstance in which Musk laid off about 10 percent of its staff. “We will now see if he is going to continue to thumb his nose at the laws of this country that protect employees,” Liss-Riordan said. “It appears that he’s repeating the same playbook of what he did at Tesla.” Rumors of layoffs had begun circulating this week among Twitter employees. One employee created a program that would help coworkers hold onto important documents and emails, The New York Times reported, and was later fired . Musk also made a sweeping change to employee benefits this week by removing the company’s monthly days off, known as “days of rest,” from their calendars. If Musk’s layoffs are found to be in violation of the WARN Act, it wouldn’t be the first time he’s been in violation of federal labor laws. Tesla has been the subject of multiple lawsuits by workers who say that the company’s California warehouse is a site of constant harassment for Black and female workers, who say they face horrific racism and sexual harassment, respectively, at work. Meanwhile, media experts have raised concerns over Musks’s plans for Twitter, especially in regard to his plans to unleash a deluge of posts from racists , anti-semites, and other members with far right ideologies onto the platform with little to no oversight, in the supposed name of free speech. The First Amendment right to free speech does not apply to private companies in this way, as private companies can moderate speech on their platforms, but Musk and the right seem to have no regard for that fact . Musk also fired top executives at Twitter earlier this week “for cause,” seemingly in an attempt to avoid paying out severance packages — but this move may also backfire on Musk, as the executives are considering their legal options to receive compensation.
Polling shows most Americans support the social media bans imposed on Trump. Earlier this week, Twitter owner Elon Musk suggested that it’s a matter of when — not if — former President Donald Trump’s account gets reinstated on the social media platform. Musk announced that he had met with civil rights leaders on Wednesday to discuss their concerns about the site becoming a platform where bigotry, bullying and violent rhetoric runs rampant, stating that anyone who is currently suspended from the site will not be allowed back right away. “Twitter will not allow anyone who was de-platformed for violating Twitter rules back on platform until we have a clear process for doing so, which will take at least a few more weeks,” Musk said in a tweet on Tuesday . Musk has also promised users that Twitter would not become “a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences” under his direction. His statements suggest, however, that those suspended from the site for encouraging violence will have their accounts reinstated at some point, including Trump. Indeed, when Musk first floated purchasing the site earlier this year, he said that Trump’s account should be reinstated. “I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump. I think that was a mistake,” Musk said this past spring , claiming the move was “foolish in the extreme,” and that it “alienated a large part of the country.” Polling has shown that most Americans support banning Trump from social media platforms. The initial decision to ban Trump from Twitter was made because the site believed his incendiary rhetoric could promote violent action among his followers. “After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” the site said one week after the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump loyalists. In a Politico /Morning Consult poll published in May, 53 percent of respondents said Twitter made the right decision in banning Trump , while only 37 percent disagreed. Musk’s decision to reinstate Trump could mean that Trump may soon find himself back on other major social media sites from which he was previously banned. In January 2023, Facebook’s two-year ban on Trump will come to an end . At that point, the company will not automatically restore his account — instead, it will ask experts “whether the risk to public safety has receded” and if returning Trump to the platform is an acceptable move to make.
“You’re a union buster with an ego problem who pockets the change from underpaying and mistreating people,” she wrote. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) hit back at Twitter CEO Elon Musk on the website on Wednesday after Musk, perhaps bothered by comments Ocasio-Cortez made earlier that week, attempted to criticize her in a tweet. Musk tweeted a screenshot of Ocasio-Cortez’s merchandise website, showing a campaign sweatshirt on sale for $58, with the price circled in an attempt to criticize the lawmaker for selling merchandise at that price point. “Proud of this and always will be,” Ocasio-Cortez shot back . “My workers are union, make a living wage, have full healthcare, and aren’t subject to racist treatment in their workplaces . Items are made in USA . Team AOC honors and respects working people. You should try it sometime instead of union-busting.” She added that the proceeds from her shop go toward her team’s community organizing efforts. She also directly replied to Musk’s tweet, saying, “You’re a union buster with an ego problem who pockets the change from underpaying and mistreating people.” After those tweets, she noted that her Twitter account appeared to stop working properly and she was “conveniently” unable to view mentions and notifications correctly. “I was informed via text that I seem to have gotten under a certain billionaire’s skin,” she wrote. “Just a reminder that money will never buy your way out of insecurity, folks.” Yo @elonmusk while I have your attention, why should people pay $8 just for their app to get bricked when they say something you don’t like? This is what my app has looked like ever since my tweet upset you yesterday. What’s good? Doesn’t seem very free speechy to me 🤔 pic.twitter.com/e3hcZ7T9up — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) November 3, 2022 Musk has indeed gotten in legal trouble with labor officials for anti-union statements in recent years, and Musk’s Tesla is currently the largest U.S.-based car manufacturer without a union. Meanwhile, perhaps not coincidentally, Tesla is notorious for its poor working standards . Tesla is a uniquely unsafe place to work; in 2019, Forbes found that Tesla’s plant in Fremont, California, had three times more federal safety violations in the previous four years than that of the top 10 U.S. factories combined. Tesla’s work environment also appears to be incredibly abusive. In a lawsuit filed earlier this year by the state of California, the state alleged that Black workers in the Tesla factory constantly hear racial slurs and that the factory floor is racially segregated, with Black workers relegated to areas that other workers call heinous, racist names like “the slave ship” or “porch monkey stations.” The company was also sued last year by a woman who worked at the plant. She said she was the subject of constant sexual harassment at work, where she alleges coworkers would catcall her and aggressively touch her body multiple times a week. With the working conditions at Tesla in mind, Twitter users noted the irony that Tesla appears to sell apparel at an even higher price than Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign store. A sweatshirt from Tesla’s merchandise shop , similar to the Ocasio-Cortez sweatshirt Musk had tweeted about, costs $75. It’s unclear where the apparel on Tesla’s site is made. The attack on Ocasio-Cortez appears to have been triggered by tweets she made earlier this week criticizing Musk for his plans to overhaul the website , including charging $8 a month for verification on the platform — a proposal that has been met with widespread criticism. “One guy’s business plan for a $44 billion over-leveraged purchase is apparently to run around and individually ask people for $8,” she said in a tweet on Wednesday. “Remember that next time you question yourself or your qualifications.”
The groups warned that the advertisers could be aiding right-wing extremism if they don’t pull funding. Dozens of justice and watchdog groups are urging top Twitter advertisers to use their influence over the website to urge new CEO Elon Musk to embrace content moderation or threaten to pull their funding if he doesn’t. In a letter to 20 top advertisers , 40 groups warn that, while Musk has promised advertisers he won’t turn the website into a “free-for-all hellscape,” his actions have indicated otherwise. The letter was signed by groups like Media Matters for America, Public Citizen, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the National Center for Transgender Equality, and others. They say that Musk’s promises to advertisers “in no way accurately portray his plans for Twitter,” and that if he carries out even a fraction of what he has pledged for supposed “free speech” on the platform, “then Twitter will not and can not be a safe platform for brands.” “Within 24 hours of Musk taking ownership, the platform was inundated with hate and disinformation . Not only are extremists celebrating Musk’s takeover of Twitter, they are seeing it as a new opportunity to post the most abusive, harassing, and racist language and imagery,” the letter reads. “This includes clear threats of violence against people with whom they disagree.” Indeed, hateful tweets flooded the platform just hours after Musk’s takeover, as right-wing users feel they can freely tweet slurs, attack LGBTQ people and glorify Nazism with Musk in charge. Meanwhile, in one of his first posts on Twitter after obtaining the company, Musk tweeted a false right-wing conspiracy theory about the attack on Paul Pelosi, amplifying it to an even wider audience. “Without deliberate efforts by Twitter to address this type of abuse and hate, your brands will be actively supporting accelerating extremism,” the groups wrote. Musk, who calls himself a “ free speech absolutist ,” has already taken steps to overhaul content moderation on the platform — which, while flawed , has worked in removing abusive and misleading content in the past. Since obtaining the company, Musk has fired Twitter’s top content moderation chief, and the team that oversees content has reportedly been blocked from accessing their moderation tools, rendering them unable to penalize accounts that violate Twitter’s hate speech policies. As social media websites have learned over and over again throughout the years, content moderation is key to attracting advertisers; typically, advertisers don’t like seeing their promoted content sandwiched between hateful posts and racist slurs. At the same time, advertising makes up a vast majority of Twitter’s revenue — so advertisers can have massive influence over how the website is run, if they so choose. The groups urge the advertisers to use this power to “notify Musk and publicly commit that you will cease all advertising on Twitter globally if he follows through on his plans to undermine brand safety and community standards including gutting content moderation.” “Elon Musk has consistently failed to comprehend that freedom of speech does not mean freedom to abuse and that online spaces should be safe for women, people of color, the LGBTQ+ community and other marginalized groups,” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, one of the letter signatories, said in a statement . In recent days, Musk has proposed making users pay for verification on the platform, floating plans to charge $20 a month for the blue checkmark and then later $8 after the initial idea was met with widespread backlash. He has postured as though the idea is a tool to equalize the platform; in reality, however, it’s likely aimed at creating an alternative profit stream, though it’s questionable as to how much money this would actually bring in. Ironically, he has also promised that paid users would get search and reply priority, which means that their posts would be shown more than those of unpaid users — a move that would only further solidify the disparities between users who can afford to pay about $100 a year for the service and users who cannot. The plan was widely mocked by Twitter users. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York) expressed scorn for the idea, laughing “at a billionaire earnestly trying to sell people on the idea that ‘free speech’ is actually a $8/mo subscription plan,” she wrote on the website on Tuesday .
Musk shared a conspiracy theory about the attack from a well-known fake news site. Twitter’s new owner, billionaire Elon Musk, amplified a false conspiracy theory on Twitter on Sunday about the violent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-California) husband. Later on, he deleted the tweet containing the disinformation and tried to downplay his actions by joking about reports on what had transpired. Musk was replying to a tweet from former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who condemned the attack and disparaged Republicans for using violent rhetoric online and in person. Paul Pelosi’s assailant, who fractured his skull with a hammer in the encounter in the Pelosis’ home, has shared far right conspiracy theories on social media, and reportedly asked “Where’s Nancy?” several times during the incident. In his response to Clinton’s tweet, Musk published a blatantly false conspiracy theory that claimed the assailant — identified as 42-year-old David DePape — was having an affair with Paul Pelosi, and that the attack was related to their supposed relationship, not far right conspiracy theories and violent rhetoric from the GOP. “There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye,” Musk said in his reply to Clinton , sharing a link to the story from a website called The Santa Monica Observer . The site is a known publisher of fake news articles — content that is completely made up with the sole purpose of misleading and enraging those who believe it to be true. The website Media Bias/Fact Check , which catalogues such sites, describes The Santa Monica Observer as being a “questionable” source because of its “routine publication of false and misleading information and the use of poor sources.” The site has, for example, published articles falsely asserting that Hillary Clinton actually died on 9/11 , and pushed the false claim that a mass shooter in Texas in 2017 had converted to Islam prior to his attack. Hours after facing widespread backlash for sharing the fake news article, Musk’s tweet was deleted, although who deleted the tweet is unknown. Several legitimate news sites noted that Musk’s actions could indicate that disinformation will be allowed to run rampant on the platform under the billionaire’s direction. Musk previously promised that any changes to Twitter would be minute. Last week, upon acquiring the company, Musk vowed that the platform wouldn’t “become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences.” “Doesn’t Musk know that the world is watching to see how responsible he is, as the new owner of Twitter?” former Labor Secretary Robert Reich wrote in an op-ed for The Guardian . “The fact that he personally posts such unhinged, dangerous drivel within three days of taking over the platform suggests he doesn’t give a damn.” In response to the backlash, Musk shared an image of a New York Times headline that read , “Elon Musk, in a Tweet, Shares Link From Site Known to Publish False News.” “This is fake – I did *not* tweet out a link to The New York Times!” Musk joked . This is fake – I did *not* tweet out a link to The New York Times! pic.twitter.com/d6V6m5ATW2 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 31, 2022 Many previously active Twitter users have left the site due to Musk’s purchase of Twitter, and his latest actions may lead more people to delete their accounts. False claims involving politicians have the potential to result in violence; DePape, for instance, apparently bought into several anti-Democratic Party conspiracy theories prior to his attack at the Pelosis’ residence. Another recent example is former President Donald Trump’s errant claims of election fraud in the 2020 presidential contest, which led to hundreds of his loyalists attacking the U.S. Capitol building in January 2021 .
The richest man on the planet is now in control of one of the most widely used social media platforms. Tesla CEO Elon Musk completed his $44 billion purchase of Twitter on Thursday after a chaotic, months-long buyout process, leaving the richest man on the planet in control of one of the world’s most widely used social media and communication platforms. Musk wasted no time imposing himself on the company, swiftly firing several top executives including CEO Parag Agrawal. “The bird is freed,” Musk tweeted late Thursday. A self-described free speech absolutist who has proven in practice to be anything but , Musk has yet to fully detail his vision for Twitter, but critics of the takeover fear that the billionaire’s suggestions thus far — including reversing the permanent bans of former President Donald Trump and potentially other figures such as the hate-spewing conspiracy monger Alex Jones — could further deluge the platform with disinformation ahead of key elections in the United States and Brazil. As The New York Times observed , “Twitter said it would prohibit misleading claims about voting and the outcome of elections, but that was before Mr. Musk owned it.” “Elon Musk’s plans for Twitter will make it an even more hate-filled cesspool, leading to irreparable real-world harm,” said the Stop the Deal Coalition, an alliance of groups that includes Accountable Tech, Friends of the Earth, Public Citizen, and the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. The coalition has urged Congress to investigate Musk’s acquisition of Twitter. (The purchase is reportedly already facing an investigation by federal regulators.) “Musk’s plans will leave the platform more vulnerable to security threats, rampant disinformation, and extremism just ahead of the midterm elections,” the coalition said. “Elon Musk has a thirst for chaos and utter disregard for anyone other than himself and should not own Twitter.” The coalition noted that, to fund the Twitter purchase, Musk is “accepting financing from Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud and the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar — two countries run by repressive regimes.” Saudi Arabia and Qatar are hardly bastions of free speech: Earlier this month, the Saudis sentenced 72-year-old U.S. citizen Saad Ibrahim Almadi to 16 years in prison over tweets criticizing the regime. Almadi’s son told The Washington Post that the kingdom has tortured his father in prison. “Elon Musk owning one of the world’s most powerful communication platforms is dangerous for us all,” the Stop the Deal Coalition continued. “As Musk runs Twitter to the ground, let this serve as a warning to other platforms that they will be held accountable for ignoring public safety and dismantling the guardrails designed to protect our information ecosystem.” Elon Musk is an erratic billionaire who has promised to rollback critical safeguards, replatform users who have repeatedly incited violence, and provide a megaphone to extremists who traffic in disinformation. And he has just been given carte blanche control over this platform. — Nicole Gill (@nicolelgill) October 28, 2022 In a statement posted to Twitter Thursday morning, Musk said the reason he purchased the company “is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence.” But Musk’s stated openness to free expression appears not to apply to his employees, Tesla customers, or journalists covering his companies. “In November 2020, former Tesla employee Stephen Henkes said he was fired from his job at Tesla on August 3, 2020 after raising safety concerns internally then filing formal complaints with government offices, when the company failed to fix and communicate accurately with customers over what he said were unacceptable fire risks in the company’s solar installations,” CNBC reported Thursday. “Musk and Tesla have also sought — not always successfully — to silence customers,” the outlet added. “For example, Tesla used to compel customers to sign agreements containing non-disclosure clauses as a prerequisite to have their vehicles repaired,” the outlet added. “In 2021, Tesla asked customers to agree not to post critically to social media about FSD Beta, an experimental driver assistance software package that some Tesla owners could test out using their own cars and unpaid time to do so.” “Musk is the face of 21st-century tech-based, extreme capitalism.” Musk, like other billionaire CEOs, is also a union-buster. Last year, the National Labor Relations Board upheld a judge’s ruling that Tesla unlawfully fired an employee involved in union organizing. The labor board also affirmed the finding that Musk illegally threatened workers “with the loss of their stock options” if they decided to form a union. David Nasaw, emeritus professor of history at the CUNY Graduate Center, wrote in a column for the Times on Thursday that “Musk is the face of 21st-century tech-based, extreme capitalism, just as the robber barons, who built our railroads, and Andrew Carnegie, who supplied those railroads and the builders of modern American cities with steel, embodied the exuberant and expansive industrial capitalism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.” “Mr. Musk has exploited the opportunities emerging in a rapidly disintegrating regulatory state apparatus and acquired a small army of investors and a fleet of lobbyists, lawyers, and fanboys (known as Musketeers),” Nasaw continued. “He has sought to position himself as a tech genius who can break the rules, exploit and excise those who work for him, ridicule those who stand in his way, and do as he wishes with his wealth because it benefits humanity.” “It is not unreasonable to expect that a Musk-owned and controlled Twitter will, in the name of free speech, allow disinformation and misinformation to be tweeted ad infinitum so long as it discredits his political opponents and celebrates and enriches himself and his allies,” Nasaw added. “Elon Musk is a product of his — and our — times. Rather than debate or deride his influence, we must recognize that he is not the self-made genius businessman he plays in the media. Instead, his success was prompted and paid for by taxpayer money and abetted by government officials who have allowed him and other billionaire businessmen to exercise more and more control over our economy and our politics.”
In 2017, Tesla banned workers from wearing pro-union shirts as workers waged a union drive at its California warehouse. Tesla violated federal labor laws when it banned workers from wearing shirts with union insignia at its California warehouse as workers waged a union drive in recent years, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled on Monday. In 2017 , Tesla banned its workers from wearing shirts with logos other than Tesla’s after workers began wearing shirts displaying a small United Auto Workers (UAW) logo, which the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Unions (AFL-CIO) said were designed specifically to meet the company’s dress code. Though it is unlawful for employers to bar employees from wearing union insignia at work, a NLRB ruling in a 2019 case involving Walmart established that employers could do so in special circumstances. Monday’s 3-2 decision overruled that case , affirming that interfering in any way with a worker’s right to wear union insignia is “presumptively unlawful” and that Tesla had failed to establish a special circumstance justifying its ban. “Wearing union insignia, whether a button or a t-shirt, is a critical form of protected communication,” NLRB Chair Lauren McFerran said in a statement. “For many decades, employees have used insignia to advocate for their workplace interests — from supporting organizing campaigns, to protesting unfair conditions in the workplace — and the law has always protected them.” Though the ruling overruled the Walmart case, the precedent established by that case is still in place; in other words, there are still special circumstances in which the NLRB may allow employers to restrict workers from wearing union insignia. Walmart had argued , for instance, that union employees in customer-facing positions needed to maintain a professional appearance and that union insignia may distract from the shopping experience. McFerran had dissented from the Republican-majority opinion in 2019, arguing that it not only ignored NLRB precedent but also Supreme Court precedent establishing workers’ rights to wear union insignia. The UAW, which was involved in the dispute against Tesla, praised Monday’s decision. “This a great victory for workers who have the courage to join together and organize in a system that is currently stacked heavily in favor of employers like Tesla who have no qualms about violating the law,” UAW Vice President Cindy Estrada said in a statement . “While we celebrate the justice in today’s ruling by an increasingly pro-worker NLRB, it also nevertheless highlights the substantial flaws in U.S. labor law,” Estrada went on. “Here is a company that clearly took numerous aggressive and unlawful steps to block workers’ rights, and yet it is more than four years down the road before workers see a modicum of justice.” Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk have broken federal labor laws several times in quashing workers’ attempts to form a union. Last year, the board found that Tesla had unlawfully fired a pro-union worker and illegally threatened and interrogated pro-union workers. The board also previously ordered the deletion of a 2018 tweet from Musk discouraging his workers from unionizing, reiterating an order from a judge who ruled that the tweet was illegal in 2019. “Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted,” Musk had written. “But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.” Despite the order, the tweet has not been deleted .
The key ways in which the ultrawealthy avoid taxes are largely unavailable to most taxpayers. Last June, drawing on the largest trove of confidential American tax data that’s ever been obtained, ProPublica launched a series of stories documenting the key ways the ultrawealthy avoid taxes, strategies that are largely unavailable to most taxpayers. To mark the first anniversary of the launch, we decided to assemble a quick summary of the techniques — all of which can generate tax savings on a massive scale — revealed in the series. Our first story unraveled how billionaires like Elon Musk, Warren Buffett and Jeff Bezos were able to amass some of the largest fortunes in history while paying remarkably little tax relative to their immense wealth. They did it in part by avoiding selling off their vast holdings of stock. The U.S. system taxes income. Selling stock generates income, so they avoid income as the system defines it. Meanwhile, billionaires can tap into their wealth by borrowing against it. And borrowing isn’t taxable. (Buffett said he followed the law and preferred that his wealth go to charity; the others didn’t comment beyond a “?” from Musk.) Other billionaires used less conventional ways to avoid income, we found. Tech mogul Peter Thiel amassed a $5 billion Roth IRA , a type of account that shields income from taxes and is intended to help low- and middle-class savers prepare for retirement. Back in 1999, Thiel stuffed low-valued shares of the company that would become PayPal into the account, a maneuver tax lawyers said risked running afoul of IRS rules. (It’s not clear if the government ever challenged the move.) He set himself up to reap billions in untaxed gains. (Thiel did not respond to questions for the original article.) Even when tech billionaires do show income on their tax return, they tend to pay relatively low income tax rates . That’s because of the type of income they have: Gains from long-term investments, such as from stock sales, are taxed at a lower rate. But what do you do if you’re making over $1 billion every year, and it’s largely from short-term trading? Do you just accept that you’ll pay the higher rate on all that income? A s we reported t his week , Jeff Yass, head of one of the most profitable firms on Wall Street, did not meekly accept this fate. Instead, his firm, Susquehanna International Group, found creative ways to transform the wrong sort of income into the right kind, generating tax savings that exceeded $1 billion over just six years. (Susquehanna declined to comment but in a court case that centered on similar allegations, it maintained that it complies with the law.) The tax code offers business owners a slew of methods to erase income through deductions, none more awesome than buying a sports team , as former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer did with the Los Angeles Clippers. It doesn’t matter whether the team is actually profitable and growing in value. It can still be a write-off. (In some cases, we found, owners could effectively deduct a given player’s contract not once, but twice. They’re allowed to take deductions comparable to those for factory equipment that loses value as it ages, even as teams almost inevitably gain in value.) That’s one reason owners tend to pay far lower tax rates than the athletes they employ, or even the people serving beer in the team’s stadium. In our story, we found a Clippers arena worker who made $45,000 a year and paid a higher tax rate than the billionaire Ballmer. (Ballmer said he pays the taxes he owes.) In certain industries, like real estate or oil and gas, the tax breaks are so plentiful that billionaires can erase their income entirely even as they grow richer . That’s how real estate developer Stephen Ross (who also happens to own the Miami Dolphins) went 10 years without paying any income tax. Ross said that he followed the law. Another mogul, this one in the oil business, managed to tap a near bottomless well of write-offs via one of the biggest oil spills in history . (The mogul’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.) Deductions from hobbies and side projects , which the ultrawealthy can structure as businesses, are another fun option. For some billionaires, it’s race horses: We found that six owners of thoroughbreds at the 2021 Kentucky Derby had taken a combined $600 million in tax write-offs on their horse racing operations. For others, like Beanie Babies founder Ty Warner, it’s luxury hotels. The billionaire splurged on a couple of landmark Four Seasons locations and then went 12 years without paying any income tax. (Representatives for Warner did not respond to requests for comment.) Sometimes, it pays to fight for a new tax break. For the billionaires who contributed millions to Republican politicians, the payoff came in the form of Trump’s “big, beautiful tax cut” for passthrough businesses . We found the change sent $1 billion in tax savings in a single year to just 82 ultrawealthy households. Some business owners also boosted their savings with a trick : They slashed their own salaries and categorized the money instead as passthrough income. With so many options to reduce taxes, the richest Americans often manage low income tax rates. We analyzed the incomes and taxes of the country’s top 400 earners , those averaging over $110 million in income per year. Overall, the group paid relatively low rates, but certain segments (tech billionaires, heirs, private equity executives) stood out even within this elite population because they were able to draw on the sorts of techniques detailed above. (Also drawing on these techniques were wealthy politicians, like the governors of Colorado and West Virginia .) But the real standouts were the billionaires who reported such low incomes that they qualified for government assistance. At least 18 billionaires received stimulus checks in 2020, because their tax returns placed them below the income cutoff ($150,000 for a married couple). The holes in the estate tax, we found, are even more remarkable. There are well-worn ways to make sure Uncle Sam doesn’t get his cut of a fortune being passed on to heirs, and the most common is through a trust. How common no one can say, but we found evidence that at least half of the nation’s 100 richest individuals had used estate-tax-dodging trusts . In another story, we followed three century-old dynasties down through the generations , showing how they used trusts to avoid taxes, so that a fortune could pass all the way from the original early 20th century tycoon to, for example, the great-great-granddaughter who recently collected $210 million before her 19th birthday.
Warren Buffett paid an effective tax rate of only 0.1 percent between 2013 and 2018, IRS documents show. A new analysis of leaked Internal Revenue Service (IRS) documents shows that some of the U.S.’s wealthiest people have paid a disproportionately low federal income tax rate in recent years. In an analysis released Thursday, Americans for Tax Fairness found that, in relation to their wealth, 26 of the nation’s richest billionaires paid an average effective federal income tax rate of just 4.8 percent between 2013 and 2018. Collectively, they paid just $24 billion in taxes — a miniscule amount compared to an immense growth of $500 billion in their wealth over those six years. The report demonstrates the vast disparities between the tax code for the rich and for regular Americans. Billionaires are able to dodge taxes on a large portion of their wealth due to tax laws allowing them to accrue wealth largely tax-free through investments and other sources. The taxes they did pay are on their relatively low taxable incomes — which Americans for Tax Fairness calculates in this case to be $132.2 billion, or only about a fourth of their wealth gain. By comparison, a Tax Foundation analysis found that, as a whole, Americans paid an average tax rate of 13.3 percent in 2018. “This revelation underscores the need to tax billionaires and other ultra-wealthy Americans more effectively, as proposed in plans from President Biden and Congressional Democrats,” according to the report. A handful of these billionaires paid an effective tax rate of about 2 percent or less, including some of the world’s richest people. Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, currently the world’s second and 15th richest people , respectively, paid an effective federal tax rate of 1.1 percent. Conservative bankrollers Charles and David Koch paid only 1.3 and 1.4 percent, respectively. The world’s fifth richest person, Warren Buffett, paid a diminutive 0.1 percent in income taxes. Elon Musk, now the world’s richest man , according to Forbes , paid a tax rate of only 2.1 percent between 2013 and 2018 — which may have set the stage for his wealth to increase exponentially over the following years. “As long as we fail to tax their main source of income — the growth in their fortunes — many billionaires will continue to live largely tax-free lives,” said Americans for Tax Fairness Executive Director Frank Clemente. “Teachers, plumbers, firefighters and other working Americans can already pay higher tax rates than billionaires — and that’s just counting the small part of billionaire income that is now taxed. When you include their untaxed wealth growth in the calculation, many billionaires pay almost nothing.” This is what a rigged and corrupt system looks like. Effective Tax Rate: 0.1%: Warren Buffett worth $111 billion 1.1%: Jeff Bezos worth $131 billion 1.8% Mike Bloomberg worth $82 billion 2.1%: Elon Musk worth $210 billion 13.5%: Registered Nurse Yes. It’s time to #TaxTheRich — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) May 19, 2022 Thursday’s report echoes previous findings that the richest Americans pay lower tax rates than the average American. Last year, a White House analysis estimated that the nation’s richest 400 families paid an income tax rate of just 8.2 percent over 2010 and 2018, largely because of the flexibility allowed to the wealthy in reporting their incomes and “preferred rates” for the types of taxes they pay, like taxes on stock sales. The wealthy often use incredibly complex ways to manage and store their wealth, making it difficult for IRS auditors to ensure that they’re taxed correctly. According to a Government Accountability Office report released Tuesday, a lack of IRS funding and complex audits of those with incomes of $200,000 and more are causing audits to go down overall , opening up avenues for the wealthy to dodge taxes even further. Some Democratic lawmakers have introduced measures to combat the growing wealth gap in the country; earlier this year, President Joe Biden requested in his 2023 budget proposal that Congress pass a “Billionaire Minimum Income Tax” of 20 percent to capture not only salaries but also unrealized gains from assets like stocks.
Trump was banned from the site for his incendiary rhetoric about election fraud after his loss in the 2020 election. On Tuesday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that he would allow former President Donald Trump to return to Twitter once his purchase of the social media site for nearly $44 billion is finalized. Trump was banned from Twitter shortly after a mob of his loyalists, incensed by his false claims of election fraud, attacked the U.S. Capitol building on January 6, 2021, to interrupt the certification of President Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election. Musk described the ban on Trump as “foolish in the extreme” at a car exposition event hosted by The Financial Times on Tuesday. “I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump. I think that was a mistake,” Musk said , adding that the company’s decision “alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice.” Twitter permanently suspended Trump’s account shortly after the attack on the Capitol due to the incendiary nature of his public statements. “After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” the company said less than a week after the attack occurred. In one of the last tweets Trump published before his account was suspended, he defended his loyalists’ actions and continued to push lies about the 2020 election being illegitimate. “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots,” Trump wrote on the evening of the Capitol attack . Trump has said that he won’t return to Twitter, opting instead to stick with his own social media site, Truth Social. But those close to the former president say that the temptation to return to his @realDonaldTrump handle on Twitter will be too difficult to overcome . Musk plans to make drastic changes to Twitter’s rules once he’s in charge; in his words, the site will become a “digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated” without restriction. Of course, in real town hall settings, there are rules of decorum that must be followed — and people can be banned if they continually incite violence or propagate disinformation. One recently published study suggests that Musk’s plans may decrease free speech on the platform. “Social media users have in past years become victims of manipulation by ‘astroturf’ causes, trolling and misinformation,” said head researcher of the study Filippo Menczer , professor of Informatics and Computer Science at Indiana University. “Abuse is facilitated by social bots and coordinated networks that create the appearance of human crowds.” He added: Musk’s likely acquisition of Twitter raises concerns that the social media platform could decrease its content moderation. This body of research shows that stronger, not weaker, moderation of the information ecosystem is called for to combat harmful misinformation. “The voices of real users would be drowned out by malicious users who manipulate Twitter through inauthentic accounts, bots and echo chambers” if Musk’s laissez-faire policies were enacted, Menczer said, noting that such policies “would ironically hurt free speech.”
Sources close to Trump say that he’ll probably return to Twitter, if the Tesla CEO allows him to do so. Devin Nunes, former Republican congressman from California and current CEO of Truth Social – Donald Trump’s social media site – said that the former president had spoken with Elon Musk about purchasing Twitter and had “encouraged” him to buy the company shortly before the Tesla CEO announced he was going to do so. Nunes, an avowed Trump supporter and disgraced member of Congress, was being interviewed this week on Fox Business when he alleged that Trump had given that advice to Musk earlier this year. “President Trump basically, before Elon Musk bought it, actually said to go and buy it,” Nunes said of Musk’s purchase of Twitter. Nunes further claimed that Musk, the world’s richest man (who has a history of censoring his own employees ), is someone who is “ on tech tyrants” and will expand supposed speech rights on the platform — a goal that Trump supports. “Donald Trump wanted to make sure the American people got their voice back, and the internet was open, and that is what we are doing,” Nunes said. “People like Elon Musk doing what he’s doing. We are definitely in favor of it.” Nunes suggested he wasn’t worried about Twitter upstaging Trump’s site. Truth Social, he claimed, is “very much different than Twitter, and that’s why we encouraged Elon Musk to buy it.” In reality, critics have lambasted Truth Social as being almost a carbon copy of Twitter . After reports Nunes’s claims broke, Musk denied having any communications with Trump regarding his pending purchase of Twitter. “This is false,” Musk said in a tweet on Friday , adding that he hasn’t spoken with Trump “directly or indirectly” about his buying the site. Trump was banned from Twitter over a year ago after a mob of his loyalists attacked the U.S. Capitol building and he continued to make incendiary posts calling for the 2020 presidential election to be overturned. The former president described the ban (and the booting of other users encouraging violence or violating the site’s terms of service) as going against his free speech rights, even though the site is a private company and can regulate how users interact with one another. The First Amendment states that a person’s speech rights cannot be restricted by the federal government. It does not prevent private companies from regulating speech in their own spaces. Many have speculated that Trump will return to Twitter after Musk’s $43 billion purchase of the site becomes official. Trump himself has claimed he won’t be coming back to the site , but because of the failure of Truth Social and the temptation to claim victory over the social media platform he once used daily, many of the former president’s own advisers are themselves skeptical of his claim that he won’t go back to tweeting. Trump “loved his Twitter. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise,” a Trump adviser said last month. Truth Social has been plagued with many problems — “bugs” have made it difficult at times to navigate the site, and there are huge sign-up delays to even use the platform. The site isn’t available on desktop, and Android users also cannot yet access Truth Social. The site also appears to go against the ethos that Trump purports it follows, as users have reported being banned after creating parody accounts that poke fun at Nunes. Indeed, Truth Social’s own terms of service says users may be kicked off the site “for any reason or for no reason.”
“Ultimately what all this boils down to is power. Who’s going to have the power in our country?” Senator Warren said. As Elon Musk shores up $44 billion to buy Twitter, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) is warning that the potential purchase could have major consequences for U.S. democracy. In an interview with MSNBC on Thursday , Warren said that Musk’s offer to buy Twitter, which Twitter agreed to earlier this week , makes the case that the country needs to “make two big changes” to its tax code and regulation of Big Tech. “The first one is we need a wealth tax in America. And let’s talk about how Elon’s purchase here was subsidized by tens of millions of people who’ve paid their taxes every year,” she said. “The second part is we need rules of the road for Big Tech.” Indeed, the only reason that Musk has the funds — or the financial leverage — to buy Twitter is because he has been allowed to accumulate an astounding amount of wealth over the course of the pandemic. In March of 2020, he was worth a little more than half of his $44 billion offer. Over the course of just two years, however, his wealth has skyrocketed by 1080 percent, largely tax-free. Warren went on to say that she believes the most alarming thing about Musk’s offer isn’t necessarily his right-wing politics , but the implications about who is allowed to make decisions surrounding a platform that millions of Americans use to communicate. “Ultimately what all this boils down to is power. Who’s going to have the power in our country?” she asked. “Are we going to make decisions as a democracy or is this going to be Elon Musk all by himself, off in a room, a bazillionaire, who just plays by his own set of rules? That’s really what’s at stake here,” she said, later adding that “it’s about one person making all of the decisions about how tens of millions of people will have an opportunity to communicate with each other.” Though lawmakers have passed some regulations on Big Tech in attempts to rein in corporations, Warren says that the industry still lacks a set of regulations that could help increase competition and allow for more user freedom. While phone calls can be made to any phone owner, regardless of what network they use, the millions of Twitter or other social media users are constrained to only being able to communicate with other users of the same platform, she said. “We need rules so that you can leave the Twitter platform and go to a competitor’s platform and still be able to reach each other. You have rules like that, then you actually have some competition,” she said. “Rules of the road could help facilitate that kind of competition and frankly break the stranglehold of someone like Elon Musk coming in and just owning the whole thing.” Unlike if Musk were to buy a company that produces soap or cars, Warren emphasized that buying Twitter is about buying influence and power. Earlier this week, Warren tweeted that even just the fact that this kind of purchase could go through without any stopgaps is an indication that the country needs stronger regulations. “One billionaire — whose estimated net worth has gotten about 10 times larger since the start of the pandemic — is about to have the power to decide how millions of people can communicate with each other,” she wrote . “It’s dangerous for our democracy to have so much power in so few hands.” Social media and political experts have also sounded the alarm about Musk’s potential purchase, noting that there is already a long list of billionaires who own major communication-related entities, like Jeff Bezos’s ownership of The Washington Post , for example. Musk claims to be a “ free speech absolutist ,” meaning in theory that users who regularly encourage bigoted harassment, violence, and otherwise would remain on the platform, as well as users who spread vast amounts of disinformation. Even just the news of his purchase appears to have driven tens of thousands of far right users to the platform. Unregulated internet forums are a breeding ground for fascists ; platforms like 4chan and 8chan, which prided themselves on having no content moderation, have been linked to hate crimes and mass murders.
Musk has been a bully on Twitter for years. Now he’ll control it. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is set to become the new owner of Twitter after the company’s board agreed to sell the influential social media platform for $44 billion on Monday. Musk, who describes himself as a “free speech absolutist,” tweeted, “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.” We speak with tech industry watchdog Jessica González and Evan “Rabble” Henshaw-Plath, who was part of the team that launched Twitter in 2006, about what the buyout means for the future of digital media and journalism. “Musk or no Musk, Twitter has work to do to ensure that it stops amplifying bigotry, calls to violence, hate speech and conspiracy theories,” says González. Henshaw-Plath says he senses Musk has “no idea what he’s getting into,” and discusses the activist roots of Twitter. This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is set to become the new owner of Twitter, after the company’s board agreed to sell the influential social media platform for $44 billion. The deal is expected to close later this year pending regulatory approval. The watchdog group Media Matters criticized Musk’s takeover of Twitter, saying it will be a, quote, “victory for disinformation and the people who peddle it.” Media Matters and other groups have expressed concern that Musk will allow Donald Trump to resume using the platform. Twitter permanently banned Trump shortly after the deadly January 6th insurrection. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich also criticized Musk’s move, saying, quote, “Unlike his ambitions to upend transportation and interstellar flight, this one is dangerous. It might well upend democracy,” Reich said. Musk, who describes himself as a “free speech absolutist,” tweeted, “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.” We’re joined now by two guests. Jessica González is with us, co- CEO of the media advocacy group Free Press. She’s also a founder of the Change the Terms coalition. And we’re joined by Evan Henshaw-Plath, a.k.a. Rabble. He was the first employee and lead engineer of the company that created Twitter. He’s now working on Bluesky, a Twitter-backed project to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. He’s the founder of Planetary, a decentralized social media app, also helped build the global Indymedia network. He’s joining us from Wellington, New Zealand. We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Well, Evan Henshaw-Plath, you have been described as Twitter’s first employee — well, at least the employee of the company that started Twitter. Can you respond now to the richest man in the world taking over one of the most powerful social media platforms in the world, that you helped start, Rabble? EVAN HENSHAW – PLATH : I mean, it’s a bit disturbing, because we don’t know what’s going to happen. We don’t know where he’s going to take it and what kind of decisions he’s going to make with it. Under the current administration of the company, we’ve had commitments to things like the moderation policies and follow the Santa Clara Principles for better behavior, and we can see where it goes. And Elon Musk has advocated for some things that are big and great, and some things that are really terrible and will harm it. And we simply don’t know anymore where he’s going to take it, but we do know that he has been a bit of an abusive crypto bro on Twitter. And is that the kind of person we want deciding how our public sphere is governed? JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And you mentioned this issue of cryptocurrency. There are some who believe that this is an attempt for him to be able to spread his support of cryptocurrency through an established worldwide structure. What’s your sense of the relationship between his support of cryptocurrencies and Twitter? EVAN HENSHAW – PLATH : We don’t know. He believes in open source. He believes in open protocols. That is what the Bluesky project has been working on. That’s what we’ve been working on with Planetary. But he also believes in — you know, that it should all be monetized. And in some ways, that’s not a huge change from Parag and Jack, the previous two CEOs, who are also pro-crypto and advocate for cryptocurrency. So, whether or not this means that cryptocurrencies are going to be more deeply integrated into Twitter, we just don’t know. He says he wants to do it, but the current Twitter management also has been exploring it. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Jessica González of Free Press, what are your concerns? You urged the shareholders of Twitter not to approve this takeover attempt. What are your main concerns about Elon Musk? JESSICA GONZÁLEZ: Good morning, Juan. My main concern is that Musk has demonstrated no commitment to helping to protect our democracy and civil and human rights. Musk or no Musk, Twitter has work to do to ensure that it stops amplifying bigotry, calls to violence, hate speech and conspiracy theories. It also needs to do much more to protect its users across geographies and across languages. So, while there may be a couple of things to like here around transparency, we’ve seen Musk demonstrate time and again that he doesn’t really have a commitment to protecting our democracy. His number one objective is to protect himself and to advance his own interests. So, when we hear Musk saying, “I’m a free speech absolutist. Everything goes,” that means also that hate and harassment goes, the kind hate and harassment that shouts down women and people of color. That’s not actually how we achieve the balance of free speech. Moreover, Musk has also really not lived up to his self-proclaimed free speech absolutist values. In fact, he called on the Chinese government to censor folks who were criticizing Tesla. So, this is not the sort of steady, reliable hand that we want making decisions about how our communications infrastructure works. AMY GOODMAN : Jessica, can you explain the Fix the Feed campaign that you are now involved with? You’ve just announced this campaign. JESSICA GONZÁLEZ: Why, yes, I’d love to. Thank you, Amy. So, I am working with over five dozen partners in the Change the Terms coalition. This is a coalition that was built by and serving women and people of color, who are more likely to face hate and harassment campaigns online. Ahead of the midterms, we are calling on not just Twitter but also TikTok, YouTube, Meta and other social media platforms to stop amplifying conspiracy theories, election interference and disinformation that is targeted at women, people of color and others on the margins. We’re calling on them to do that across languages. We’ve seen time and again that social media, as poorly as they’re moderating content in English, it’s even worse in Spanish and other non-English languages. And we’re calling on them to be much more transparent about their content moderation practices. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Evan, I wanted to ask you: This whole issue of the responsibility of these platforms for content moderation versus the imperative to protect free speech, how do you feel that a Musk-led Twitter will resolve this issue? Because, clearly, there are major, major problems. There’s government attempts now to hold the platforms responsible for their content, and threats of more legislation in that vein. What’s your sense of how Musk will deal with this? EVAN HENSHAW – PLATH : My sense is that Musk actually has no idea what he’s getting into. He has no idea of the complexity of it. And he sees just a few examples of it, and so he says, “Ban the box, and verify real names,” without understanding the harm that will do and the fact that it doesn’t improve the quality of conversation. He doesn’t know the perspective of people who are marginalized, because, you know, he’s the son of a man who owned an emerald mine in South Africa. He hasn’t experienced what people who experience systemic attacks on these platforms face. And so, yes, he’s been — lots of critics and everything else, but what he doesn’t realize is that these moderation systems and these moderation problems, they make mistakes. It’s hard. There’s a process by which it needs to be improved. But simply removing moderation, that doesn’t help the problem. That’s actually going to make the entire space much more toxic. And we’ll see whether or not he even actually wants to do that, given the fact that when it’s criticizing him, he has no problem silencing speech. AMY GOODMAN : Rabble, I wanted to ask you about the early roots of Twitter. Let’s go back to 2004, if you would say TXTMob was an early root of Twitter, helping to organize the protests against the Republican National Convention that were taking place here in New York City, also used during the Democratic convention of that year in Boston. Can you go back then and then just give us a trajectory of what Twitter came out of? EVAN HENSHAW – PLATH : Sure. So, the company that created Twitter was originally a podcasting company called Odeo. And a bunch of us who had been active as media activists within Indymedia and in collaboration with Democracy Now! had built a text alert system called TXTMob. Groups of people could text either news or updates to each other in the streets in the protests. And so, that was very successful in 2004 for the protests, and we used it again for the May 1st immigrant rights general strike. And because we were building that and working at it out of the office, the rest of the Odeo team got excited about it, and we taught Jack Dorsey how to send SMSes. And the entire team spent a week using TXTMob and then did an analysis of what worked and didn’t work in that system. And that and looking at blogging and looking at status update systems that people had played with were sort of combined together to create Twitter. And so, the activist roots behind Twitter were very much part of it. The entire team that created Twitter spent an entire week just using the activist platforms to understand how they work, and then did a design analysis of how to make them better. And that political vision and that energy is part of why Twitter is such an effective organizing tool. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, and has it disheartened you to see what has happened in the years since, the fact that now celebrities can basically buy Twitter followers or that bots can have such enormous influence on people’s thinking of what’s real and not, given the fact that the entire business model came out of a resistance and a pro-democracy movement? EVAN HENSHAW – PLATH : You know, there are parts of it that I am incredibly proud of and stunned by — the way in which Black Lives Matter has used it for organizing, the way in which people in the Arab Spring used it to communicate their movement to the outside world — and there’s things that are completely depressing. You know, sort of the byline for Indymedia was that you should be the media. And at the time, that seemed like a radical statement. Now that we have people being their own media, we see that there’s a whole ‘nother set of problems that we need to face. And it didn’t change who people were, although we have used it to change the world. Unfortunately, it empowered a bunch of people who had views that were right-wing, authoritarian, racist, homophobic views that had been silenced by the mainstream media, a whole bunch of conspiracy theories. And if we give everybody a microphone, we need better tools to counteract that. AMY GOODMAN : So, let me ask Jessica González about President Trump, who was famously thrown off Twitter after the January 6th insurrection. He has said he has no plans to rejoin Twitter. But your thoughts on that? And just overall, Musk saying that — he has used the platform to say that shelter-in-place orders because of COVID were fascist. He also once tweeted that the coronavirus panic is dumb. Does this make you concerned about — there’s nothing wrong with saying those things if he has those opinions, but this whole issue that Media Matters and others are raising of going down a path of misinformation that has massive effect around the world? JESSICA GONZÁLEZ: Yes, I’m concerned, Amy. Listen, individuals have the right to say whatever they want, right? But when you combine that with power, money, presence, that’s something we ought to be concerned about. Can Musk take over Twitter and do what he wants with it? Sure, he can. But he shouldn’t. And it could be very dangerous for our democracy. The fact that he has regularly spread COVID disinformation is extremely concerning. In my opinion, Twitter has a responsibility to protect public health and safety. And if the person running Twitter is a regular purveyor of false information, that gives me great pause. As for Donald Trump, I don’t trust for a minute that he wouldn’t jump right back on Twitter if he could. I think Twitter made the right decision to take him down. He was inciting violence. He was using the platform to amplify conspiracy theories and bigotry. That was the right move. I don’t think he should return to Twitter. We saw study after study, after he was taken down, that disinformation went down markedly after he left the platform. So, I hope that he will remain off Twitter. And that’s yet to be known. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I wanted to ask you, Jessica, just quickly, if you could — Joe Biden nominated Gigi Sohn to fill the fifth and tie-breaking seat at the Federal Communications Commission in October, but she hasn’t been confirmed by the Senate. What is your sense of what’s going on there? JESSICA GONZÁLEZ: Well, Gigi has been targeted by a right-wing smear campaign, plain and simple. They’ve been drumming up false information about Gigi, painting her in a really cruel light. I know Gigi personally. She’s a good friend of mine. She’s a responsible steward of the public interest, and I hope the Senate will confirm her without further delay. This is really slowing down our ability to pass important policies to get people online, to ensure the internet is affordable, and to reinstate net neutrality principles. AMY GOODMAN : And, Evan, what do you make of Elon Musk’s statement that he would like to make Twitter’s algorithm open source? EVAN HENSHAW – PLATH : I’m an advocate of open source. I think that opening up the algorithm, so that outside people can analyze how it works and understand it, will be powerful for users and powerful for researchers. The fact that it’s been a black box has been a major problem. Whether or not that really improves things is a good question, because part of the reason companies don’t publish their algorithms for their timelines and for who they connect to is that opens up people to game the system even more effectively. And so, the minute you know exactly how it works, you’ll tweak the way in which you publish stuff to do that. And normal users, who aren’t trying to manipulate the system, won’t be able to see that and won’t be able to take advantage of the loopholes, whereas people who have intentional teams set up to figure out how to manipulate these things, either for advertising or disinformation, they’re going to be able to use that information about the algorithm to more effectively dominate the platform. And that’s a major problem and something that we need to address. One thing, when Trump was elected, I actually sat down with Jack Dorsey, and we had a conversation about deleting the account in 2016. And my answer, what I said to him, was, “You should have deleted the account before he ran for president, when he was doing abusive things there.” If you did it after that, the stock market and investors were going to claim that he was not following fiduciary responsibility, and so the market was going to overwrite him if he deleted it. And that’s why I think he had to wait until it got too bad, ’til the insurrection. And that’s the problem with running public spaces on the market. AMY GOODMAN : Finally, Evan, is it accurate to say you were the first employee of Twitter? EVAN HENSHAW – PLATH : Yeah, I was the first employee of Odeo and involved with creating Twitter. Twitter, the company, was actually created about a year after Twitter, the service, was launched. AMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you both for being with us, Evan Henshaw-Plath, a.k.a. Rabble, founding member of Twitter, and Jessica González, co- CEO of Free Press, founder of the Change the Terms coalition. Coming up next, we go to Steven Donziger. He has just been freed from house arrest after almost 1,000 days. Back in 30 seconds.
The former president says he’s not interested in coming back, but insiders say the allure will be too strong for him. Insiders within both of the two major U.S. political parties have expressed concern that billionaire Elon Musk’s recent purchase of Twitter could potentially result in former President Donald Trump being allowed back on the platform. Trump was banned from the site more than a year ago for spewing incendiary rhetoric regarding the attack on the U.S. Capitol building by a mob of his loyalists on January 6, 2021. Although Musk has not yet stated whether he would lift Trump’s ban from the site, comments he made after his $44 billion purchase of Twitter on Monday seem to indicate that he will move in that direction. Musk has described himself as an “absolutist” of free speech principles , despite having a documented history of censoring his workers for expressing pro-union sentiments. He recently said in a statement that “Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.” Both Democrats and Republicans are worried that Musk’s purchase of the site could mean Trump’s return. According to reporting from CNBC , officials in the Biden White House are “closely watching the deal,” and fear that Trump’s potential Twitter comeback might result in an increase in disinformation, as the former president frequently used the platform to promote lies back when he was allowed on the site. “Trump will use Twitter to do far more damage to regain power in 2022 and 2024 while Elon Musk has given no indication that he will do anything to stop him,” Mary Anne Marsh, a veteran Democratic strategist, said to CNBC . Republicans appear to be similarly concerned about the possibility of Trump returning to Twitter. According to a report from Politico , “no one is more petrified” about the potential return of the former president to the platform “than members of Trump’s own party.” In a series of calls Politico reporters made on Monday night to Republican insiders, not a single one spoke positively about the possibility that Trump would be allowed to return to the platform.”Every single one of them told us that they hoped the former president stays the hell away from Twitter,” the news agency reported. Republican strategists are worried that if Trump returned to the site, it could hurt the GOP’s chances to flip control of either house of Congress in this year’s midterm races. While most prognosticators have predicted that Republicans will win , some polls have indicated that the race for Congress will be tight , not the slam dunk that some Republicans have said it will be. Allowing Trump to resume his erratic tweeting would not work to their advantage, Republicans have said. “If I’m a Democrat, I’d pray that Elon Musk puts Trump right back on Twitter,” one GOP House leadership aide told Politico . A Trump return to the site is “enough to create headaches — and it’s enough to probably cost us a couple seats,” that aide added. Trump has claimed that he won’t return to Twitter , as he is instead focused on promoting his own social media site, Truth Social. “I want everybody to come over to TRUTH — conservatives, liberals, whatever,” Trump said in a Fox News interview this week. But because Trump’s site has failed miserably since its opening earlier this year — and because he filed a lawsuit against Twitter last fall seeking to have his account reinstated — most are guessing Trump will attempt to return to Twitter at some point. Trump “loved his Twitter. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise,” an adviser close to Trump said . “The lure of Twitter … may prove as irresistible for Trump,” GOP strategist Doug Heye said to Politico , adding that there’s “no faster way for Trump to be front and center the political conversation than rejoining Twitter, and he knows that.”
Musk’s net worth has shot up a whopping 1,080 percent during the pandemic. As nearly a million Americans died of COVID during the pandemic, Elon Musk’s wealth skyrocketed — opening the door for him to be able to make offers like buying Twitter for $43 billion, as he did on Thursday. As Americans for Tax Fairness documented on Thursday , Musk’s wealth has shot up by a whopping 1,080 percent during the pandemic. On March 18, 2020, Musk was worth an already towering $24.6 billion; now, he’s worth $290 billion. In other words, he has gained over $265 billion in two years, the vast majority of which he accumulated tax-free. This is an absurd amount of money, unfathomable likely even to the Tesla and SpaceX owner himself. His current net worth is roughly 1.2 percent of the entire U.S. gross domestic product of $24 trillion . This is more money than a single person could spend in a lifetime — unless they wanted to buy Twitter, one of the world’s most heavily visited websites, at far over its current valuation nearly 7 times over. Indeed, Musk took a step toward buying Twitter on Thursday at $54.20 a share, higher than its current share price of roughly $45.50. This would bring the total to $43 billion, which Musk called his “best and final offer.” Though the pandemic was ruinous for millions of Americans and the world, it was a huge boon to Musk, now the richest man on Earth. If he wanted to buy Twitter before the pandemic at this price, he would have had to sell all of his assets — and even then, he would have come up short by about $18.4 billion. “Workers pay tax on their income all year, every year. Simple justice demands that billionaires do the same,” Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, said in a statement provided to Truthout . “Instead, our current system allows billionaires like Musk to accumulate vast amounts of wealth without ever contributing a fair share into the tax system like working families do.” BREAKING: America’s billionaires have officially gotten $2 TRILLION richer during the pandemic, largely tax-free Elon Musk’s wealth alone shot up by 1,080% Workers struggling to afford gas, groceries, healthcare are paying their fair share this Tax Day. Billionaires should too. pic.twitter.com/LxjlezphpM — Americans For Tax Fairness (@4TaxFairness) April 14, 2022 Last week, Musk bought a 9 percent stake in Twitter, making him the largest shareholder in the company. The company offered to make him a board member, contingent on a background check, but he refused . In his filing this week, he said that simply being a board member wouldn’t have given him enough power over the company. “I don’t have confidence in management,” he said, citing the website’s “potential.” It’s unclear what Musk wants to change about the site, but he has a reputation for firing Tesla employees who disagree with him. He and Tesla have also been disciplined by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) for illegally firing a union organizer and posting an anti-union tweet in 2018. He has also landed himself in legal hot water for his tweets; in 2018, he tweeted that he was considering making the company private , a “joke” that earned him a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a $20 million fine. Stocks are often rocked after Musk tweets about his financial moves; last year, for instance, he tweeted a poll about whether or not to sell 10 percent of his stock in Tesla, causing shares to tumble. In 2020, for no apparent reason, he tweeted that Tesla share prices were “ too high ,” also causing the price to drop. Media experts have raised concerns about the consequences for Twitter and the internet if Musk buys the website. Despite his history of censoring his workers, Musk recently described himself as a “ free speech absolutist ” after saying that he refused to block Russian news sources from accessing SpaceX’s satellite communication system, Starlink; it’s unclear how these principles would extend to Twitter. “Regardless of Musk’s dubious principles, any move to relax content moderation standards warrants legitimate concern,” wrote University of Pennsylvania media policy professor Victor Pickard for The Nation . “For example, changing the policies by which Twitter restricts or suspends accounts that cause social harm could yield more harassment, hate speech, incitement to violence, and dangerous misinformation about voting and vaccines.” “Twitter’s uneven adherence to its own rules has been rightly criticized, but having no rules would be a troll’s paradise,” Pickard continued, “a Hobbesian hellscape of all against all, with the most vulnerable having the most to lose.” Musk currently also faces a series of scandals related to his businesses and finances. When he made his huge Twitter stock buy, he filed the disclosure 11 days late, netting him an extra $156 million. The SEC requires people to publicly announce when they have reached a 5 percent stake in a company, which Musk appeared to have reached on March 14. But he kept buying stock at about $39 per share until he reached 9.2 percent in secret; then, after his announcement, shares rose about 30 percent to above $50 a share. Investors have sued over Musk’s late disclosure, saying that they may have missed out on gains because of this move. Musk’s companies are also facing scrutiny from three separate government agencies, including over allegations that management at Tesla’s manufacturing plant in California have segregated the shop floor by race, and that Black employees suffer rampant racism. One worker reported hearing racial slurs as often as 50 to 100 times a day, and seeing slurs written as graffiti in the bathroom at work.
The so-called “Billionaire’s Tax” would specifically target approximately 700 of the nation’s wealthiest people. Economic experts and progressives opposed to the outrageous levels of inequality in the United States celebrated Saturday evening and into Sunday after reporting revealed that President Joe Biden plans to unveil “a 20 percent minimum tax rate on all American households worth more than $100 million” — a so-called “Billionaire’s Tax” that will specifically target approximately 700 of the nation’s wealthiest people. First reported by the Washington Post ’s Jeff Stein, citing multiple people familiar with the matter and an internal White House document, the proposal could be announced as early as Monday, part of the president’s rollout of his 2023 budget. According to the Post : Many billionaires can pay far lower tax rates than average Americans because the federal government does not tax the increase in the value of their stock holdings until those assets are sold. Billionaires are able to borrow against their accumulated gains without triggering taxes on capital gains, enabling huge accumulations of wealth to go virtually untaxed by the federal government. The White House Office of Management and Budget and Council of Economic Advisers estimated this fall that 400 billionaire families paid an average federal tax rate of just over 8 percent of their income between 2010 and 2018. That rate is lower than the rate paid by millions of Americans. The White House plan would mandate billionaires to pay a tax rate of at least 20 percent on their full income, or the combination of traditional forms of wage income and whatever they may have made in unrealized gains, such as higher stock prices. Gabriel Zucman, associated professor of economics at U.C. Berkeley and an expert on inequality and taxation, said the Biden plan could have real teeth. “This is big!” Zucman tweeted late Saturday in response to the reporting on the plan. “With this tax, the top 10 billionaires alone would pay at least $215 billion in the next 10 years.” Currently, the five richest U.S. billionaires are Elon Musk of Tesla, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett, and Google co-founder Larry Page. “How big of a change would this make?” Zucman continued. “According to ProPublica , Bezos, Buffett, and Musk collectively paid $1.5 billion in federal income tax in the 5 years 2014-2018.” But under the Biden proposal, he said, “they would pay at least $111 billion (almost 100x more) over the next 9 years.” The increase would be especially profound, given how little these ultra-wealthy individuals currently pay. The White House document on the proposal, according to the Post , states: “The Billionaire Minimum Income Tax will ensure that the very wealthiest Americans pay a tax rate of at least 20 percent on their full income. This minimum tax would make sure that the wealthiest Americans no longer pay a tax rate lower than teachers and firefighters.” Harvard economics professor Jason Furman called the plan a “landmark proposal” from Biden. “A minimum tax that also applies to unrealized gains — as a prepayment against future capital gains,” he said, would be a substantive improvement for the nation’s tax system, one that “should get serious consideration as a fair and efficient way to raise significant revenue.” The nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which has documented the various ways by which current tax code favors the rich over working people, said the proposal — which comes at a time in which “ billionaire wealth grew by $1.7 trillion during the pandemic ” — would be a great improvement over the status quo. The nation’s tax system allows billionaires to: 1. grow their wealth and pay no tax 2. pass wealth to their heirs and pay no tax 3. borrow against their wealth to avoid tax. A billionaire’s tax could address tax flaws that enable wealth concentration at the tippy top. — ITEP (@iteptweets) March 27, 2022 Americans For Tax Fairness, a campaign coalition of more than 400 national and local organizations that advocates for a more fair tax system, also welcomed the news. “Right now in America,” the group said Saturday, “704 billionaires own more wealth than 65 million households. We can build an economy that works for the rest of us, but we need billionaires to pay their fair share. It’s time for a #BillionairesTax.”
Analysis from Americans for Tax Fairness shows billionaires are 57 percent richer now than they were in March 2020. American billionaires have accumulated an enormous amount of wealth during the pandemic as the rest of the public has suffered due to an unstable economy, a new analysis shows. In an analysis released last week, Americans for Tax Fairness found that billionaires have accumulated $1.7 trillion in wealth during the last two years alone, meaning that they are now 57 percent richer than they were in March of 2020. U.S. billionaires are now worth a collective $4.6 trillion, and the amount of wealth that they’ve hoarded over the past two years alone could have paid for nearly the entire Build Back Better Act. There are also more billionaires in the U.S. than at the beginning of the pandemic, according to the analysis of Forbes data. In March of 2020, there were 614 billionaires; there are now 704, marking an increase of 15 percent. The 15 richest billionaires in the country have contributed hugely to billionaires’ cumulative wealth gain. The top billionaires each gained at least $10 billion during the pandemic, with people like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates gaining over $52 billion and $31 billion, respectively. Some billionaires more than doubled their wealth, like Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Elon Musk saw the highest gains of the top 15 billionaires, both in proportion to his previous wealth and in sheer dollar amounts. In March of 2020, Musk was worth an already towering $24.6 billion. Over the pandemic, he added a whopping $209.4 billion to his wealth, bringing his net worth to $234 billion. This is a gain of 851 percent. Meanwhile, in 2020 and in 2021, wages and salaries for workers only increased by 2.6 percent and 4.5 percent respectively. Together, billionaires hold more than the bottom 50 percent of the American public — made up of 65 million households — who own $3.4 trillion total. It’s likely that none of these wealth gains will ever be taxed, the report found. Without regulations to rein in billionaire wealth, this gap continues to get worse; a RAND corporation report from 2020 found that the bottom 90 percent of the public would have $50 trillion more in 2018 if income growth had stayed as equitable as it was in the 1970s. Some Democrats proposed a billionaires income tax to be included in the Build Back Better Act last year, but such measures faced opposition from conservative Democrats in the Senate. Still, the report advocates for the implementation of a billionaires income tax, which would capture a portion of billionaires’ investment incomes, which are not taxed. Measures like a wealth tax could also help stem the explosive and inequitable growth of billionaires’ wealth. Polling has found that the concept of taxing billionaires is popular with voters from across the political spectrum. The pandemic has especially accelerated billionaires’ wealth gains; Amazon’s profits grew precipitously early in the pandemic and have only continued growing since, with sales growing 22 percent last year over 2020. While Bezos reaps the gains from that revenue growth, his company fiercely union busts and places severe quotas on its workers while, in some cases, not paying them enough to afford rent . “For billionaires, it’s been two years of raking in the riches, while for most families it’s been two years of fear, frustration and financial worry,” said Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness. “Working families pay what they owe in taxes each paycheck. Billionaires generally pay little or nothing in taxes on these extraordinary gains in wealth,” Clemente continued. “Congress should enact a Billionaires Income Tax to directly tax these wealth gains as income each year, so that billionaires begin to pay their fair share of taxes.”
The $900 billion company claims that most of its billions of dollars in profits came from overseas. Tesla will likely owe $0 in federal income taxes this year, despite reporting billions of dollars of profits to its shareholders for 2021, according to recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings . As first reported by CNN , Tesla has said that its U.S. operations lost $130 million pre-taxes – meaning that the company will likely be able to avoid paying federal income taxes on its record profits of $5.5 billion that it reported to shareholders for 2021. The company, which is valued at over $900 billion , claimed that its profits came from overseas, even though 45 percent of its revenue last year came from sales in the U.S. It’s unclear whether the vast majority of the company’s profits actually came from overseas, as the company reported. Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), says that Tesla is too young and hasn’t turned a profit for long enough to be able to tell whether or not the company is structured in a way that enables it to exploit offshore tax loopholes , as many corporations do. However, parts of the company’s structure – like its three subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands – are “a definite eyebrow raiser from a tax avoidance perspective,” Gardner told Truthout . “It suggests to me that the company might be trying to shift its income offshore.” It’s possible that the reason why the company is claiming that overseas profits are much more of a boon than U.S. profits is because it’s true; the company did indeed make a large portion of its profits from China last year. But Tesla could also be making this claim falsely because it gives the company the ability to shift those profits overseas, where they may be subject to lower tax rates. “That’s a completely plausible alternative reason why they’d say, ‘we’ll never turn a profit in the U.S.’” Gardner said. “But the quiet part of that statement – ‘we’ll never turn a profit in the U.S.’ – is ‘because we know we’re always going to shift our profits somewhere else.’” Purposefully structuring its finances and corporation in this way would make Tesla’s filings similar to that of the “dozens of other companies that I’ve seen making similar disclosures with a similarly suspicious allocation of income between the US and every other nation,” Gardner said. However, Gardner also emphasized that there’s no way to know whether Tesla is doing this for sure without getting further confirmation from its tax filings or other details. Exploiting overseas tax loopholes in order to dodge taxes is an incredibly common practice among U.S. corporations. According to a 2014 report, the U.S. loses out on $90 billion a year in income taxes as a result of these loopholes. Progressive lawmakers say that the fact that a corporate giant like Tesla can avoid paying federal taxes domestically is a reason to reform the U.S. tax code. “Tesla and other giant corporations have long used scams and loopholes to help them get out of paying taxes — that has to stop,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) told CNN . “Democrats are working to end Republican tax cuts for corporations shifting profits and jobs overseas.” Tesla joins a number of other huge corporations that will be able to dodge taxes this year despite posting sky-high profits. In a report published last week, Gardner wrote that Amazon will only pay an effective tax rate of 6.1 percent for 2021, essentially dodging $5.2 billion in federal income taxes. Tesla’s filings come as the company is facing a lawsuit filed by the state of California . The state alleges that workers at the company’s California manufacturing plant face rampant racism at work.
One Black employee reported hearing racial slurs at work 50 to 100 times a day, the lawsuit says. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing is suing auto manufacturer Tesla in light of reports from Black employees at the company’s California manufacturing plant that they have faced rampant racism at work. According to the lawsuit , Tesla has segregated the manufacturing floor, relegating Black workers to areas that employees call “porch monkey stations,” “the slave ship,” and “the plantation.” Black workers are continually denied promotions and training, and are the only workers who have had to do work like scrubbing floors on their hands and knees, the suit says. Fellow workers often hurl racial slurs at Black employees, and managers say the n-word constantly, the lawsuit claims. At least one worker has reported hearing racial slurs as often as 50 to 100 times a day , according to the filing. Even in the bathroom, Black workers face racism, the lawsuit alleges. Racist graffiti like “hang ,” “all monkeys work outside,” swastikas and KKK symbols have been carved into the walls, where they allegedly remained for months before the company finally cleaned them up. “These numerous complaints by Black and/or African American workers about racial harassment, racial discrimination, and retaliation lodged over a span of almost a decade have been futile,” the lawsuit reads. “Tesla has continued to deflect and evade responsibility. While it claims to not tolerate racial harassment or discrimination at its factories, Tesla’s investigations of complaints are not compliant with law.” The agency’s director, Kevin Kish, told the Los Angeles Times that this is the largest racial discrimination lawsuit ever brought by the state. The agency has been investigating the company for three years. The company has responded to the lawsuit by saying that the allegations happened only over the course of a few years and that the agency has investigated and dismissed discrimination cases at the company before – a claim that the agency has denied . Tesla has also said that it plans on requesting a pause in the case. The agency said in its lawsuit that the discrimination started as early as 2012, only a year after the plant opened, and still continues today. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is allegedly aware of these issues, but has been dismissive of them. In an email sent to workers in 2017, The New York Times found that Musk warned workers against “being a huge jerk” to “less represented” workers, but emphasized that the workers facing abuse should be forgiving. “f someone is a jerk to you, but sincerely apologizes, it is important to be thick-skinned and accept that apology,” Musk reportedly wrote. None of the company’s executives are Black, according to the lawsuit. Instead, while Black people are overrepresented in the company’s contracted workforce, they are “severely under-represented” as managers, senior officials and other higher paying, more influential roles. When workers speak up about facing racism and harassment, they are often subject to “retaliatory harassment, undesirable assignments, and/or termination, especially since human resource personnel charged with addressing the complaints were allegedly close to the harassers,” according to the lawsuit. An anonymous Tesla worker told More Perfect Union last year that they faced repeated harassment from a coworker, who announced in front of a production line of 50 workers that she was going to beat them up in the parking lot; later on, the human resources department told the worker that they were at fault for the incident. The department didn’t investigate the alleged harassment, the worker said – and when the department asked the majority-white witnesses what had happened, white employees sided with the alleged harasser.
The bill was incurred by transactions made over the past months in which he’s sold about $16 billion in stock so far. Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, recently bragged about receiving an historic $11 billion tax bill this year, but the tax obligation is only due to large, complicated stock sales over the past months, which he will almost certainly end up profiting from. Earlier this month, Musk boasted on Twitter that he will owe the most taxes of any individual in a single year (though he is also among the richest people in history). But when the conditions surrounding Musk’s tax bill are detailed, his true intentions become clearer. In 2012, as part of his compensation as CEO of Tesla, Musk received the option to make future stock purchases at their 2012 value, regardless of their market value at the time of purchase. This allowed Musk, who doesn’t receive a traditional salary from Tesla, to purchase millions of shares in November, setting off a cascade of similar transactions over the next weeks. Early in November, he bought those shares for $13.4 million, despite being valued at $2.3 billion. The option to buy these shares at this price is set to expire next year. And the Build Back Better Act, if it were eventually passed, could levy further taxes on the transaction if he were to put it off until 2022, making the trade strategically timed. Since then, Musk has made other similar transactions, which are taxed as income. At that tax bracket, they are subject to a 40.8 percent tax rate . These transactions are what make up the bulk of his $11 billion tax bill, according to tax experts. He won’t have to reach too far into his bank account to pay these taxes; Musk also sold millions of stock shares in order to help cover the tax liability and has thus far sold about $16 billion worth of stock that could go towards covering taxes, though it’s unclear to what extent. On top of these sales, Musk is set to receive even more in compensation from the company this year depending on its end-of-year performance. The hundred-billionaire’s tax bill, thus, is a product of a maneuver to further pad his towering $280 billion net worth . It is only about 3.9 percent of his net worth, which may increase due to further stock transactions. It is also only a fraction of the record $36 billion he made in one day in October. Unless Musk continues to make further large stock transactions in the coming years, it’s also likely to be an outlier for him. Though media outlets are gushing about the tax bill and publishing unqualified headlines on the matter, Musk typically makes these moves to avoid paying taxes, which would explain why he’s bragging about this year’s bill. Leaked tax documents obtained by ProPublica earlier this year found that Musk paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2018. Between 2014 and 2018, Musk’s “true” federal income tax rate was a mere 3.3 percent – lower than the average middle-income family’s tax rate each year. By the end of 2018, the 25 richest Americans were worth $1.1 trillion, as much as the combined wealth of 14.3M ordinary wage earners. The 2018 personal federal tax bill for the 25 richest: $1.9 billion. The bill for the wage earners: $143 billion. — ProPublica (@propublica) December 29, 2021
Musk’s net worth of over $288 billion is over 1 percent of the U.S. GDP of $22.7 trillion. This week, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, who has an estimated net worth of $288.6 billion , voiced his opposition to Democrats’ billionaire tax — while simultaneously breaking the record for wealth an individual has accumulated in one day. Democrats unveiled a proposal this week that would levy a tax on billionaires’ investment incomes in order to capture some of billionaires’ wealth, rather than just their reported incomes. Under this plan, Musk — who infamously paid $0 in income taxes in 2018 — would pay an estimated $10 billion a year over the next five years, according to an estimate by economist Gabriel Zucman. Though $10 billion is an unfathomably large amount of money for any individual to own, it is just a small fraction of Musk’s exorbitant wealth — which adds up to approximately 1.3 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product and is more than the value of international oil giant ExxonMobil. By contrast, the median worker in the U.S. makes $1.7 million over a lifetime, meaning that it would take the average worker just under 6,000 lifetimes to make the amount that Musk may get taxed from his investment income in a year. Furthermore, Musk gained enough money on Monday to cover the next three and a half years of his share of the billionaire tax, with over a billion dollars to spare. A massive Tesla order that caused a boost to the company’s shares pushed Musk’s fortune up by a whopping $36.2 billion , breaking the record for the most wealth someone has accumulated in a single day. For context, $36.2 billion is 10 percent of the amount that the Democrats’ Build Back Better Act would cost in a year — and Musk made it in one day. In other words, the billionaire tax would be entirely trivial to someone with such an incomprehensibly massive amount of wealth. Still, that hasn’t stopped him from complaining about the tax. “Exactly,” he said in response to a tweet about writing to representatives to oppose the billionaire tax. Musk then falsely implied that imposing such a tax is a slippery slope to taxing people with less wealth: “Eventually, they run out of other people’s money and then they come for you.” This conservative talking point is patently untrue: the billionaire tax has nothing to do with taxes on millionaires and even less to do with taxes on the middle and lower classes, which Democrats are staunchly opposed to raising. It doesn’t even raise taxes on the wealthy, which maxes out at 37 percent for income slightly over $500,000 for individuals — a tax rate that Musk isn’t subject to because he reports a low-to-zero yearly income to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a well-known tax avoidance technique for the ultra-wealthy. Studies have found that decades of tax cuts for the wealthy have not resulted in the promised trickle-down effect and instead only allowed the rich to accumulate even more wealth while paying a lower effective tax rate . Later, Musk implied in a tweet that the task of allocating the country’s resources is best left up to private interests rather than the government, despite the fact that low tax rates for the rich and corporations have led to the current era of runaway wealth. “Who is best at capital allocation – government or entrepreneurs – is indeed what it comes down to,” Musk said in response to a tweet saying that he should be trusted with resource allocation, rather than the Treasury Department. “The tricksters will conflate capital allocation with consumption.” This position is especially ironic coming from Musk, who benefits greatly from government subsidies. In 2015, when his companies were a fraction of their current size, the Los Angeles Times reported that Tesla, SolarCity (which has now been absorbed by Tesla) and SpaceX had collected a total of $4.9 billion in aid from the government in the form of grants, incentives and tax breaks . At the time, Tesla and SpaceX were worth $25 billion and $12 billion , respectively, meaning that the government subsidies contributed significantly to the businesses. Six years later, with the help of the government, Tesla is worth $1 trillion , and SpaceX $100 billion . Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), who crafted the billionaire tax this week, fired back at Musk on Tuesday. “The people who are clearly trying to be tricky are people who are trying to find a way to not pay taxes,” he said .
Over the last few decades, the wealthy have accumulated more wealth, as the middle class’s share of wealth has declined. New data from the Federal Reserve shows that the top 1 percent of wealthy individuals in the U.S. now have more wealth than the entire middle class combined. As of this summer, the middle 60 percent of American earners, which economists typically categorize as the middle class, now own only 26.6 percent of the national wealth, Bloomberg reported . Meanwhile, the top 1 percent control 27 percent of the nation’s collective wealth. This is the first time the richest Americans have had more wealth than the middle class since the Fed began recording such data in 1989. The past decades have seen growing accumulation of wealth for the richest Americans, coupled with steadily declining wealth for the middle class. In 1989, the top 1 percent controlled 17.2 percent of the nation’s wealth, whereas the middle 60 percent controlled 36.4 percent. The top 1 percent is made up of 1.3 million households making more than about $500,000 a year — a small fraction of the over 120 million households in the U.S. The 77.5 million middle class families make between about $27,000 and $141,000 a year. The middle 60 percent have seen declining shares in key financial areas like real estate and corporate equities over past decades. In 1991, the middle class owned 44.3 percent of real estate; they now own 38 percent. That same year, the middle 60 percent owned 21 percent of corporate equities, a number that has now plummeted to only 12 percent. The pandemic has only exacerbated these gaps. While middle and working class families have struggled over the past year and a half, kept afloat partially by Congress’s stimulus bills , billionaires continued to accumulate tremendous amounts of wealth. As of August, billionaires in the U.S. have gotten 62 percent richer during the pandemic, accumulating a whopping $1.8 trillion of wealth. This is nearly half of the entire wealth of the bottom 20 percent of earners in the U.S. — accumulated in just 18 months. Bloomberg notes that part of the reason for the rising wealth gap, especially within the past months, could be due to the inflated housing market, which has led to skyrocketing rents while boosting the wealth of property owners. The middle class also holds a growing portion of consumer debt. In order to stem the upwards flow of wealth, lawmakers and progressive advocates have been fighting for higher taxes on the wealthy. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) and other progressives have called for the implementation of a wealth tax , and Warren introduced a proposal earlier this year that would levy a 2 percent tax on wealth over $50 million and a 3 percent tax on wealth over $1 trillion. Progressive lawmakers have also called for levying enough taxes on the wealthiest Americans so that there are no billionaires left in the U.S. The top 1% now has more wealth than the entire middle class. Does that make sense to anyone? Yes. It’s time for Congress to take on the greed of the billionaires and deliver for the working class of this country. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) October 13, 2021 Meanwhile, Congress continues to uphold a tax code that often allows the country’s richest individuals to avoid paying taxes altogether. In 2007 and 2011, Jeff Bezos didn’t pay any federal income taxes, according to ProPublica . Bezos is the wealthiest man in the world, sometimes sharing the title with Elon Musk, who has also circumnavigated paying income taxes. Last month, the Treasury Department found that the top 1 percent of wealthiest people avoid paying more than $160 billion in taxes every year. “Today’s tax code contains two sets of rules,” the Treasury wrote in that report — one for the rich, and one for everyone else. Progressive lawmakers recently took steps to address systems that allow the tax code to become skewed toward the wealthy in the first place. Last week, Warren and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington) sent letters to top accounting firms in a probe into the revolving door between those firms and agencies like the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). “Americans are sick and tired of these corrupt schemes,” Warren and Jayapal wrote.
Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Larry Ellison pay almost no income tax. The collective wealth of the seven wealthiest Americans has now reached nearly $1 trillion. And these seven pay virtually nothing in income tax. According to Forbes , the collective wealth of these seven men — Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Larry Ellison — stood at $996 billion at the end of the day on August 25. That’s a group small enough to fit an SUV. Think about that. Just seven guys now control about $1 trillion in wealth — that’s about one-third the $3.5-trillion package now before Congress for desperately needed programs that range from dental and vision care for seniors to child tax credits for rescuing millions of families from poverty and measures that can save our burning planet from climate change. Some vilify that social spending as “unaffordable.” But it turns out that one third of the tab could be covered by the wealth of just 0.0000022 percent of the U.S. population — seven guys in one SUV. The still deeper connection between the wealth of our “trillion-dollar seven” and that $3.5-trillion in social spending: Whether that spending becomes reality likely will hinge on the votes of so-called political moderates who insist the programs must be “paid for.” Those same moderates will hold the deciding votes on the “pay fors” advocates for the social spending are proposing: increased taxes on the country’s enormously rich, including the trillion-dollar seven. And that gets us back to how we got into this mess in the first place. ProPublica recently exposed what many of us already suspected: Our trillion-dollar seven — and their fellow billionaires — barely pay any tax as a percentage of their true income. Between 2014 and 2018, America’s 25 top billionaires paid federal income tax during that five-year period equal to just 3.4 percent of the increase in their collective wealth over that same period. Can we change this dynamic? Yes, but to do so, those political moderates will need to agree to end the tax-avoidance strategy — “ Buy-Borrow-Die ” — that allows billionaires and the merely super-rich to escape tax on the enormous gains they realize on their investments. This scam works really quite simply. The wealthy buy an investment or — in the case of the trillion-dollar seven — found a company. Then, as their asset soars in value, they never sell. Instead, they borrow against the increased value of their asset whenever they need cash. Finally, they die, and each death wipes off the tax liability on all the gain that’s gone untaxed, sometimes for an entire adult lifetime. What makes the Buy-Borrow-Die strategy possible? The gaping loophole in our tax law known as “stepped-up basis.” Under this loophole, those who sell inherited assets get treated as if they had purchased the assets at their fair market value on the date of the deceased owner’s death. The end result: If Jeff Bezos’ children inherit his Amazon stock, about $200 billion in gains will face no tax at all. Our political leaders have been aware of the stepped-up basis loophole for decades, yet have done nothing while the super-rich have been using Buy-Borrow-Die to accumulate obscene piles of untaxed wealth. But the Biden administration is now calling on Congress to end stepped-up basis to fund the programs we need to move our country forward. Will our lawmakers now summon the courage to tax the trillion-dollar seven?
Jeff Bezos’s space company had lost a NASA contract, but Congress is poised to give the company $10 billion anyway. Last month , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA) chose Elon Musk’s space exploration company SpaceX for a $2.9 billion contract to help develop the agency’s moon landing project, Artemis. Now, Congress is debating an amendment to a science and research funding bill that would give $10 billion for the same project to Jeff Bezos’s space company, Blue Origin, which lost the original contract. The company has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on lobbying Congress. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Washington) proposed the amendment to the Endless Frontier Act that would essentially directly award billions to Blue Origin. The company is based in Cantwell’s home state and, The Intercept reports, spent $625,000 lobbying the Senate in the first three months of this year alone. At least $50,000 of that has gone directly toward lobbying efforts for the Artemis program. But there’s a chance that the amendment may not end up in the final bill. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) has offered a counterproposal without the $10 billion handout to Blue Origin. The purpose of the amendment, as he wrote in the amendment itself, is “ To eliminate the multi-billion dollar Bezos Bailout.” Sanders voiced concerns over the privatization of space exploration and giving billions to Bezos’s company on the Senate floor on Tuesday. “I worry very much that what we are seeing now is two of the wealthiest people in this country, Mr. Elon Musk and Mr. Bezos, deciding that they are going to take control over our space industry,” he said . “I have got a real problem with the authorization of $10 billion going to somebody who, among other things, is the wealthiest person in this country.” Sanders continued that criticism on Twitter on Wednesday morning. “Jeff Bezos is the richest guy on the planet. He’s gotten $86 billion richer since the start of the COVID pandemic,” he wrote . “Does he really need $10 billion from Congress for space exploration?” Indeed, space exploration has gotten increasingly privatized over the past decade or so, and former President Donald Trump even slashed NASA’s budget while voicing support for private commercial moon landers during his presidency. Cantwell has argued that her amendment is necessary for “ redundancy ,” saying “Trump had requested $3.4 billion for this, and then Congress never did anything about it.” She isn’t wrong about this — NASA was originally supposed to choose two companies so there could be a backup option if SpaceX couldn’t deliver. The agency only chose one company after Congress failed to provide enough funding for the project. However, that still doesn’t explain why the award, given to the company that wasn’t chosen for the project, would be so much larger than the original contract. Cantwell’s amendment, meanwhile, could actually slow down the moon landing project, writes Ars Technica . “In reality, Cantwell’s amendment is probably more accurately interpreted as an effort to support Blue Origin, which is based in the state she represents,” wrote Ars Technica ’s Eric Berger. “Were the Cantwell amendment to be signed into law, NASA would have to reopen the competition, thus delaying work on the agency’s return to the Moon and putting an already difficult target of 2024 into further jeopardy.” Blue Origin and Dynetics, the other company in competition for the contract, last month filed complaints with the Government Accountability Office over NASA’s decision. Cantwell’s amendment would essentially bypass those complaints, which are still open.
American billionaires’ collective wealth has grown by 55 percent to a whopping $4.56 trillion during the pandemic. The wealth of U.S. billionaires has grown tremendously during the pandemic, and the increase in their wealth alone could pay for a majority of President Joe Biden’s new infrastructure and jobs plan, finds a new report by Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF) and the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS). Between March of 2020 and now, the 719 U.S. billionaires’ collective wealth has grown by 55 percent, finds the report. Their combined wealth grew from $2.95 trillion to $4.56 trillion, a growth of $1.62 trillion. Just the increase in their wealth, the report says, could cover almost 70 percent of Biden’s new $2.25 trillion American Jobs Plan to create jobs and invest in infrastructure across the U.S. “Billionaire wealth growth has perversely accelerated over the 13 months of global pandemic. But the piling up of fortunes at the top has proceeded at a rapid clip for decades even as the net worth of working Americans lagged and public services deteriorated,” the report reads . “Tax reforms of the type proposed by President Biden would begin to reverse these damaging trends.” The wealth of people worth over $100 billion, who the report calls “centi-billionaires,” grew hand over fist during the pandemic. The report finds that Elon Musk’s wealth has increased, staggeringly, nearly sixfold during the pandemic to $172 billion; the wealth of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos grew by 74 percent during the last 13 months to total nearly $197 billion; and Mark Zuckerberg’s wealth more than doubled in a little over a year to $113.5 billion. Meanwhile, some of the CEOs who have profited the most from the pandemic treat their workers the worst. The Brookings Institute found that, of 13 major retail companies that have experienced pandemic windfalls, Amazon and Walmart are among the companies that compensate their workers the worst while forcing them to work through dangerous conditions as frontline workers. The Walton family, with more than half of Walmart’s shares, has also grown their wealth during the pandemic, the ATF and IPS report finds. Although the pandemic rapidly accelerated the growth of billionaires’ accumulated wealth, ATF and IPS write that this is a continuation of a trend that’s been ongoing for over 30 years. Since 1990, the report says, billionaires’ wealth has grown nineteenfold. Adjusting for inflation, billionaires have increased their wealth from $240 billion in 1990 to $4.56 trillion in 2021. More than a third of that came from the pandemic alone. Back in 1990, the bottom 50 percent of the U.S. had more collective wealth than billionaires, by a $140 billion margin, the report says. But, because of the continued accumulation of wealth at the top, U.S. billionaires now own over 4.5 times the amount of wealth as those who make up the bottom 50 percent of the economic scale, or roughly 165 million Americans. The wealth gap before the pandemic was already large and widening , but wealth inequality has also drastically increased during the course of just over a year. Lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) say that proposals like a wealth tax on the ultrarich could help to close some of these inequities while raising tax revenue. In his infrastructure bill, Biden has proposed a corporate tax increase from 21 to 28 percent. The Department of the Treasury says that the hike will raise more than enough money to cover the entire proposal . But a 28 percent corporate tax rate is still lower than what it was before then-President Donald Trump slashed it in 2017; under Barack Obama, the corporate tax rate was 35. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) has proposed raising the corporate tax rate back to pre-Trump rates as many Democrats and progressives have lambasted large corporations for paying zero dollars in federal income taxes . Meanwhile, progressives have said that wide support for the proposals in Biden’s infrastructure bill suggests that Biden can and should be more ambitious with the bill.
Sanders and Warren proposed a bill to raise taxes on corporations that pay CEOs 50 times what they pay average workers. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders invited both Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Jennifer Bates, one of Bezos’s employees, to a hearing on economic inequality on Wednesday, but only Bates agreed to show up and testify. Bates works at a massive Amazon fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, where she said the workday is “grueling.” “The shifts are long. The pace is super-fast,” Bates told the committee. “You are constantly being watched and monitored. They seem to think you are just another machine.” Bates and other workers will soon vote on whether to join the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union. Amazon has made headlines with an aggressive and costly campaign against the union push, forcing thousands of workers employed by the facility to attend multiple anti-union “education” meetings, according to Bates. “It’s frustrating that all we want is to make Amazon a better place to work,” Bates said. “Yet Amazon is acting like they are under attack. Maybe if they spent less time — and money — trying to stop the union they would hear what we are saying.” Sanders said Bezos is worth $182 billion, making him one of the wealthiest people in the world. If he had showed up for the hearing, Sanders said he would have asked Bezos why he is doing “everything in his power” to prevent workers in Bessemer from joining a union so they can negotiate for better wages, benefits and working conditions. “We’ll be asking about how it happens that the top one tenth of 1 percent now owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent,” Sanders said. “Two individuals — Bezos and Musk — now own more wealth than the bottom 40 percent, and meanwhile we are looking at more hunger in American than any time in decades.” It’s not just Bezos and Musk: The collective wealth of the 651 richest billionaires increased by more than $1 trillion during the pandemic. From his powerful perch on the budget committee, Sanders is taking on the billionaires he so often criticized on the presidential campaign trail and the “crisis of wealth and income inequality” that is the senator’s signature issue. On Wednesday, Sanders and other progressive lawmakers announced legislation that would raise taxes on companies that pay their CEOs at least 50 times more than the average worker, giving companies a choice between closing the wage gap or paying their “fair share” in taxes. In 1980, CEOs of major companies made an average of 42 times more money than the typical worker, but since 2000, CEOs have made an average of 350 times more than their typical employee, according to testimony submitted to the Senate budget committee by Sarah Anderson of the Institute for Policy Studies. The wage gap ballooned in the 1990s, when employee wages stagnated and executive pay exploded as more companies offered their CEOs compensation in stock. Anderson told the budget committee that, over the past few decades, jobs were outsourced to other countries while millions of others were turned into low-wage, part-time work without benefits, leaving families across the country vulnerable when the pandemic hit. Even with COVID relief from the government, millions of families have gone hungry during the pandemic, and nearly one in five of renters fell behind on rent within nine months. “This growing pay divide has been a significant driver of gender and racial disparities,” Anderson said in her prepared remarks. “Women and people of color make up a disproportionately large share of today’s low-wage workers and a distressingly tiny share of corporate leaders.” Nearly 80 percent of S&P 500 companies paid their CEO more than 100 times the median salary for their average worker in 2018, and nearly 10 percent had median pay below the federal poverty line for a family of four, according to Anderson. At the 50 publicly traded U.S. corporations with the widest pay gaps, the typical employee would have to work at least 1,000 years to earn what their CEO does annually. Under the Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act, the legislation introduced by Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and two other senators this week, corporations that pay their top executives between 50 and 100 times the median salary offered to typical workers would see a 0.5 percent increase in their federal taxes. Taxes increase as the pay gap widens, with a maximum 5 percent tax increase applied to companies that pay executives 500 times what the average worker is paid. If Walmart, for example, refused to transfer wealth from executives to workers, the company would have paid up to $854.9 million more taxes last year under the legislation. Amazon’s success during the pandemic has made the company a poster child for inequality. Amazon’s workforce — which is disproportionately Black – worked risky, front line jobs as more shoppers went online during the pandemic, but the company has shared little of its profits with its workers , according to the Brookings Institute. Amazon’s additional profits over the past year are more than five times the amount of extra money paid to workers for staying on the job despite COVID, and the company ended its $2 per hour hazard pay program last summer. Bezos’s personal wealth grew by at least $68 billion during the pandemic (Sanders put that figure at $77 billion) — about 38 times more than the total amount Amazon spent on hazard pay for workers since the pandemic began. “Amazon brags it pays workers above the minimum wage,” Bates said. “What they don’t tell you is what those jobs are really like. And they certainly don’t tell you that they can afford to do much better for their workers.” Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan), one of the bill’s co-sponsors in the House, said workers in the U.S. cannot afford to wait for CEOs to “do the right thing.” “Corporate greed is a disease that has long afflicted this country — but the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the gross income inequality and pay gap between CEOs and their employees in a way it never has been before,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib . “Amid this crisis, Amazon’s profits more than tripled as sales soared and its warehouse workers risked their lives to make that possible — without hazard pay.” The Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act faces an uphill battle in Congress and especially in the Senate, where Democrats hold only the slimmest majority. However, such a proposal could attract public support. Most Americans — 61 percent — say there is too much inequality in the U.S., including 78 percent of Democrats, according to the Pew Research Center. A 2016 survey found that 74 percent of Americans think CEOs are paid too much compared to the average workers, and 62 percent — including more than half of Republicans and two-thirds of Democrats — favor capping CEO pay relative to worker pay. Meanwhile, Bates and other Amazon workers will continue fighting for a union, which would allow them to negotiate for better working conditions and higher pay. “We need better working conditions, we need a better wage for living, we need job security, so it’s important for us that the union come so Amazon will have the opportunity to sit down and talk to us to get these issues resolved,” Bates said. The increasing transfer of wealth from the working and middle classes to the ultra-rich in recent decades followed the decline of unions, according to Robert Reich, the former U.S. Labor Secretary and professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, in testimony before the budget committee. Reich said less than 7 percent of workers are currently unionized, but 50 years ago one third were part of a union. Corporate power has only grown thanks to deregulation as the collective political power of workers has declined, creating a “power imbalance” that reflects the massive gaps between what executives and workers are paid. “Given the increasing power of large corporations and the decreasing power of workers it is not surprising that corporate profits have increased as a portion of the total economy while wages have declined,” Reich said in prepared testimony , adding that corporations have increased profits by keeping wages low. Democrats are currently pushing the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, a bill that recently passed the House and is considered by the labor movement to be the most pro-union legislation in decades. The PRO Act would make it easier for workers to join unions – and harder for companies like Amazon to get in their way. Like raising the minimum wage and other pro-worker priorities for Sanders and progressive allies, passing the PRO Act and the Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act would likely require ending the filibuster in the Senate, where Democrats enjoy only the slimmest majority and Republicans dismiss Sanders’s claim that inequality is reaching “crisis” levels. President Biden is skeptical about abolishing the filibuster , but he has hinted at support for reform that would require lawmakers to hold the floor when blocking legislation. Reports suggest the White House’s position on the filibuster is softening as it becomes increasingly clear that the GOP’s top priority is blockading Biden’s agenda. As Democrats wrangle over a legislative path forward, Sanders remains focused on his core message: Inequality is reaching unprecedented levels during a deep crisis, and the billionaires profiting during a pandemic should share the wealth with workers who create it. “The simple truth is that today in America the very, very rich are getting much richer, while tens of millions of working-class Americans are struggling to put food on the table and take care of their basic needs,” Sanders said.
With Democrats and Republicans now both firmly behind the Space Force, it seems there is no going back. Republicans’ recent loss of control over the federal government means it’s fake outrage season in Washington, D.C. Last week, conservative lawmakers marked the occasion by lambasting White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki for allegedly failing to show sufficient reverence for the Space Force, the new branch of the U.S. Armed Forces established in 2019 under the administration of Donald Trump to assert U.S. military dominance in outer space . At a press conference on February 2, Psaki responded to a question about President Joe Biden’s support for Trump’s creation by joking about the Space Force being “the plane of today” — a reference to how she had fielded questions about the color of Air Force One during the previous day’s press conference, and how the questions about the Space Force were subsequently taking center stage. “It is an interesting question. I am happy to check with our Space Force point of contact,” Psaki added. “I’m not sure who that is. I will find out and see if we have any update on that.” While most wouldn’t have batted an eyelash at those remarks, Republicans flew into a fury . Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, the leading Republican on the House Armed Services, accused Psaki of using “an entire branch of our military as the punchline of a joke, which I’m sure China would find funny.” Rep. Michael Waltz of Florida charged Psaki with “demeaning the incredible work of Space Force personnel.” In response to the GOP attacks, Psaki clarified the Biden administration’s staunchly pro-Space Force position. “We look forward to the continuing work of Space Force and invite the members of the team to come visit us in the briefing room anytime to share an update on their important work,” she said in a tweet posted hours after her plane quip. “They absolutely have the full support of the Biden administration,” Psaki said of Space Force personnel at the next day’s press conference. But while Republicans were publicly sweating the future of the military branch, or at least pretending to, it’s unlikely that the defense industry was worried. The bill establishing the Space Force passed Congress in 2019 with overwhelming bipartisan support . Several Democrats in both the House and Senate also crossed the aisle last year to form bipartisan Space Force caucuses in each chamber. Four Democrats who still serve in Congress co-founded the caucuses: Senators Kyrsten Sinema (Arizona) and Martin Heinrich (New Mexico), and Reps. Charlie Crist (Florida) and Jason Crow (Colorado). Within days of co-founding the House Space Force caucus, Crist received $3,000 from the Political Action Committee (PAC) of Blue Origin , the spaceflight contractor founded and owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos. Crist also received $2,500 from aerospace giant Northrop Grumman ’s PAC early last September, weeks before the establishment of the House Space Force Caucus. The two companies are among top Space Force contractors that have preferred donating to Democrats over Republicans in the past few years. In the most recent election cycle, individuals employed by Blue Origin and the company’s PAC gave Democratic candidates for federal office $209,103 while giving Republicans $95,494. Northrop Grumman ’s PAC and individuals employed by the company gave Democratic candidates $1,449,859 while giving Republican candidates $1,153,363. And employees and executives and the PAC run by SpaceX , the company owned by billionaire Elon Musk, gave Democrats $468,772 while giving Republicans $274,914. The Pentagon has relied on these three companies alongside United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to get Space Force off the ground, both figuratively and literally (ULA donors preferred Republican candidates last election cycle). The four firms have each been paid hundreds of millions of dollars to develop space launch technology for the U.S. military. The Space Force announced last August that it would end launch technology partnerships with Blue Origin and Northrop Grumman, but the latter still has plenty of business with the branch, including a $2.3 billion contract to develop satellites for a missile warning system. In December, Bezos’s firm reacted to its loss by establishing an advisory board staffed by seven ex-NASA and military officials to help compete for “lucrative government contracts,” in the words of Reuters . Though the Space Force is heavily associated with President Trump, Democrats have been pushing the U.S. military for years to ratchet up its celestial presence. In January, The New York Times published a lengthy piece detailing how the Obama administration boosted the Pentagon’s “offensive space control” capabilities by churning $7.2 billion in contracts through 67 companies. “The beneficiaries included Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon,” the paper noted (Musk was not actually one of Tesla’s founders, for the record). The push to militarize space started under the Bush administration in response to the Chinese military testing anti-satellite weaponry in 2007. In the years leading up to the test, however, the U.S.government repeatedly voted against U.N. General Assembly resolutions proposed by Russian diplomats, which sought to affirm that outer space should only be used for “peaceful purposes.” In 2005 and 2006, the resolutions “enjoyed support from an overwhelming majority, with only Israel abstaining and the United States objecting,” as the Nuclear Threat Initiative noted. Three years before the first resolution, Russia and China had released a paper entitled: “Possible Elements for a Future International Legal Agreement on the Prevention of the Deployment of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects.” But with Democrats and Republicans now both firmly behind Space Force, it seems there is no going back. In December 2019, days before Congress first advanced legislation to create the branch, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the U.S. military’s new focus on outer space would force the Russian government “to pay increased attention to strengthening the orbital group, as well as the rocket and space industry as a whole.” The call from Putin reinforced warnings from critics of the Space Force worried about the proliferation of weapons in the thermosphere and beyond. Laura Grego, a physicist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the establishment of the U.S. military branch “would prompt a space arms race that would threaten U.S. military and civilian satellites, not protect them.” “Creating a new military service focused on space will create bureaucratic incentives to hype the space weapons threat and build new weapons,” Grego added.
The wealthiest people in the world made historic income gains in 2020 as most people struggled to afford rent and food. Bloomberg ’s year-end report on the wealth of the world’s billionaires shows that the richest 500 people on the planet added $1.8 trillion to their combined wealth in 2020, accumulating a total net worth of $7.6 trillion. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index recorded its largest annual gain in the list’s history last year, with a 31% increase in the wealth of the richest people. The historic hoarding of wealth came as the world confronted the coronavirus pandemic and its corresponding economic crisis, which the United Nations last month warned is a “tipping point” set to send more than 207 million additional people into extreme poverty in the next decade — bringing the number of people living in extreme poverty to one billion by 2030. Even in the richest country in the world, the United States, the rapidly widening gap between the richest and poorest people grew especially stark in 2020. As Dan Price, an entrepreneur and advocate for fair wages, tweeted, the 500 richest people in the world amassed as much wealth in 2020 as “the poorest 165 million Americans have earned in their entire lives.” The 500 wealthiest people got almost $2 trillion richer in the pandemic, which is what the poorest 165 million Americans have earned in their entire lives, combined And those 500 pay the lowest tax rate of any group in the country — Dan Price (@DanPriceSeattle) January 2, 2021 Nine of the top 10 richest people in the world live in the United States and own more than $1.5 trillion. Meanwhile, with more than half of U.S. adults living in households that lost income due to the pandemic, nearly 26 million Americans reported having insufficient food and other groceries in November — contributing to a rise in shop-lifting of essential goods including diapers and baby formula. About 12 million renters were expected to owe nearly $6,000 in back rent after the new year. Tesla CEO Elon Musk enjoyed an historic growth in wealth last year, becoming the second richest person in the world and knocking Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates down to third place. Musk’s total net worth grew by $142 billion in 2020, to $170 billion — the fastest creation of personal wealth in history, according to Bloomberg. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is at the top of the list, with a net worth of $190 billion. Bezos added more than $75 billion to his wealth in 2020, as the public grew dependent on online shopping due to Covid-19 restrictions and concern for public health. While Bezos and a select few others in the U.S. have amassed historic gains in personal wealth in the last year, the federal government has yet to extend much in the way of meaningful assistance to struggling Americans. The Republican-led Senate on Friday continued to stonewall a vote on legislation that would send $2,000 checks to many American households. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) denounced the proposal as “socialism for rich people” even though the plan includes a phaseout structure and individuals making only up to $115,000 per year — not those in the highest tax brackets — would receive checks. “Surging billionaire wealth hits a painful nerve for the millions of people who have lost loved ones and experienced declines in their health, wealth, and livelihoods,” Chuck Collins, director of the Program on Inequality and the Common Good at the Institute for Policy Studies, told Bloomberg this week. “Worse, it undermines any sense that we are ‘in this together’ — the solidarity required to weather the difficult months ahead.”
The richest Americans are getting richer as millions struggle to afford basic necessities. The net wealth enjoyed by the richest billionaires in the United States has ballooned since the beginning of the pandemic, according to a new report. Meanwhile, millions of households are struggling to put food on the table and pay rent as COVID-19 deaths and infections surge nationwide, underscoring our nation’s vast inequality. The collective wealth of the 651 richest billionaires has increased by over $1 trillion since March 18, roughly when states began issuing shutdown orders, according to a new analysis of Forbes financial data by Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies. The combined net worth of the richest people in the U.S. totaled $4 trillion this week — more than four times the $908 billion price tag of an economic relief package that has taken center stage in the Senate as Congress struggles to strike a bipartisan deal before the end of the year. A stock market surge combined with more people staying at home has been a boon for tech companies and their CEOs. Familiar names in tech top the report’s list of the richest people getting richer: Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Elon Musk of Tesla. The four men have seen stock prices for their companies soar since the pandemic began, making them “centi-billionaires” worth over $100 billion each. Then there is Dan Gilbert, chairman of Quicken Loans, a company specializing in short and long-term personal loans and home mortgages. As people struggle to pay their bills, Gilbert’s wealth has grown 543 percent from $6.1 billion to $41.8 billion, the second highest increase among billionaires after the net increase enjoyed by Ernest Garcia II, who makes his fortune selling used cars. The economy looks much different to the rest of us. Millions of people have lost jobs during the pandemic and food and housing insecurity have skyrocketed to crisis levels. Across the country, images of cars lined up for miles to receive food donations have illustrated the severity of the crisis. More than 1 in 10 adults sometimes or often do not have enough money for food, according estimates based on federal Census data. Last month, more than half of the country worried about affording food as the holidays approached. About 34 percent of the country — roughly 83 million adults — report difficulty paying for basic expenses such as food, medical bills and mortgage payments. An estimated 40 percent of children live in homes that are either behind on rent or facing food hardship, and rates of food insecurity are even higher among families of color. At least 12 million people are now behind on rent, and housing activists are fighting evictions across the country despite a federal moratorium on evictions set to expire at the end of the month. “As tens of millions of Americans suffer from the health and economic ravages of this pandemic, a few hundred billionaires add to their massive fortunes,” said Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, in a statement. “Their pandemic profits are so immense that America’s billionaires could pay for a major COVID relief bill and still not lose a dime of their pre-virus riches.” Meanwhile, layoffs appear to be on the rise alongside the surge in new COVID-19 cases, which topped 218,667 nationally on Wednesday. Another 1.3 million people filed new unemployment claims last week, bringing initial claims to their highest point since September, according to the Economic Policy Institute. People who have relied on unemployment insurance since the pandemic began are seeing their incomes dwindle as benefits run dry. If Congress fails to pass a relief package before year-end deadlines, 12 million people will lose their unemployment benefits after Christmas. As of November 14, 20 million people were collecting unemployment nationally, according to the Labor Department. Nearly 98,000 businesses have closed permanently. On Thursday, the Washington Post reported that negotiations over another relief package in Congress are on the verge of collapse. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned talks could extend beyond Christmas, when multiple programs provided by the stimulus package passed in March are set to expire. A $908 billion bipartisan proposal at the center of the negotiations would not provide a second round of stimulus checks to all taxpayers. The proposal would extend emergency unemployment benefits until March with a $300 weekly bonus, potentially helping millions of households from falling off a fiscal cliff. However, there is currently not enough Republican support in the Senate to pass the stopgap relief package, according to reports. The relief package would also provide $160 billion in relief for state and local governments, along with $25 billion in housing assistance for renters, although housing advocates say at least $100 billion is needed. Democrats hope a final deal will include an extended moratorium on evictions. Without relief, an estimated 30 to 40 million people could lose their homes, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Clemente said the $1 trillion in new wealth enjoyed by the 651 top billionaires could provide relief to the entire country. Indeed, $1 trillion is double the two-year budget gap faced by all state and local governments, according to the report. “Their wealth growth is so great that they alone could provide a $3,000 stimulus payment to every man, woman and child in the country, and still be richer than they were 10 months ago,” Clemente said. The report on wealth gains among billionaires received favorable review from the fact-checkers at PolitiFact. On the campaign trail, President-elect Joe Biden claimed billionaires “in this country are seeing their wealth increase by $800 billion” during the pandemic, a statement PolitiFact rated “mostly true” based on the report. Biden campaigned on raising taxes on the wealthy, and Clemente said he must make good on that promise after entering the White House on January 20. “Joe Biden won a tax-fairness mandate in November,” Clemente said. “We look forward to working with him and Congress to deliver on that mandate by taxing the massive wealth of these billionaires.”
Among the most important factors contributing to the explosion in billionaire wealth are Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. Billionaire wealth increased to $10.2 trillion through the end of July, setting a new record amid the coronavirus pandemic even as millions of unemployed people fall into poverty. Wealth held by billionaires around the world rose to $10.2 trillion in July, up from the previous record of $8.9 trillion in 2017, according to an analysis by Swiss bank UBS and consulting firm PwC . The number of billionaires also rose from 2,158 in 2017 to 2,189 this summer, according to the report. Not all billionaires saw their wealth increase, though some saw their wealth rise by close to 50%. Health care billionaires, for example, saw their wealth increase by 50%. Technology billionaires saw their wealth rise by 42.5%. Billionaires in the entertainment, financial services, materials, and real estate sectors saw increases of 10% or less. While the UBS analysis looked at billionaires around the world, a separate analysis by the Institute for Policy Studies and Americans for Tax Fairness found that billionaire wealth in the United States has grown by $792 billion, or 27%, since the beginning of coronavirus lockdowns in March. The combined wealth of American billionaires now tops $3.7 trillion. Some prominent billionaires have done particularly well. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has seen his wealth rise more than 60% during the pandemic to $195 billion through late August, according to the analysis. Tesla CEO Elon Musk saw his wealth more than triple to $85 billion over that time frame. The study pointed to President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, which helped billionaires keep more of their earnings. The UBS study noted that Trump’s desired capital gains tax cut, billed as a pandemic-related stimulus, would overwhelmingly favor the richest Americans . “For billionaires, this is a heads-we win, tails-you-lose economy, boosted by Trump policies to funnel wealth to the top,” Chuck Collins, the head of the Institute for Policy Studies’ Program on Inequality, said in a news release . “The pandemic profiteering of America’s billionaires shows taxes on the wealthy must go up substantially to narrow the wealth gap and raise revenue vital for our big climb back from disaster,” added Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness. “By demanding even more tax cuts for the rich at this crucial moment President Trump shows he is as out of touch with our nation’s needs as America’s billionaires are disconnected from our nation’s misery.” Some executives, like Zoom CEO Eric Yuan and Bezos, have profited from a boom in business caused by the lockdowns. Others have profited directly from government aid distributed to their companies. But most billionaires saw their wealth increase due to rising investments, buoyed by a stock market surge propped up by government assistance . The rising wealth amid an economically devastating pandemic threatens to deepen longstanding inequalities. “Extreme wealth concentration is an ugly phenomenon from a moral perspective, but it’s also economically and socially destructive,” Luke Hilyard, the executive director of the High Pay Center, a think tank that focuses on excessive executive pay, told The Guardian . “Anyone accumulating riches on this scale could easily afford to raise the pay of the employees who generate their wealth, or contribute a great deal more in taxes to support vital public services, while remaining very well rewarded for whatever successes they’ve achieved. The findings from the UBS report showing that the super-rich are getting even richer are a sign that capitalism isn’t working as it should.” UBS executive Josef Stadler also acknowledged that billionaires could face societal backlash over their growing wealth as many people face months if not years of struggles. “We’re at an inflection point,” he told the outlet. “Wealth concentration is as high as in 1905, this is something billionaires are concerned about. The problem is the power of interest on interest – that makes big money bigger and, the question is to what extent is that sustainable and at what point will society intervene and strike back?” But it’s far from the first time that billionaires profited while millions suffered. The Institute for Policy Studies found that the wealthiest 400 billionaires in the US not only recovered from the 2008 recession within three years but increased their wealth by 80% over the following decade. By comparison, the bottom 80% of earners have still not recovered. While government intervention has helped billionaires accumulate even more wealth, the lack of government action since the spring has resulted in an estimated 8 million Americans falling into poverty since May, according to a study from researchers at Columbia University . The lack of additional stimulus payments and the expiration of enhanced federal unemployment benefits has resulted in 6 million Americans falling into poverty over just the last three months, according to a study from researchers at the University of Chicago and Notre Dame . The problem has been even worse globally. Between 88 million and 114 million people around the world have fallen into extreme poverty, defined as living on less than $1.90 per day, since the pandemic hit, according to the World Bank . There are now more than 700 million people living in extreme poverty and researchers expected that number to keep rising. “This is the worst setback that we’ve witnessed in a generation,” Carolina Sánchez-Páramo, the global director of the World Bank’s Poverty and Equity Global Practice, told The Wall Street Journal . World Bank Group President David Malpass argued in a speech this month that the problem is worse in developing economies because “rich countries” have the resources to expand sweeping “government spending programs” while poorer economies have few tools to mitigate the economic damage. The US, by contrast, should be doing better if not for Republican reluctance to increased government relief . Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned Congress last month that inaction in the face of growing inequality would be highly damaging to the economic recovery. “Those are things that hold back our economy,” he said at a news conference . “If we want to have the highest potential output and the best output for our economy, we need that prosperity to be very broadly spread.” Many analysts have also faulted Powell and the Fed for contributing to the growing inequality with policies “disproportionately benefiting stockholders,” according to the Associated Press . Just as the coronavirus has exposed longstanding health disparities between the richest and poorest Americans, the growing inequality is largely the result of a “catastrophic failure to tackle inequality” well before the pandemic struck, according to a report from Oxfam International . “Governments’ catastrophic failure to tackle inequality meant the majority of the world’s countries were critically ill-equipped to weather the pandemic,” said Oxfam interim executive director Chema Vera. “No country on earth was trying hard enough to reduce inequality and ordinary people are bearing the brunt of this crisis as a result. Millions of people have been pushed into poverty and hunger and there have been countless unnecessary deaths.”
This is neoliberal policy to the core. In June, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s administration selected Elon Musk’s The Boring Company to build a non-stop express train from downtown to O’Hare Airport. The development is yet another example of Emanuel’s plan to transform Chicago into a city for the wealthy few. Emanuel has stated that Musk’s express train will be fully financed by private investors. But the city’s 2009 parking meter fiasco has taught us that working Chicagoans end up on the losing side of fast-tracked privatization schemes. Morgan Stanley Investment Partners (MSIP) paid the city over $1 billion to lease the city’s parking meter system. But in an information memorandum released in 2010, MSIP estimated that, by the end of the lease in 2084, the firm would rake in over $11 billion from parking meter users by charging higher fares. As with the parking meter deal, Emanuel’s O’Hare express privatization scheme will first and foremost benefit the same set of corporate elites who have profited from years of cuts to public goods and services. Under Emanuel, Chicago has been on the forefront of both recruiting corporate headquarters and displacing African-Americans. Tax giveaways meant to entice corporate CEOs have coincided with school closings in poor neighborhoods of color and service cuts that have made life in Chicago untenable for many working families. As a result, the city faces extreme economic disparity, hosting a racial wealth divide far worse than the US average. Soon after Emanuel closed 49 public schools in 2013 in part to reduce $100 million from the Chicago Public Schools budget, he authorized a $55 million taxpayer handout to support the development of the Wintrust/DePaul Stadium project and a Marriott Hotel near McCormick Place Convention Center. Since being opened, the stadium has fallen short of attendance predictions and, as studies have shown , such publicly funded sports arenas don’t actually spur economic growth but they do leave taxpayers buried in more debt. This is neoliberal policy at its core: the public sector is slashed while assets and services are left in the hands of the private market. Although Musk’s project would be the first airport express train project of its kind in the United States, such ventures in other countries have concentrated public wealth in private hands. A study conducted for SNCF French National Railways finds that 84 percent of private airport express train investors across the globe overestimate the number of riders they will attract by at least 20 percent. When such privately funded trains fail to hit their ridership targets, the projects can expect a public bailout to keep the trains running. For example, lower than expected ridership on Vancouver’s airport express train forced the Canadian government to pay its private financier over $20 million a year. The proposed O’Hare express train, set to cost riders an estimated $25 for a one-way ticket, is poised to further deepen Chicago’s crises of growing inequality, neighborhood neglect and displacement of longtime residents. As previous CTA plans have suggested, the express train will likely be given priority over expanding and maintaining local train service, which could ultimately force working people who rely on the Blue Line to experience reduced service and longer travel times. In light of the growing unaffordability of the city, Mayor Emanuel should be prioritizing ways to make the city more affordable and accessible for everyday residents. He should focus on adding more bus and train service frequency to reduce long wait times and overcrowding, and more train or bus rapid transit connections to job centers in the suburbs. Instead of building a second train line to O’Hare airport, which will disproportionately benefit the rich, why not make public transit free for everyone and provide CTA employees with a fair contract? In 2015, CTA collected $587 million from riders, on par with the nearly half billion collected by the city’s Tax Increment Financing districts each year between 2011 and 2015. Rather than creating slush funds for developers, the city could be providing free transit for Chicagoans. As always, these questions are not decided by actual financial means—or democracy—but by political priorities. With Musk’s O’Hare express train, Rahm Emanuel is once again prioritizing adding services and amenities for the rich—and sticking the rest of us with the bill.
Donald Trump knows perfectly well why his coastal golf course in County Clare, Ireland, is under siege by rising sea levels. Donald Trump knows perfectly well why his coastal golf course in County Clare, Ireland, is under siege by rising sea levels. Perhaps “walls” were on his mind when he spoke about the border of Mexico because he was forced to build a protective wall around his Ireland golf resort before it slowly slips out to sea, golf balls and millions of dollars with it. In the end, no wall will save it from catastrophic weather disasters that are the consequential effects of climate disruption. To summarize Dahr Jamail’s warnings : Humans are releasing carbon into the atmosphere 10-times faster than during the hottest mass extinction period in the past 66 million years, and it is the closest precedent for today’s greenhouse warming. Given Trump’s comprehension of the world’s stock of manageable assets in the private sector, he should know that global warming is creating a devastating ripple-effect in the markets of agriculture, construction, resorts, tourism and transportation, as he, himself, is experiencing firsthand by trying to protect his resorts from rising sea levels. Losses from climate change do not merely represent market volatility, but permanent damage to global assets. Furthermore, the fossil fuel industry is losing billions of dollars from extreme weather disasters. With the advent of super hurricanes, and excessive flooding, oil drilling is an expensive and extremely volatile business that is financially risky for most investors. A disturbing report released by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ), sets out in the starkest terms how much inaction on climate change is likely to cost the world economy. As reported in Reuters : Trillions of dollars of non-bank financial assets around the world are vulnerable to the effects of global warming, according to a study that says tougher action to curb greenhouse gas emissions makes sense for investors. Rising temperatures and the dislocation caused by related droughts, floods and heat-waves will slow global economic growth and damage the performance of stocks and bonds, according to the report, led by the London School of Economics. “It makes financial sense to a risk-neutral investor to cut emissions, and even more so to the risk-averse,” lead author Professor Simon Dietz, an environmental economist, told Reuters. This is how congressional Democrats should frame the arguments if they want to bridge the gap with Donald Trump by discussing climate change as a “financial disaster” and job-killer for businesses. If his decisions are, to rephrase Trump’s The Art of the Deal , “starting points for negotiation,” then providing proof of the enormous financial losses from climate change catastrophes should serve as a persuasive incentive for Trump to reach out to CEOs of renewable energy providers. For example, Telsa CEO Elon Musk intends to employ thousands of Americans as he begins production of his affordable Model 3 electric car. This year his goal is to build as many as 500,000 vehicles this year, and 1 million vehicles per year by 2020. And here’s something that I believe Trump would admire: Musk is completing the construction of his Gigafactory, a giant battery plant located in Sparks, Nevada. These batteries are capable of providing energy for homes and businesses, storing the energy from solar, and charging electric vehicles via the stored battery energy from the sun. This is not some futuristic idea: It’s all happening right now. I can imagine Musk making the following case to Trump: Instead of relying on coal plants for jobs, put coal miners to work in electric car factories where they can build batteries and electric vehicles. Put oil construction workers in solar and wind production. Provide industrial workers with good wages and benefits, and explain to them that by working in the renewable energy field, they will not only earn good incomes, they won’t have to worry about losing loved ones to lung cancer or dying horrific deaths from coal and oil explosions or being buried alive from cave-ins or burned alive in oil refineries, which happens more often than it should, which is why it’s vitally important for the federal government to enforce safety regulations. Most importantly, many financial assessments signify a booming job creation in the green energy sector, which far outnumber oil and coal jobs. Contrary to a large public demand for solar, wind and electric vehicles, jobs in coal and oil are usually temporary, dangerous, in terms of labor, and most of the work is completed by machines. To add insult to injury, industrial pollution produced by fossil fuels is typically dumped in working Americans’ backyards, contaminating their water and land with toxic waste. I assume that the incoming president would not like it if his resorts were polluted by a cesspool of poisonous chemicals? Trump surely must know that that’s why there are supposed to be federal and state environmental regulations to protect the public’s health from toxic pollutants. Obviously, Trump wouldn’t have to worry about pollution regulations regarding solar and wind production. You cannot fix the economy by relying on an archaic industrial model that is wrecking global economies, and worse, it’s driving all life on this planet rapidly towards extinction. Imagine if you kept telling investors that they’ll get rich if they bet on X’s racehorse. Never mind that the horse is 25 years old and that he can barely trot. Although Trump boasted about increasing production of fossil fuels in the United States, Marketplace reported that 365 businesses have urged Trump to stick with the Paris Climate Agreement. “They are committed to curbing carbon themselves , according to a statement released in Morocco where climate talks are taking place in order to give businesses the confidence to develop and implement strategies that are going to build advantage, lower risk, and lower their costs.” Regarding auto production of low emission vehicles, Marketplace’s contributing financial reporter, David Brancaccio , explained that “many people in those firms understand that they have to switch to clean vehicles that are not dependent on fossils fuels. The far-sighted people in those firms understand that if they don’t do it, some startup that nobody ever heard of 10 years ago, is going to become the General Motors, the Ford, the Toyota or whoever of the future, and we will only remember those legacy auto firms as something to study in history.” In other words, the fossil fuel billionaires cannot put the green energy genie back in the bottle. It’s here to stay. At the conclusion of this Reuter’s climate change article , Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, a European forum for 128 investors with more than 25 trillion euros in assets, announced that “changes towards greener growth were irreversible. Renewables have already overtaken coal as a global power source, electric vehicles are the growth segment of the auto industry and jobs are being created in clean energy sectors faster than any other.” If Donald Trump is truly interested in creating lots of jobs for Americans, then he should stop placing his bets on an old horse that can’t possibly win. In terms of rebuilding our infrastructure, Trump knows that other countries are way ahead of the United States: They’re building electric vehicle stations and lighting up their cities and homes with solar and wind, which has created thousands of new jobs in construction and engineering. If Trump continues to rely on an antiquated industrial 19th century energy paradigm, the US will become a horribly poor, polluted nation while other countries that are operating from the new “green” paradigm are rapidly becoming economically and ecologically secure. If Trump truly wants to put America back to work, he should start by hiring Elon Musk to head up his energy department instead of Myron Ebell, a climate contrarian from the buggy wagon era of the 19th century. Ebell is characterized as a “climate criminal.” In Paris, activists pasted mug shots of him during the United Nations climate talks as “wanted for destroying our future.” That’s not a very good selection if Trump truly wants to bridge the gap between Democrats and Republicans. Ebell’s brain is stuck in the 1940s. How many ways can I say it! The fossil fuel paradigm is no longer economically viable. My guess is that even Trump’s youngest son, Barron, knows more about the threat of climate change than Myron Ebell. Real change is not about forcing a circle into a square. Fossil fuels are not applicable to our current world reality. To quote Trump in his own words, what does he have to lose? Why not at least meet with Musk and top green energy executives to hear their side of how to go about creating millions of jobs for Americans that provide good incomes, benefits and the work is safe and clean?
